					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Thank you again, Mr. Secretary, for this interview, as you have just held a ministerial meeting to coordinate global efforts in the fight against COVID.  Why hold such a meeting at this time?  What are the concerns?  What commitments were made by the United States and other participants?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  Indeed, there were twenty countries represented today, including France, the EU, countries in Africa, like South Africa and Senegal, and countries around the world.  A leadership group is what is needed now to fill in the gaps.  We have established a very concrete action plan where we have jointly identified what is missing and together, we are determined to act, to use the unique skills of different countries and institutions to focus on addressing shortcomings.  For example, a huge international effort went into vaccine manufacturing.  Now we must distribute them better and make sure that they actually end up in the arms of those who need them.</p>
<p>This is due to supply chain problems as everything needed for vaccines and their distribution must be manufactured and on time.  There is also a problem of misinformation and disinformation.  We see people around the world who are susceptible to disinformation and so they do not take the vaccines that are available.  There is also the issue of supporting those working on the front lines and making sure they have what they need to be protected.  And finally, we must build a more efficient system for the future.</p>
<p>Of these areas, of our six lines of effort, we must work together because without this coordination, in the end, everyone will do their duty, but to truly be effective we must identify, together, the shortcomings and work together to try to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Speaking of challenges that remain in Africa, the vaccination rate hovers at 10 percent.  Scientists in South Africa recently produced a copy of the Moderna vaccine.  However, as long as patents remain, vaccination efforts in Africa are slowed down, and the end of the global pandemic is also slowed.  So, the United States had declared last year their support for waiving patent protections.  What can you do in the meantime, and is it possible to waive patent protections soon?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  This is an ongoing effort that we support.  However, we already see impressive results in Africa when there is a focused, coordinated effort.  In Uganda, for example, the vaccination rate in November was 11 or 12 percent.  There was a concerted effort with international partners, and after six weeks of effort, the rate is now 50 percent among adults.  This is what is possible when we identify what is needed in each case &#8212; each case is different.  Regarding patents, local production in addition to manufacturing in the United States or India is very important.  The issue of patents for the future is important, because, unfortunately, we know that there will be another pandemic.  We need to be better prepared and more effective.  For the moment, we are certain that we can put an end to COVID-19 when we work closely together to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  You visited the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal last November.  The Institut will manufacture COVID-19 vaccines with U.S. support thanks to a $3 million investment.  Can you give us an update on that project?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  I was very impressed by this visit to Senegal and the Institut Pasteur.  It showed not only the need, but also the production capacity that exists at the national and regional level around the world.  This will make it much more effective in the future to not be dependent on global supply chains and be able to shorten supply chains to be able to immediately respond during a crisis.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  The other big topic today is Ukraine.  According to several officials quoted by American media, the United States expects an invasion of Ukraine by Russia on Wednesday.  So, are you expecting an invasion this Wednesday?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  Alas, it is quite possible because President Putin has put in place everything necessary to carry out an act of aggression against Ukraine.  We see more and more Russian forces surrounding Ukraine: over 100,000 troops.  This is extremely worrying, including what is happening with the deployment in Belarus to the north of Ukraine.  It would be very easy for President Putin to indicate that he is ready to take the path of diplomacy.  That would start with de-escalating, by reducing the troops that are surrounding Ukraine, without provocation.  There is no reason for Russia to act like this. The only explanation we see is another act of aggression.  We also need to see this in the context of history.  This happened before, in 2014, with the annexation of Crimea and the intervention in Eastern Ukraine.  Knowing that history, we are very concerned when we see what is happening at Ukraine’s borders.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Apologies because we did not get a response to my question.  Are you saying, yes, it is possible?  I was asking about an attack on Wednesday &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  Yes, an act of aggression starting this week is completely possible when we look at what is happening with the deployment of Russian forces in the areas surrounding Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Would President Biden make a visit to Ukraine, as the president of Ukraine is requesting?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  President Biden is quite engaged in diplomacy right now.  He spoke today with President Zelenskyy.  He spoke previously with President Putin.  We will not speculate as we continue to pursue diplomacy.  However, it depends entirely on Russia.  Will they go ahead and withdraw forces from the areas surrounding Ukraine to allow for diplomacy to try to solve existing issues?  Or, on the contrary, will they continue not just to maintain but increase the forces already deployed around Ukraine and act with aggression as early as this week?</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  And Washington has publicly exposed Russia&#8217;s intentions and even their plans.  The United States is running a fairly aggressive communications campaign.  Is this a strategy to disrupt Moscow&#8217;s calculations?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  Yes, because people need to understand the tools that the Russians have used in the past and are still using today, including carrying out false flag operations to justify an intervention that they had planned in advance.  This is absolutely something they would do, and shedding light on it is perhaps a way to avoid it.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Now we’re going to switch to English if we can have an answer on the question on COVID.</p>
<p>(In English)  What is the U.S. doing to support African countries, in the meantime, while you are waiting for the COVID?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We just completed a meeting on COVID with 20 leading countries and institutions including France, including Senegal, South Africa.  All coming together to try to advance what we’re calling a global action plan.  We’ve identified the gaps that exist in making sure that we can get to the end of COVID-19.  And, together, having identified the gaps, we’re determined to try to fill them.  So, it’s getting shots in arms.  We’ve been doing a good job on producing vaccines, now we have to get them into arms.</p>
<p>It’s making sure the supply chains that are necessary for all the different inputs are strong and resilient, and building those out.  It’s dealing with the problem of disinformation and misinformation so people feel confident in taking the vaccines.  It’s supporting the healthcare workers who are on the frontlines, making sure they have the protection they need to do their jobs.  It’s building back a stronger global health system.  All of these things together are –we know now what needs to be done.  The only way to do it effectively though is to do it in a coordinated way.  And that’s exactly what these 20 countries and institutions are doing.  When it comes to, for example, making sure as well, in the future, that vaccines can be produced locally, that we have manufacturing and the licensing that’s necessary to do that.  That’s something we’re also working on and determined to see happen.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>And so according to many reports the U.S. believes that Russia could invade Ukraine on Wednesday.  Is that still your assessment?  And what is the U.S. goal with making all this in the public?  Is it to call Putin’s bluff?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We’re deeply concerned that Russia could take action against Ukraine as early as this week.  Everything we’re seeing in terms of the deployment of Russian forces around Ukraine, on every side of Ukraine, leads us to that conclusion.  Russia, instead of de-escalating, has been escalating, putting more and more forces in.  And so we are deeply concerned about that.  The path to diplomacy remains open.  We are doing everything we possibly can to convince Russia that it should take the diplomatic path, the path of dialogue, to resolve whatever differences exist peacefully, but, if it pursues aggression, we’re fully prepared for that, in close coordination with all of our European allies and partners.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Via translation)  And hasn’t this crisis strengthened the ties between the United States and its European allies?  Because there was still a lack of trust in the United States at the beginning of the Biden administration due to the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the submarine crisis.  So, do you feel that you have regained the trust of your European allies?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>I think this crisis has absolutely reinforced transatlantic solidarity.  We see that every single day.  And that’s a product of two things.  It’s a product of the threat, unfortunately, posed by Russian aggression.  But it’s also the product of the intense consultations and coordination that we’ve had throughout, going back several months.  We looked and added up and we’ve had just, in the last few weeks, more than 200 engagements—meetings, video conferences, telephone calls across the Atlantic with European partners, with the EU, with NATO, with the OSCE, with individual countries.  And all of this, I think, is pushing us closer together.  It’s a reminder of the values that we share, the interests that we need to defend together.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Perfect, thank you very much, it was excellent. Your French is still as good as ever.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)<b>  </b>Oh, that&#8217;s nice.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Via translation)  And thank you for the time.  We know it&#8217;s a very busy week.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>(Via translation)  Glad to see you again, thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It’s been a pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Rama here to the State Department, to the United States, and give us an opportunity to talk about the work that the United States and Albania are doing together in so many different areas, so many (inaudible).  We actually sit next to each other at the Security Council at the United Nations.  We’re grateful for the work that we’re doing there together.</p>
<p>But I have to tell you, Prime Minister, what stays with me and will stay with me for a long time is the fact that early in the summer, after we announced that we were going to leave Afghanistan and end the war there, you were the first to offer to take in Afghan refugees, evacuees, and that’s exactly what you’ve done.  I’m grateful to you and to the generosity of Albania that you gave safe harbor to well over 2,000 Afghans.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for that, but also for the work that we’re doing every day in Europe on security in close – increasingly close ties, particularly through NATO, and also, as I said, on the Security Council, where we have many challenging issues to work on together.  So very good to have you here.  I look forward to a very good conversation.  Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER RAMA:</strong>  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  It is an honor to be here, and of course, it’s also a true pleasure that we happen to see you in the beginning of a year that (inaudible) anniversary of our diplomatic relations.  They were brutally interrupted by Albania going a totally different direction for more than half a century, but here we are back together.</p>
<p>We value as most precious this friendship, this relation.  We are very proud to be on your side and to help as much as we can to give back what you have done for us during all these years, not just for Albania but also for Albanians in Kosovo and for Albanians all over.  So we are very proud to be your allies and we’ll do our best to deserve this special friendship.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.  Thanks, everyone.</p>

<p>The United States welcomes the lifting of the state of emergency in Ethiopia. This is another important step by the Government of Ethiopia to pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict. We urge that this move be immediately followed by the release of all individuals arrested or detained without charge under the state of emergency. The end of these detentions will facilitate an inclusive and productive national dialogue. The United States continues to engage with all parties to advance an immediate cessation of hostilities, unhindered humanitarian access, transparent investigations into all human rights abuses and violations, and a negotiated resolution to the conflict.</p>

<p>The following is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke today with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The Secretary reiterated the U.S. commitment to continue to pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis Moscow has precipitated. He stated that the United States looks forward to receiving Russia’s written response to the U.S. and NATO papers shared with Moscow last month proposing concrete areas for discussion regarding European security in coordination with our Allies and partners. He noted the Foreign Minister’s statement that it would be transmitted within the coming days. Secretary Blinken reiterated our ongoing concerns that Russia has the capacity to launch an invasion of Ukraine at any moment and emphasized the need to see verifiable, credible, meaningful de-escalation. He underscored that, while further Russian aggression against Ukraine would result in a swift, severe, and united Transatlantic response, we remain committed to the diplomatic path and believe that a window remains to resolve the crisis peacefully.</p>

<p>One year ago, the United States joined like-minded nations in sending an unambiguous message that the arbitrarily detention of foreign nationals is unacceptable and governments who engage in this practice must cease immediately.</p>
<p>The United States continues to call on the international community to collectively respond and press for the release of all those who are arbitrarily detained around the world.  We commend Canada for its leadership in the fight against the practice of imprisoning individuals for diplomatic leverage.  The Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention in State-to-State Relations now has 68 endorsements from nations around the world, and we urge others to support this initiative grounded in the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I congratulate the people of Serbia as you celebrate your national day.</p>
<p>Our countries have built strong ties over the last 140 years, and the United States looks forward to building an even brighter future together as partners in Europe and on the global stage.  We are committed to supporting Serbia’s goal of European integration, and we encourage comprehensive normalization of relations centered on mutual recognition with Kosovo, which will foster greater security and stability in the region.</p>
<p>We are proud to partner with Serbia on strengthening our economic ties, security cooperation, and supporting Serbia’s energy diversification.  Our economic partnership with Serbia grew significantly in 2021, with new investments in the infrastructure, technology, and agriculture sectors.  We also grew our bilateral defense cooperation, celebrating the 15<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the State Partnership Program, holding a significant bilateral airborne exercise, and conducting high-level bilateral military consultations.  Our strong bonds stem not only from what we accomplish between governments, but also from the shared endeavors and aspirations of everyday Serbian and American citizens, as witnessed by the Fulbright program’s 30th anniversary and the launching of new academic partnerships between U.S. and Serbian universities.</p>
<p>As we look ahead to building an even stronger bilateral relationship, I wish peace, prosperity, and good health to the people of Serbia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States is reaffirming our strong commitment to the Ukrainian people by joining with allies and partners to mobilize robust international support for Ukraine. The U.S. government is offering a sovereign loan guarantee to Ukraine of up to $1 billion to support its economic reform agenda and continued engagement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  This offer – combined with the strong partnership between Ukraine, the IMF, other international financial institutions, the G7 and other bilateral donors – will bolster Ukraine’s ability to ensure economic stability, growth, and prosperity for its people in the face of Russia’s destabilizing behavior.</p>
<p>This action builds on the support the United States, our allies, and partners, including the G7 and international financial institutions, have provided Ukraine to help protect its economy amid Russian pressure in recent years. Between 2014 and 2016, the United States issued three separate $1 billion sovereign loan guarantees to Ukraine. These loan guarantees played a critical role in helping Ukraine successfully stabilize its economy amid previous Russian aggression and implement a bold economic reform agenda underpinned by ambitious cooperation with the IMF.  The United States has provided over $2 billion in development assistance to Ukraine since 2014. The U.S. government has also worked to promote commercial participation by U.S. companies across the Ukrainian economy.  The Export-Import Bank of the United States intends to make available up to $3 billion to facilitate procurement of U.S. goods and services for projects in Ukraine, while the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation has a current investment portfolio in Ukraine of approximately $800 million across more than a dozen projects.</p>
<p>We are exploring additional ways to support Ukraine and its people, and we will continue to work with Congress to advance these efforts.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Nearly three years into the COVID-19 pandemic, global suffering continues despite heroic efforts by our healthcare workers, private citizens, institutions, organizations, countries, and economies.  Throughout, it has remained a fact that no one country acting alone can stop the virus.  As President Biden has made clear since the September 2021 Global COVID-19 Summit, vaccinating the world, saving lives now, and building back better require concerted global action.  Together, the international community can end the acute phase of the pandemic. Today’s COVID-19 Global Action Meeting was an important step toward achieving this shared goal.</p>
<p>Today I convened foreign ministers and senior leaders from countries and international organizations who will help coordinate additional leadership, political will, capacity, and resources, to achieve specific targets in the global COVID-19 response. Together, we identified urgent gaps in response activities and aligned around specific roles to advance global efforts aimed at bringing this pandemic under control and strengthening readiness for future global health threats. We agreed that more political leadership is needed to save lives and end this pandemic cycle in 2022.</p>
<p>We also discussed the COVID-19 Prioritized Global Action Plan for Enhanced Engagement (GAP), which outlines six lines of global effort to respond to acute pandemic needs.  Participants committed to lead coordination roles and concrete actions in support of these elements to complement efforts of WHO and other multilateral organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>To Get Shots in Arms, participants discussed coordinated efforts to improve vaccine readiness and logistics, in step with increased donations and procurement, toward the goal of at least 70 percent of the population fully vaccinated with quality, safe, and effective vaccines in every country and income category by September 2022. We recognized the need to focus on difficult-to-reach populations.</li>
<li>To Bolster Supply Chain Resilience, participants explored mechanisms to facilitate sufficient and steady supplies of critical products and materials that are needed to break this cycle of the COVID-19 pandemic, including establishing mechanisms to identify and remove medical supply chain bottlenecks.</li>
<li>To Address Information Gaps, participants considered global efforts to enhance vaccine confidence and combat the spread of false information, enlisting regional champions and medical, civil society, young people, and faith leaders to use evidence based, accurate, locally relevant messaging.</li>
<li>To Support Health Workers, participants emphasized the need to take action toward the health, safety, and wellbeing of frontline health workers, and recognized the need to improve their training and numbers to effectively support the COVID-19 response.</li>
<li>To Ensure Acute Non-Vaccine Interventions, we discussed the need for greater collaboration and policy innovation in the provision of therapeutics, testing regimes, and oxygen where needed most.</li>
<li>To Strengthen Global Health Security Architecture, participants also stressed the importance to both end the current pandemic and. secure future preparedness for health emergencies at the national, regional and global level.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will remain engaged on all six lines of effort in the GAP, and we will redouble our commitment to strengthen efforts to get shots in arms, bolster supply chain resilience, and strengthen the global health security architecture in collaboration with multilateral efforts.  I also announced the U.S. government is making a direct donation of 5 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine to the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVAT), the African Union’s vaccine procurement and distribution effort. The first five million doses are already shipping to countries across the continent. Together with doses provided in partnership with COVAX, this brings the total doses the United States has donated to Africa to more than 155 million – as part of the 435 million doses donated worldwide.</p>
<p>Throughout the meeting, we recognized the progress made over the duration of the pandemic and the challenges that remain.  Everyone has a role to play in ending this acute phase of the pandemic.  The implementation and achievement of the GAP depends on collaboration between governments, NGOs, multilateral organizations, the private sector, philanthropic institutions, civil society, and private citizens. In that spirit, the United States looks forward to continued consultations bringing together an expanded group of partners in action-oriented roles to help end this pandemic cycle in 2022 and strengthen global health security. We call on our partners and allies to build on the leadership expressed today and make tangible commitments that will help us reach this important goal.</p>
<p>Participants joining the United States in the COVID-19 Global Action Meeting included the Commonwealth of Australia, Canada, the Republic of Colombia, the French Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of India, the Republic of Indonesia, the Italian Republic, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Republic of Senegal, the Republic of South Africa, the Kingdom of Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the African Union/Africa Centres for Disease Control, the European Commission, and the World Health Organization.</p>
