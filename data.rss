					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>San Jose, Costa Rica</p>
<p>Chief of Mission Residence </p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Speaks in Spanish.)</p>
<p>(In English) So, Secretary, thank you for joining us. It’s your first visit to the region. You’ve come to Costa Rica, a very important ally. What did you hear? What are you taking? What are you taking to Vice President Harris, who will come to the region next week?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Well, first of all, it’s no accident that we’ve come to Costa Rica on this first trip to Latin America and Central America more specifically. Costa Rica’s such a strong partner for the United States when it comes to standing up for democracy, when it comes to working together on security, when it comes to leading on dealing with climate change. And coming here was an opportunity in the first instance to reinforce what is already an incredibly strong partnership.</p>
<p>But beyond that, we had a very important opportunity to meet with all of our counterparts and colleagues from across the region, from across Central America, and to talk about what I think we all hope, which is that we can build a future for people in Central America that has genuine hope and genuine opportunity. Our lives are so intertwined – the United States, the countries of Central America. We’re so interconnected that I think what I take away is we have an obligation but also an opportunity to work on these things together and offer people in all of our countries a greater sense of opportunity, a greater sense of hope. And that’s certainly what I’ll share with Vice President Harris, who’s very much looking forward to her visit in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> One of the concerns in the region, as in the rest of the world, is the pandemic, the access to vaccines. China and Russia have a big advantage on the U.S. on distributing their vaccines. Did the U.S. miss an opportunity to help these countries (inaudible) to bring down the pandemic by not distributing the vaccines before? And when will the vaccines be in the region?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Well, first, as you know, one of the first things that we did – that President Biden did upon taking office – was to re-engage with the World Health Organization, and then we very quickly made a very significant contribution to COVAX, this international facility to make sure that vaccines are accessible and are distributed on an equitable basis – $2 billion, with another 2 billion to be contributed between now and the end of next year as other countries contribute more. We’re by far the leading contributor to COVAX.</p>
<p>Having said that, President Biden also announced a few weeks ago that we will begin to make available around the world, including in this hemisphere, 80 million vaccines that we now have access to that we will, as I said, begin to make available. But here’s what’s important: We’ll distribute those vaccines working in coordination with COVAX, doing some of the work directly ourselves. We’ll do it on the basis of equity. We’ll do it on the basis of science and need. And we will do it without political strings attached, which has not been the case for some other countries that have been engaged in providing vaccines.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You met with the foreign ministers and you talked about American values – democracy, sustainability. After you met them, Government of Nicaragua started a legal process against Cristiana Chamorro, a journalist who’s considered a candidate who hadn’t announced her candidacy to the elections. This morning they raided her home; this afternoon they issued an arrest warrant against her. What is your reaction to that? You come to the region, you meet with the foreign minister, and this is how they react.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> We’ve been very disturbed by the steps that Nicaragua has taken – backward, not forward in terms of putting in place what is necessary for free and fair elections. And this is not only something that is of concern to the United States. It’s of concern to virtually every country in the region, as reflected in the work of the Organization of American States that made very clear requests of Nicaragua to put in place the processes and mechanisms necessary for free and fair elections. Nicaragua has moved in exactly the wrong direction. So this is something that we’re concerned about that all of our – virtually all of our partners in the region are.</p>
<p>And I would just say that the events also of the last 24 hours, as we see the opposition being denied the ability to compete in elections as we see the space squeezed for different voices. It is – I think the sign of a total lack of confidence because when I hear our Nicaraguan counterparts talking about all of the positive things the government has done for the people – given all of that, I would think that they would welcome the judgement of the people in free and fair elections. Apparently they don’t.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>You’re not new to the region. The region isn’t new to President Biden, but you have an issue of people going to the border.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And people even after they’re told that they’re not going to be allowed in, they say they have nothing to lose. $4 billion of investment were announced, but how are you going to do it? How are you going to convince people not to go? And how are you going to solve this issue that needs a prompt and quick solution when the problems that generate it take many years to solve?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>Well, it needs two things. You’re right. It needs a prompt and quick solution, but it also needs a long-term sustainable solution. The prompt and quick solution involves doing what we’re doing now in close partnership with Mexico but also in different ways with Guatemala, with Honduras, and El Salvador and that is, first of all, making it clear that the border is not open, that people should not come, that they’re putting their lives in tremendous jeopardy to try to make it to the border, and they will not be able to enter the United States.</p>
<p>Even as we’re doing the very important work of reforming our asylum system so that those in the future who come seeking asylum can have their cases adjudicated effectively and humanely, making sure that there are protections in place for migrants, looking to increase legal pathways to come to the United States, to work in the United States, including the increase in temporary worker visas. All of these things we’re putting in place as we are securing the border, but even if that’s a short-term response, it doesn’t answer the long-term problem. This is why I think your question is so important.</p>
<p>Here’s what we need to do, and this is what the President is focused on. We know that there are drivers to irregular migration. There are things in people’s lives that are causing them to say their only solution is to leave everything they know behind, their family, their language, their culture, their friends, their communities to make this incredibly dangerous journey and now not to be able to come into the United States. And it is a lack of effective governance. It’s the corruption that they’re dealing with in their lives. It’s profound insecurity because of violence and gangs. And maybe most fundamentally of all, it’s a lack of opportunity. It’s a lack of the ability to know that you’re going to have a job, a paycheck, the ability to put food on the table for yourself, for your family, and to build a better life.</p>
<p>So we are working in a very focused way, led by Vice President Harris on dealing with the root causes of irregular migration. We’re doing this as well in partnership with Mexico. And we know that there are answers to these problems. The Vice President, for example, recently had a call to action with our private sector to look at what it would take to make more investment in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador so that there is more opportunity. We know what needs to happen in terms of creating a better environment for investment.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, President Biden is committed to providing $4 billion over four years to work on improving the conditions. One of my colleagues last night in the meeting with SICA said that – and I thought it was very powerful – said there should be a right to remain. We have to give that meaning. We have to give meaning to the right to remain for people who – whether they’re in El Salvador or in Guatemala or Honduras or Mexico – want to make their lives and their futures at home. But the conditions make that very, very difficult. We can do something about that. It’s going to take time. It’s going to take effort. It’s going to take partnership, but we’re determined to do that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>How are you going to work with Guatemala where there is an onslaught on the independence of the judiciary by Congress – against those who fight against corruption? Honduras where the president hasn’t been accused in the U.S. but is mentioned by Department of Justice processes. His brother was convicted and sentenced for drug dealing and weapons dealing. And he, according to those documents, is part of that organization of drug dealers. And then you have El Salvador where there is also an initiative to take away independence from institutions of control. So how can you work with them if they don’t share the values that you’ve come to present?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> We will work with governments wherever we can, but we will also work with partners wherever we can. And we’ve done this before. We’ve worked directly with civil society, with NGOs, with the private sector, and all of these actors can be the effective partners that we need to actually make the assistance we’re providing meaningful, translating that into something concrete for people. And so again, for example, when it comes to building opportunity, creating investment and the jobs that flow from that, we can and we will work directly with companies. When it comes to strengthening education, we can work directly with civil society, we can work directly with communities and other individual actors.</p>
<p>So we would like to be in a position where we can work as much as possible as well directly with governments, but sometimes that’s very difficult by the choices they make. Ultimately, I believe that many leaders will come to the conclusion that what they can best offer their people is to act in a way that actually facilitates investment, partnership, engagement, and that that’s also the path to political success as well.</p>
<p>So we’re certainly going to continue to make that case. It’s something, again, that we’re also working on very closely with our partners in Mexico. We have, I think, a shared vision for building up the environment in which people really can feel secure and know that they’ll have opportunity at home. And I hope that governments in the region will do the right thing, the necessary thing in order to partner closely with us and to attract the investment that they say that they want and that they need.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> An unrelated question: Have you spoken to Foreign Minister Lavrov on this new cyber attack apparently from Russia on the meat producer that operates in the U.S., JBL, the Brazilian?</p>
<p>And does the U.S. foresee a relation with Israel without Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>Well, on the latter question, the Israelis, of course, will make their own decisions about their government as any democracy would, and we will work with any Israeli government going forward as we have in the past. President Biden has worked with every Israeli government of all parties going back to Prime Minister Golda Meir in the early 1970s. So in democracies, governments change. We’ll work with whatever government emerges, whether it’s Prime Minister Netanyahu or anyone else. So that’s (inaudible).</p>
<p>As regards Mr. Lavrov, I have not spoken to him since we saw each other a few weeks ago. Having said that, we are seeing, unfortunately, a new front in cyber threats, and that is criminal organizations using what’s called ransomware to hold hostage companies, to hold hostage critical infrastructure for financial gain. And these attacks are usually perpetrated by criminal enterprises, organizations, but they often have some physical connection, because their leaders live someplace, they’re working from someplace, and I think it’s the obligation of any country to do whatever it can to find these enterprises and to bring them to justice, including in the case of the attack on the Colonial Pipeline. The enterprise that was responsible for that attack, its leaders were in Russia, are in Russia. So I think there’s an obligation on Russia’s part to make sure that that doesn’t continue.</p>
<p>We need two things. We need to make sure that our defenses, whether it’s governments or whether it’s the private sector, are much stronger and much more effective when it comes to cyber attacks in general and so-called ransomware in particular. But we also need countries around the world to make commitments and then make good on those commitments not to harbor criminal enterprises that engage in these attacks, and on the contrary, to seek them out and to stop them and to bring them to justice.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:08 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon. It’s been a long time. Good to see everyone.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-MALDIVES"></a> Just one thing at the top. The U.S. Government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development, has airlifted emergency medical supplies to Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to help save lives, stop the spread of COVID-19, and continue to meet the urgent health needs across South Asia.</p>
<p>In Maldives, this emergency assistance will deliver – this emergency assistance delivery will provide 600 pulse oximeters and 292,000 vital pieces of personal protective equipment to support frontline healthcare workers and people most affected by the current outbreak.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, this flight will bring 1,200 pulse oximeters, and 340,000 pieces of personal protective equipment for healthcare professionals on the ground.</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, this assistance includes 880,000 vital pieces of personal protective equipment and 1,200 pulse oximeters to support frontline healthcare workers and others most affected by the current outbreak.</p>
<p>USAID is coordinating additional shipments for South Asia in the coming weeks, and we’ll have more details on that in the days and weeks ahead.</p>
<p>So with that, I am – just by habit I will start there.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m Matt today. On Iran.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. Congratulations.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-IRAN"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. On the Vienna talks, what can you tell us about the outcome of the latest round? There were signs of optimism from both the EU as well as the Iranians. Does the U.S. share that optimism that the next round could be the last?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we have tried to leave emotions aside. We are neither optimistic nor pessimistic about this. We’re clear-eyed. We’re clear-eyed about the stakes; we’re clear-eyed about our objectives. And ultimately our objective here is to ensure that Iran is once again subject to the most stringent verification and monitoring regime ever negotiated. That’s what the 2015 JCPOA imposed. That is the benefit that it accrued to us. And of course, we have been discussing indirectly with the Iranians on the ground, via our allies and partners, the modalities by which we might re-engage in mutual compliance with the terms of the 2015 JCPOA.</p>
<p>Special Envoy Malley is, I believe at this moment, on his way back to Washington. You are right that the fifth round has now concluded. We’ve always said that this will be a set of negotiations that spans multiple rounds. We expect there will be a sixth. I think there’s just about every expectation there will be subsequent rounds beyond that.</p>
<p>The fact is that we have made progress. The past rounds have helped to crystalize the choices that Iran would need to make, the steps that Iran would need to take to resume its own compliance with the nuclear deal, the steps that it would need once again to be subject to the stringent verification and monitoring regime, the limitations on heavy water, the limitations on centrifuges, the limitations that permanently – and again, verifiably – prevents Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon. And on our end too, it has helped to illuminate for us what we would need to do, including with our own sanctions, to resume our compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>
<p>This progress notwithstanding, challenges remain. And there remain questions as to whether there is a seriousness of purpose and a determination on the part of all parties to resume compliance with the deal. Again, that is a proposition the President has laid out; it was – is what we would like to see happen, given the benefits that are accrued to our national interest by ensuring that Iran is once again subject to these. But we’re not there yet and a ways ahead remains.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So after the previous round you said that it has helped crystallize, et cetera, et cetera. So what has changed in this sixth round, precisely? And would you say that there is some kind of – I don’t know if it’s a draft or a mutually agreed basis about sanctions to be lifted and actions to be taken by Iran and the only things that remains to be decided is this political decision in Tehran to sign that agreement, or there are still details on the sanctions and on the actions that have to be negotiated?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I would never want to say that what is ongoing in Vienna now is easy. And I think my colleague Rob Malley would take grave offense, as he rightly should, were I to say that. I will say what makes this – what is different about this set of negotiations versus 2014 into 2015 is the fact that we have a text, and that text, of course, is the text of the JCPOA. The fact is that we know precisely what would be required, at least generally, on all sides, because we have this text. And that text has been the – really the North Star as we have engaged indirectly with the Iranians.</p>
<p>Now even though we have a text in the form of the 2015 JCPOA, that doesn’t mean that we have all the answers. On the Iranian part, on the Iranian side, there have been now five rounds of indirect discussions about the steps they would need to take to comply, once again, with that 2015 nuclear deal. On our end, there have been discussions about sanctions that may be inconsistent with the 2015 nuclear deal, sanctions that have been imposed subsequent to the last administration’s abandonment of the JCPOA in 2018.</p>
<p>None of this is especially black and white; that’s what makes it so challenging in some ways. But again, the baseline document is that 2015 deal, both for us to determine what sanctions we may have in place currently that would be otherwise inconsistent with the deal, and what Iran would need to do on its part to resume its nuclear compliance.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You’d say that at the working level, at the Vienna talks level, there is a mutual understanding on sanctions and actions? There are still points that you disagree on?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So there is a mutual understanding as to generally what would need to happen, and at the very highest levels it’s – the shorthand is compliance for compliance. Both sides are engaging in this. I can speak for our side, presumably for the Iranian side too, because they are willing to entertain the proposition of returning to compliance.</p>
<p>Now, obviously there are some challenges that remain. There are some hurdles that remain that we haven’t been able to overcome in those five rounds. And the cause of that are – is many, including the fact that, once again, these are indirect negotiations, these are complex issues, there is no lack of distrust between and among Iran and the other partners and allies with whom we’re working on this.</p>
<p>But look, I will leave it to the Iranians to answer the question as to whether they are – they have made a strategic decision about their willingness to re-engage with the Iran deal in a way that we would need to see happen were we to resume our own compliance.</p>
<p>Said.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Verify Ned. So you’re saying you are not demanding any new provisions, that what you guys signed on to back in 2015 would suffice to get back to where things were? You’re not demanding other provisions, except maybe for the sunset clause, that’s where you might have some flexibility? Is that what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> There would be no other demands like some countries that are – like Israel, like the Saudis and so on, are calling for?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what we have said is that as a necessary but insufficient step, we are looking to return to mutual compliance. We are willing to return to compliance with the deal, knowing that, again, the benefits we would accrue from Iran doing the same would profoundly be in our own national interest. I say it’s necessary but insufficient because there are follow-on steps that we would like to see from there: a longer and stronger nuclear deal to address some of the issues that you raised, and follow-on agreements that address the broader set of threats, challenges we see from the Iranian regime – support for proxies in the region, support for terrorism and terrorist groups, its destabilizing activities, its human rights abuses.</p>
<p>So again, right now we are focused on a potential mutual return to compliance because Iran moving closer to having the capacity to quickly develop a nuclear weapon, if it so choose, would make every single challenge we face with Iran all the more difficult. We see halting Iran’s nuclear program and rolling it back in significant, deeply significant, ways as this first line of business, because it is so important.</p>
<p>Now, I will also say that just as we continue with the nuclear issue, we have remained resolutely focused on the issue of Americans who are unjustly detained in Iran. At every opportunity we raise those Americans. We have done so in the context of these talks, and we will continue to do so until and unless those Americans are safely reunited.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one more. Did Malley talk with some of the other JCPOA partners about Iranian support for Hamas?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t know that that has – what I will say is that in Vienna, Special Envoy Malley and his counterparts have been focused on the nuclear issue. Now, as I said before, we have a number of very significant concerns with Iran. Its support for proxies, its support for terrorist groups like Hamas is certainly among them, but of course Special Envoy Malley’s primary focus in Vienna has been on the nuclear issue.</p>
<p>Yeah, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What guarantees can you offer Iran that any sanctions relief you give them, if there is an accord, will not simply be undone if a Republican administration comes into office in 2024? And how do you also ensure that they see the benefits of any of that relief, given concerns in the business community also that they could still face sanctions should a successor administration undo the deal a second time?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Right. Well, look, what we know and is what the – what guided the previous Democratic administration as well and, in fact, guided previous administrations before that, is that the only way to permanently address Iran’s nuclear program, to permanently and verifiably ensure that Iran is never able to acquire a nuclear weapon, is through diplomacy.</p>
<p>And the formulation that the JCPOA struck is really, in many ways, the only formulation under the sun. It is verifiable and permanent limits on Iran’s nuclear program in return for relief of nuclear-related sanctions. Again, what we are talking about is a return to that formula, and it’s a basic formula that has been around ever since this iteration of Iran’s nuclear program has been on the table.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we can speak for this administration. We wouldn’t dare to speak for a subsequent administration. I think what we can say, however, is that this has been widely and broadly recognized not only by previous American administrations, but also by our allies – our closest allies, including those in Europe, around the world – but also partners with whom we share fairly little in terms of other mutual interests. The Russians and the Chinese, of course, are original signatories to the 2015 JCPOA because they too understand that this construction – verifiable and permanent restrictions and, in fact, a profound rollback on Iran’s nuclear program in return for limited sanctions relief – is not only in their interests, but in our estimation, it is certainly in our interests.</p>
<p>So there is an overwhelming international consensus that – on a couple fronts: Number one, that Iran’s nuclear program must not only be halted but rolled back in these important ways. And number two, that diplomacy is the way to do that on a durable and permanent basis. And number three, that this formulation, the formulation that really is quite simple in what it – in how it goes about it but is hugely meaningful in what it does for global security, that that remains on the table.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> A new topic?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let me move it around a little bit. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I have a new topic if &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah, sure. Anything else on Iran or &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one quickly on Iran.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On this follow-on agreement, is that a precondition to rejoin the JCPOA that the Iranians will commit to sitting down for this follow-on agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What is a precondition is that – before we turn to other matters – is that we have a compliance for compliance deal if that is, in fact, going to be achievable. And we certainly do hope that it will be achievable because, once again, it is in our interest to place these verifiable and permanent limits on Iran’s nuclear program by rolling back the progress that Iran has made when it comes to its nuclear program since 2018.</p>
<p>Others on &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah, I will – yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-BELARUS"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, Belarus. The – President Lukashenka’s government is now saying that they want to limit the American diplomats at the embassy. I wonder if you’re rethinking where to place U.S. Ambassador Julie Fisher. And then also, just if you have any comment on the ongoing repression because there have been some pretty gruesome scenes, especially yesterday in a courthouse in Minsk.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. Well, you are right that today, Belarus informed the United States that it is imposing new limits on American diplomatic and technical personnel at our embassy in Minsk in Belarus. This will take effect on June 13th, just a little over a week from now.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Belarusian authorities have brought our relationship to this point through relentless and intensifying repression against their citizens, culminating, of course, most recently in something we all saw – in the outrageous forced diversion of the Ryanair flight and the arrest of the Belarusian journalist and his companion who were on that flight.</p>
<p>In response to these events, and as you’ve heard from the White House in recent days, the administration announced a series of actions on May 28th late last month, including reimposing sanctions, restrictions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises previously granted relief under a general license by the Treasury Department. We know that a sovereign, independent Belarus that respects the democratic aspirations of its citizens, their human rights, and their country’s international obligations is not only in their interests; it’s in our interests as well.</p>
<p>And we’re disappointed, to put it mildly, to be where we are now, but we’ll continue to work with our allies and our partners to promote our shared interests and really not only our shared values, but universal values that remain the aspirations – the unfulfilled aspirations of the people of Belarus.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to Ambassador Fisher, it goes without saying that we, again, are a steadfast supporter of a free, independent, and democratic Belarus. Ambassador Fisher will be in a position to continue to support the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian people, and she’ll continue to engage with them from outside of Belarus, including leaders of the pro-democracy movement, media professionals, students, and other members of civil society to express our support. She’ll also continue to engage with our allies and partners, and, of course, Ambassador Fisher has been traveling in Europe in recent weeks, and I expect she will continue to do so going forward.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-BRAZIL"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’d like to ask about the vaccines, on the U.S. plan to send 25 million doses globally. Twenty-five percent will go to, quote, “countries experiencing surges, those in crisis, and other partners.” Brazil is currently experiencing a surge and a huge crisis, one of the worst. Why is Brazil not among those that will receive doses from that 25 percent? And also, are those 6 million doses that are going to Latin America and Caribbean enough to share among more than 12 countries that are doing really bad?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, let me first start by saying that the scale and the scope of the outbreak in Brazil is truly heartbreaking to see, and the United States, as we’ve said before, has and will continue to provide support to the Government of Brazil to help it recover – first staunch the outbreak and to recover from this outbreak as quickly as possible. We’ve done that in the context of non-vaccine supplies, supplies that are critical to Brazil’s health sector, public health sector. But we’re also now doing it in the context of vaccines, and Brazil is in fact receiving vaccines as a result of the announcement that came out of the White House today.</p>
<p>Before I get into that, let me just offer a bit more context as to how we think about this, because there has been a lot of attention placed on vaccines, and, of course, they’re profoundly important. But really this is a three-pronged strategy when it comes to how we seek to help the world and lead the world in stopping the pandemic, stopping it in its tracks, and putting the world back on track to recovery. The first is an emphasis that we have placed here at home on increasing our production domestically of vaccines, and that’s precisely why – our success in doing so – that we are now in a position where we are confident in our own vaccine supply, confident enough to be able to make this really ambitious and meaningful pledge of 80 million vaccines shared with the rest of the world by the end of June.</p>
<p>In parallel to that, we are also seeking to increase manufacturing capacity abroad, and we’ve spoken to that effort in a number of different contexts, including with the Quad, in the partnership that the Quad countries have developed, including in the context of India and the increased manufacturing capacity there.</p>
<p>And the third prong of this is what you asked about, and that’s the dose sharing, and that’s what we detailed a bit more today. Today, the announcement that the first 25 million doses would be going out, with 75 percent of those going to COVAX, the remaining 25 percent of that going directly to countries. And we arrived at that knowing that we set a goal of maximizing the use of multilateral mechanisms, particularly COVAX, to provide U.S. Government-owned vaccine supplies internationally. Our goal is to further strengthen these international institutions, including COVAX, which we know will continue to play a pivotal, indispensable role in helping the world to, one, stop this pandemic, and two, get back on the road to recovery.</p>
<p>Now, the 25 million doses that we spoke about today, that is only a fraction of the 80 million doses that the administration has committed to send out the door to the rest of the world by the end of this month. And as you mentioned, 75 percent will go – at least 75 percent will go through COVAX, supplying these doses to countries in need. Doing so will maximize the number of vaccines available equitably for the greatest number and for the most risk of countries around the world. And for those doses shared through COVAX, we are, in fact, prioritizing Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as South and Southeast Asia and Africa – in coordination, in that case, with the African Union. The 25 percent, we are also prioritizing a number of regions that have been especially hard hit in recent months.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to those COVAX allotment, 6 million of those doses will go to Latin America and the Caribbean, as we know that the region has suffered tremendously as other regions have as well from this pandemic.</p>
<p>And ultimately, I would just note that we’re doing this for two reasons. One, we know that as long as the virus is spreading anywhere it is a threat to people everywhere. And in order to get this virus under control, whether it is protecting against a resurgence here in this country, whether it is protecting against flareups in other countries around the world, that we need to have global coverage and a global response.</p>
<p>But two, we’re doing this because it’s the right thing to do. We have the resources now from our own increased domestic production, and this is something that it’s in – sure, it’s in the interests of the American people and of the United States, but it is the right thing to do now that we are in a position to do so. And we’ll be sharing more details on that in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-INDIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> A follow-up on these vaccines: Do you know the specific number of vaccine doses that India will receive from this 25 million?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So what we’ve spoken to today are the shares per region. And so there is a breakdown by region, but we don’t have specific dose numbers to offer per country at this point.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And when will the next round of vaccine distribution will be announced? Do you have a timeline for that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what we said – let me make one point that this 25 million – of course, not a paltry sum – will be going out the door imminently, as soon as we can muster. Now, the distribution of vaccines, of course, it depends somewhat on the manufacturer, but it is not as simple as putting a stamp on an envelope and sending it around the world. So there are logistical challenges associated with this, but we are moving as quickly as we can in an effort to get these vaccines to their destination countries as soon as we can.</p>
<p>The other part of your question is that this is 25 million. There remain some 55 million doses that the administration has committed to send abroad by the end of this month, and so I expect you’ll be hearing more from us on that in the coming days.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> These are mostly AstraZeneca, Pfizer, or Moderna? Do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So what we have said is that 60 million AstraZeneca doses. And of course, those 60 million are awaiting FDA approval, with the remaining 20 million a combination of vaccines that are available here in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I have one more on vaccine itself? As the decision was taken during the Quad to increase India’s capabilities of vaccine manufacturing, can you give us a sense where we are on that and how much time it will take for India to increase its capabilities to produce more vaccines?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, it is immensely important to us for two reasons. Number one, the increased manufacturing capacity in India, the volume of capacity that is – has potential there, has the potential to be a game changer well beyond India’s borders, and that’s precisely why this arrangement was reached and announced in the context of the Quad.</p>
<p>But two, it’s important to us because India has suffered immensely from the outbreak there. Virtually no element of Indian society has been left untouched by this horrible, horrible scourge. And so that is why we have – even before this announcement today, we have spoken of the focus on increased manufacturing in India but also the bilateral support that we have provided to India as a means to help the country address this. A hundred million dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars in total – half a billion dollars, I believe, 500 million – has been put towards this, including by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>But also, the U.S. Government, as you may recall, Secretary Blinken, Gayle Smith, Kurt Campbell and others have led an effort to galvanize the private sector to chip in and to do so in a very meaningful way, knowing that this has to be something that, if we’re going to staunch the outbreak and the epidemic there, that we will need this partnership with the private sector, and we’ve been really gratified to see that. Together between U.S. Government contributions as well as private sector contributions, we have seen some half a billion dollars in support go to India in its time of need.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I change topics?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let me just move around a little bit. Yep.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-COSTARICA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I have a couple of questions about Central America. The first one is Secretary Blinken has been earlier this week in Costa Rica, and he met with the foreign ministers of the SICA. Was there any kind of agreement or compromise after seeing the situation in the region?</p>
<p>And the second one is while Central America is supposed to be a priority for this administration, especially in terms of the fight against corruption and improving governance and institutionality, the rule of law, but the fact is that in last – last month President Bukele in San Salvador has removed the constitutional court, in Nicaragua opposition leaders has been arrested, in Guatemala the former prosecutors against corruption has been arrested. Is the United States strategy working, failing? What is happening?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, what I would say – let me first start with the second part of your question when it comes to El Salvador. And we said at the time, and we’ll reiterate now, that the actions by President Bukele and the Legislative Assembly, they undermine the independence of El Salvador&#8217;s judicial system as well as its attorney general. Secretary Blinken actually had an opportunity to speak to President Bukele shortly after these moves were announced on May 2nd. He placed a call to the president and made very clear that United States is deeply concerned by an effort to erode the separation of powers, and noting that the rule of law, anticorruption, taking aim at impunity – these are essential to a functioning democracy. And so we continue to look to President Bukele to restore strong separation of powers where they&#8217;ve been eroded and to demonstrate his government and his party&#8217;s commitment to transparency and to accountability to the people of El Salvador.</p>
<p>And now, we have – you&#8217;re right that we were just in Costa Rica for the SICA meeting, and I will tell you that the meeting focused on, in large part, at least, the patterns of irregular migration that have affected, of course, not only this country but countries in the region. But in order to – the conversation focused in large part on these very underlying issues: corruption, lack of accountability, lack of adherence to the rule of law, impunity, because these are precisely some of the most important drivers of that irregular migration.</p>
<p>And our goal ultimately is – and one of the – I will say that in the meeting, one of the participants, I think, put it quite well when he spoke of a right to remain, a right to remain for the people of Central America. And what he meant by that is that we, of course – I think much of the public focus has been on the flow of irregular migrants, but our goal needs to be – and our goal, this administration&#8217;s goal, in fact, is – to create a right to remain, the conditions so that the people of the region, the people of Central America need not feel that their only option is to undertake an incredibly dangerous and futile journey to the United States rather than remain in their home countries. And that&#8217;s really the focus of our approach. That is one of the focus of the President&#8217;s proposed $4 billion comprehensive regional strategy, to create that sense of opportunity for people of the region, to instill and to reinforce that right to remain.</p>
<p>You asked about the – some of the recent setbacks. What I would say is that this – these are challenges that won&#8217;t be solved overnight, that can&#8217;t be solved overnight. Our strategy, including the President&#8217;s $4 billion-over-four-year comprehensive vision, is one that will be developed over four years. Even in the early weeks of this administration, we&#8217;ve announced significant aid and humanitarian relief for the people of the region. Vice President Harris just within the recent days has spoken of more than $300 million that the United States is committing to address some of these challenges.</p>
<p>But again, these are these are longstanding issues: poverty, violence, corruption, extreme weather, climate change, and, of course, the two major hurricanes that hit the region in late 2020, and compounding all of that – and this is something that we talked about too – the severe economic downturn that COVID-19 has wrought on the region as well. So we have moved out, and it was an early priority of this administration on the part of Vice President Harris, on the part of Secretary Blinken, on the part of our Special Envoy Ricardo Zuniga to make progress on this and to do so in important ways. And we&#8217;ve done that.</p>
<p>But just as we do that, we know that this will be a process that will – and this will be a strategy that unfolds over time with the goal of creating better lives, creating better conditions for opportunity, and ultimately creating that right to remain for the people of Central America.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Is there any concrete outcome you are expecting from next Vice President Harris travel to Guatemala? I mean, because, okay, this is a long-term strategy, but something expected to happen now, or &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I will leave it to the White House and specifically to the Vice President’s office to speak about – to her trip. But I think just as Secretary Blinken’s travel to the SICA meeting where he met with his counterparts from the region, it will be an important signal of American engagement and our partnership with the region. And that’s really how we see this. For us, this is not just a problem to be solved; it’s a partnership. And that’s why we have made and will continue to make important investments in the future of the region, knowing that only by improving lives, only by creating that right to remain will we be able to address some of those underlying challenges.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Said.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I change topics?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yep.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. First, I want to pay tribute to our late colleague and friend, Tejinder Singh. May he rest in peace.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Thank you for that, yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-ISRAEL"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Jalina graciously did that yesterday. Second, of course, the Palestinian-Israeli issue, there is a whole smorgasbord of issues and topics that are going on there. If you care to comment on the new Israeli government or potential new Israeli government, that’s your thing, but let me ask you on two issues.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I assume you’re referring to President Herzog.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> President Herzog, you already congratulated him, but I’m talking about the government, the makeup, the new government, and how are you going to deal with Israel without Netanyahu after so many years. But let me ask you two – on two issues pertaining to the Palestinians. One – I asked this yesterday, but maybe you have more input on this today – Israel is preventing cancer patients from crossing the Erez Crossing, and it’s a really critical situation. I wonder if you have any comment on that. And my second is, of course, again, on the whereabouts of Mr. Hady Amr. What is he doing? What is next on his agenda? What is – will he be doing? Is he currently in talks, in negotiations? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yep. So on your first question, we of course are familiar with these reports, and it’s something that we document in many different contexts, including we document these concerns extensively in the West Bank and the Gaza Human Rights Report. We have encouraged all parties to work together to facilitate greater freedom of movement, including for humanitarian ends. And I can tell you, of course we were just in the region less than two weeks ago now. Deputy Assistant Secretary Amr was there; he joined up with our delegation. This absolutely was a topic of conversation with our Israeli counterparts. It was a topic of conversation with our – with the Palestinian Authority. It was something we heard from members of civil society with whom we also met.</p>
<p>The – our goal – and you’ve heard us say this now over the longer term, but it’s something we are attempting to make demonstrable progress on in the near term – is to ensure that both Israelis and Palestinians enjoy equal measures of security, of safety, of prosperity, and of dignity. And that is an important goal in its own right. It is important for the humanitarian well-being of – for – including Palestinians. But it is also important if we are going to be able to eventually make progress towards what remains our goal, and that is a two-state solution, a two-state solution that really is in our estimation the only way to preserve, importantly, Israel’s identity as a Jewish and a democratic state while bestowing on the Palestinian people their legitimate aspirations for statehood, security, and dignity.</p>
<p>And so that’s why ensuring that there is ample humanitarian assistance for the people of Gaza, especially in the aftermath of the recent violence, is incredibly important to us. It is why over the course of recent weeks, and starting before that on April 7th, right here I announced more than $100 million in support for the Palestinian people. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield just before that had announced $15 million in aid – in coronavirus-related relief for the Palestinian people. All told, I believe now we have announced some $360 million in assistance for the Palestinian people, knowing that, again, if we are to be able to help make progress towards that ultimate goal of a two-state solution, we need to provide this humanitarian relief and we need to be able to do so with some urgency, given the dire situation, especially there in Gaza in the aftermath of the violence.</p>
<p>Abbie.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-NORWAY"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks. Do you have any comment on Norway summoning the U.S. ambassador regarding spying from 2012 and 2014? And can you say what message was conveyed on behalf of the administration in that meeting?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what I would say is that the charge, as I understand it, did have a meeting with the Ministry of Defense. Look, these are issues that long predate this administration. In 2014, the Obama-Biden administration rolled out a new document – I won’t bore you with the full name, but PPD 28 – that really put a policy framework around these issues, and that administration made very clear that if we want to convey a message to our closest allies and partners, if we want to hear a message from our closest allies and partners, we’ll pick up the phone and we’ll talk to them. And that’s precisely how we view this.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On Israel.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-ISRAEL1"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any comment on this new coalition government which is trying to – well, which will have to go through a vote in the Knesset without Netanyahu? What would it change for the U.S. policy, including defense assistance to Israel? And also, do you have any worry about Netanyahu reported effort to try to undermine this transition of power or to try to stop it or prevent it in either way? And have you shared any message that you want to – Israel to keep on with its peaceful tradition of peaceful transition of power?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I think there were three or four parts to your question. I’ll answer one of them. The – regardless of what happens – and obviously, we’re not going to speak to government formation while it’s in process. Regardless of what happens, regardless of what government is in place, our stalwart support, our ironclad support for Israel will remain. You have heard from President Biden, you’ve heard from Secretary Blinken of that commitment in recent days, including when it comes to replenishment of the Iron Dome. Nothing about that will change, even if there is a change in government.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So you agree with – there is I guess a proposal for a billion dollars for replenishing the Iron Dome. I think it’s been proposed by bipartisan group of legislators, like Lindsey Graham and others and so on. You approve of that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So what &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is that happening? I mean, is that – are you doing &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What the President has said is the United States will support the replenishment of the Iron Dome. We haven’t spoken in more detail. I know there’s a proposal that has been floated, but our commitment to the Iron Dome, knowing that the Iron Dome saves untold number of Israeli lives from the indiscriminate rocket attacks fired by Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza in recent weeks – it is an indispensable tool for the safety and security of Israelis. Again, we are talking about equal measures of safety and security for Israelis and Palestinians, and on the Israeli side, the Iron Dome is an important element of that equation.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So today, the Secretary – Secretary Antony Blinken – either met or already met or is meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz. I assume that they will be discussing all these issues. Will they also be discussing a long-term quiet or truce between Gaza and Israel?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So I expect we’ll have a readout of this meeting. It took place this morning, and we’ll have a bit more detail to share. But I think what you will hear is that the meeting focused, one, on our security – on our commitment to Israel’s security, on our belief that Israel has a right to defend itself. But also I expect you will see a focus on some of the issues we’ve talked about: the humanitarian efforts to provide important humanitarian relief and assistance for the humanitarian recovery in Gaza.</p>
<p>And ultimately, we know that only if we are able to offer – again, in equal measures – a sense of opportunity, a sense of dignity, of security and democracy to Palestinians and Israelis will we able to break this cycle of violence. What we don’t want to see happen is for Gaza to be rebuilt with – in – with significant assistance from the United States and the international community only to see this occur in the coming weeks, months, or years. And so that’s why yes, we’re focused on the near term, but we’re also focused over the longer term on breaking that cycle of violence.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-KENYA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I was wondering if you have any updates on Special Envoy Feltman visit to Gulf and Kenya. And I was wondering if you are considering – if the U.S. is considering being – working on a mediation regarding the dispute over the Ethiopian Grand Dam?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, as we’ve said before, we continue to support collaborative and constructive efforts by the parties – in this case, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan – to reach an arrangement on the GERD. We understand the importance of these waters to all three countries, and we continue to encourage a resumptive – the resumption of productive dialogue on the GERD under the auspices of the AU.</p>
<p>You’re right that Ambassador Feltman is in the broader region now. I expect we’ll be able to give you more detail on his travel upon his return.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just a follow-up. Are you relying more on the African Union efforts and ideas regarding the dispute over the Grand Dam?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we know that the African Union is an important forum for conflict resolution, for mediation. We see ourselves as a partner not only to these three countries, but also to the African Union. And so we’re working very closely with the African Union in an effort to bring the parties together and to make meaningful progress towards a resolution of this dispute.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-AFGHANISTAN"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On Afghanistan, there’s a new UN report today that says the Taliban remains close with al-Qaida; despite efforts to mask their ties, they still have a close connection. Given the unconditional withdrawal of U.S. troops, what’s to stop Afghanistan from falling to the Taliban, to becoming a haven for terrorism after the U.S. withdrawal? And do you have any update on efforts to get SIV applicants out of the country?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, on your first question, we are – we absolutely have not taken our eye off the terrorist threat, far from it. And as we have said in the context of announcing our – the military withdrawal from Afghanistan, we will have the means to detect a re-emergence of a terrorist threat to the homeland from Afghanistan, and to take action should that occur. We’re going to reposition our forces and our assets to make sure that we guard against this potential re-emergence, and we’ve spoken of the over-the-horizon options.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the Taliban committed not to allow al-Qaida or other terrorists to threaten the security of the United States or our allies from Afghan soil. We are going to hold them to that commitment. Our ultimate goal is an Afghanistan that finds an end to four decades of conflict through a just and durable political settlement. And in that situation, in that environment, terrorism is less likely to emerge. That’s why we continue to support the peace process and to encourage the parties to come together. And we were heartened to see in recent days that the negotiating teams are returning to Doha, and we’ve urged them to focus on the key issues surrounding a political settlement and permanent, comprehensive ceasefire. We know that this is a really pivotal moment for Afghan leaders and the Taliban to come together and to take responsibility for the future of the country.</p>
<p>We’re also committed to the peace process because of the knowledge that the world will not accept in Afghanistan – the world will not accept the establishment in Afghanistan of any government imposed by force. That’s why our focus is on diplomacy. That’s why we’re heartened to see the parties coming back together in Doha.</p>
<p>When it comes to SIVs, we’ve said this before, but we understand and we recognize that we have a special commitment and a special responsibility to the many Afghans who, over the years, have at great risk to themselves and even to their families – have assisted the United States in our efforts in Afghanistan. We are always seeking ways to improve the SIV process while ensuring the integrity of the program and safeguarding our national security and affording opportunities to these Afghans.</p>
<p>We’ve identified process improvements and directed additional resources to the program, including augmenting staff here in Washington to process applications. It’s – and I mention that because it’s worth noting that much of the processing of applicants at the chief of mission stage occurs not in Kabul but here in Washington. And the team has significantly increased its staffing in recent months. We’ve also approved a temporary increase in consular staffing at our embassy in Kabul to conduct interviews and to process visa applications, which allowed the embassy to address cases that were delayed due to COVID-19 staffing reductions and related closures.</p>
<p>You also heard last week, I believe it was our deputy secretary for management and resources, in speaking to the budget, that we have requested an additional 8,000 SIV funding for – an additional 8,000 Special Immigrant Visas from Congress. And of course, we know that it’s not only the department, it’s not only the Executive Branch that is deeply, deeply committed to this program, but again, we are heartened to know that we have a partner in Congress, and a Congress that is very focused, just as we are on this program as well.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just follow up on that? Is there – are there any plans for evacuating people or doing this processing in a third country where it’s safer?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So what’s important – and again, I think it’s important to understand is that even as we withdraw militarily, our commitment to the government, and in this case, the people of Afghanistan will remain; our diplomatic facility in Kabul will, even after the September deadline for troops to be – U.S. military forces to be out of the country, our embassy will remain, will be able to continue processing. And we will do that as quickly and efficiently as we can, knowing, again, the special responsibility that we have to these brave Afghans.</p>
<p>Thank you. We’ll do one more.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-BURMA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. A court in Myanmar on Wednesday jailed two journalists for incitement and spreading false news, their organizations said. What’s the U.S. doing to secure their release, and has anyone been able to visit them?</p>
<p>And if I may, EU’s Foreign Affair Chief Borrell said today that the EU will impose a new round of sanctions on Myanmar’s military junta and its economic interests in the coming days. Will the – is the U.S. planning a coordinated announcement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, you didn’t ask about this precisely, but let me also take an opportunity to note that we are deeply concerned over the detention of U.S. citizens Daniel Fenster and Nathan Maung, both of whom were working as journalists in Burma. We’ve pressed the military regime to release them both immediately – to release both of them immediately. And we’ll continue to do so until they are allowed to return safely to their families.</p>
<p>And this gets to your broader question. Free and independent media is indispensable to building prosperous, resilient, and free societies. We have seen the junta in recent days attempt to stifle freedom of expression, freedom of assembly. And they do that knowing that only by suppressing the will of the Burmese people might they be able to retain some semblance of control. And so we will continue to press for the release of journalists who are detained in Burma. We will continue to press for the release of these two Americans. Our consular officers most recently conducted a virtual visit with Nathan Maung on May 24th. We have also sought to visit Daniel Fenster, but we haven’t been afforded access to him by regime officials.</p>
<p>So as we attempt to ensure the secure – the freedom of these journalists, we will be pressing the case for all journalists who are wrongfully detained in Burma for doing nothing more than their job, and ultimately knowing that their job is the – protecting the freedom of expression in – of the people of Burma.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So super quick &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-BRAZIL1"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you know how many doses are going to Brazil? Brazilian Government is saying 2 million. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So the announcement today was grouped by region, and we spoke of broad allocations to regions. There were, I believe, 6 million doses going to the region. But we haven’t spoken in terms of allocations to countries.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Thank you all very much.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 3:05 p.m.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:08 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon. It’s been a long time. Good to see everyone.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-MALDIVES"></a> Just one thing at the top. The U.S. Government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development, has airlifted emergency medical supplies to Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to help save lives, stop the spread of COVID-19, and continue to meet the urgent health needs across South Asia.</p>
<p>In Maldives, this emergency assistance will deliver – this emergency assistance delivery will provide 600 pulse oximeters and 292,000 vital pieces of personal protective equipment to support frontline healthcare workers and people most affected by the current outbreak.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, this flight will bring 1,200 pulse oximeters, and 340,000 pieces of personal protective equipment for healthcare professionals on the ground.</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, this assistance includes 880,000 vital pieces of personal protective equipment and 1,200 pulse oximeters to support frontline healthcare workers and others most affected by the current outbreak.</p>
<p>USAID is coordinating additional shipments for South Asia in the coming weeks, and we’ll have more details on that in the days and weeks ahead.</p>
<p>So with that, I am – just by habit I will start there.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m Matt today. On Iran.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. Congratulations.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-IRAN"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. On the Vienna talks, what can you tell us about the outcome of the latest round? There were signs of optimism from both the EU as well as the Iranians. Does the U.S. share that optimism that the next round could be the last?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we have tried to leave emotions aside. We are neither optimistic nor pessimistic about this. We’re clear-eyed. We’re clear-eyed about the stakes; we’re clear-eyed about our objectives. And ultimately our objective here is to ensure that Iran is once again subject to the most stringent verification and monitoring regime ever negotiated. That’s what the 2015 JCPOA imposed. That is the benefit that it accrued to us. And of course, we have been discussing indirectly with the Iranians on the ground, via our allies and partners, the modalities by which we might re-engage in mutual compliance with the terms of the 2015 JCPOA.</p>
<p>Special Envoy Malley is, I believe at this moment, on his way back to Washington. You are right that the fifth round has now concluded. We’ve always said that this will be a set of negotiations that spans multiple rounds. We expect there will be a sixth. I think there’s just about every expectation there will be subsequent rounds beyond that.</p>
<p>The fact is that we have made progress. The past rounds have helped to crystalize the choices that Iran would need to make, the steps that Iran would need to take to resume its own compliance with the nuclear deal, the steps that it would need once again to be subject to the stringent verification and monitoring regime, the limitations on heavy water, the limitations on centrifuges, the limitations that permanently – and again, verifiably – prevents Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon. And on our end too, it has helped to illuminate for us what we would need to do, including with our own sanctions, to resume our compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>
<p>This progress notwithstanding, challenges remain. And there remain questions as to whether there is a seriousness of purpose and a determination on the part of all parties to resume compliance with the deal. Again, that is a proposition the President has laid out; it was – is what we would like to see happen, given the benefits that are accrued to our national interest by ensuring that Iran is once again subject to these. But we’re not there yet and a ways ahead remains.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So after the previous round you said that it has helped crystallize, et cetera, et cetera. So what has changed in this sixth round, precisely? And would you say that there is some kind of – I don’t know if it’s a draft or a mutually agreed basis about sanctions to be lifted and actions to be taken by Iran and the only things that remains to be decided is this political decision in Tehran to sign that agreement, or there are still details on the sanctions and on the actions that have to be negotiated?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I would never want to say that what is ongoing in Vienna now is easy. And I think my colleague Rob Malley would take grave offense, as he rightly should, were I to say that. I will say what makes this – what is different about this set of negotiations versus 2014 into 2015 is the fact that we have a text, and that text, of course, is the text of the JCPOA. The fact is that we know precisely what would be required, at least generally, on all sides, because we have this text. And that text has been the – really the North Star as we have engaged indirectly with the Iranians.</p>
<p>Now even though we have a text in the form of the 2015 JCPOA, that doesn’t mean that we have all the answers. On the Iranian part, on the Iranian side, there have been now five rounds of indirect discussions about the steps they would need to take to comply, once again, with that 2015 nuclear deal. On our end, there have been discussions about sanctions that may be inconsistent with the 2015 nuclear deal, sanctions that have been imposed subsequent to the last administration’s abandonment of the JCPOA in 2018.</p>
<p>None of this is especially black and white; that’s what makes it so challenging in some ways. But again, the baseline document is that 2015 deal, both for us to determine what sanctions we may have in place currently that would be otherwise inconsistent with the deal, and what Iran would need to do on its part to resume its nuclear compliance.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You’d say that at the working level, at the Vienna talks level, there is a mutual understanding on sanctions and actions? There are still points that you disagree on?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So there is a mutual understanding as to generally what would need to happen, and at the very highest levels it’s – the shorthand is compliance for compliance. Both sides are engaging in this. I can speak for our side, presumably for the Iranian side too, because they are willing to entertain the proposition of returning to compliance.</p>
<p>Now, obviously there are some challenges that remain. There are some hurdles that remain that we haven’t been able to overcome in those five rounds. And the cause of that are – is many, including the fact that, once again, these are indirect negotiations, these are complex issues, there is no lack of distrust between and among Iran and the other partners and allies with whom we’re working on this.</p>
<p>But look, I will leave it to the Iranians to answer the question as to whether they are – they have made a strategic decision about their willingness to re-engage with the Iran deal in a way that we would need to see happen were we to resume our own compliance.</p>
<p>Said.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Verify Ned. So you’re saying you are not demanding any new provisions, that what you guys signed on to back in 2015 would suffice to get back to where things were? You’re not demanding other provisions, except maybe for the sunset clause, that’s where you might have some flexibility? Is that what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> There would be no other demands like some countries that are – like Israel, like the Saudis and so on, are calling for?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what we have said is that as a necessary but insufficient step, we are looking to return to mutual compliance. We are willing to return to compliance with the deal, knowing that, again, the benefits we would accrue from Iran doing the same would profoundly be in our own national interest. I say it’s necessary but insufficient because there are follow-on steps that we would like to see from there: a longer and stronger nuclear deal to address some of the issues that you raised, and follow-on agreements that address the broader set of threats, challenges we see from the Iranian regime – support for proxies in the region, support for terrorism and terrorist groups, its destabilizing activities, its human rights abuses.</p>
<p>So again, right now we are focused on a potential mutual return to compliance because Iran moving closer to having the capacity to quickly develop a nuclear weapon, if it so choose, would make every single challenge we face with Iran all the more difficult. We see halting Iran’s nuclear program and rolling it back in significant, deeply significant, ways as this first line of business, because it is so important.</p>
<p>Now, I will also say that just as we continue with the nuclear issue, we have remained resolutely focused on the issue of Americans who are unjustly detained in Iran. At every opportunity we raise those Americans. We have done so in the context of these talks, and we will continue to do so until and unless those Americans are safely reunited.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one more. Did Malley talk with some of the other JCPOA partners about Iranian support for Hamas?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t know that that has – what I will say is that in Vienna, Special Envoy Malley and his counterparts have been focused on the nuclear issue. Now, as I said before, we have a number of very significant concerns with Iran. Its support for proxies, its support for terrorist groups like Hamas is certainly among them, but of course Special Envoy Malley’s primary focus in Vienna has been on the nuclear issue.</p>
<p>Yeah, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What guarantees can you offer Iran that any sanctions relief you give them, if there is an accord, will not simply be undone if a Republican administration comes into office in 2024? And how do you also ensure that they see the benefits of any of that relief, given concerns in the business community also that they could still face sanctions should a successor administration undo the deal a second time?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Right. Well, look, what we know and is what the – what guided the previous Democratic administration as well and, in fact, guided previous administrations before that, is that the only way to permanently address Iran’s nuclear program, to permanently and verifiably ensure that Iran is never able to acquire a nuclear weapon, is through diplomacy.</p>
<p>And the formulation that the JCPOA struck is really, in many ways, the only formulation under the sun. It is verifiable and permanent limits on Iran’s nuclear program in return for relief of nuclear-related sanctions. Again, what we are talking about is a return to that formula, and it’s a basic formula that has been around ever since this iteration of Iran’s nuclear program has been on the table.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we can speak for this administration. We wouldn’t dare to speak for a subsequent administration. I think what we can say, however, is that this has been widely and broadly recognized not only by previous American administrations, but also by our allies – our closest allies, including those in Europe, around the world – but also partners with whom we share fairly little in terms of other mutual interests. The Russians and the Chinese, of course, are original signatories to the 2015 JCPOA because they too understand that this construction – verifiable and permanent restrictions and, in fact, a profound rollback on Iran’s nuclear program in return for limited sanctions relief – is not only in their interests, but in our estimation, it is certainly in our interests.</p>
<p>So there is an overwhelming international consensus that – on a couple fronts: Number one, that Iran’s nuclear program must not only be halted but rolled back in these important ways. And number two, that diplomacy is the way to do that on a durable and permanent basis. And number three, that this formulation, the formulation that really is quite simple in what it – in how it goes about it but is hugely meaningful in what it does for global security, that that remains on the table.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> A new topic?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let me move it around a little bit. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I have a new topic if &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah, sure. Anything else on Iran or &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one quickly on Iran.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On this follow-on agreement, is that a precondition to rejoin the JCPOA that the Iranians will commit to sitting down for this follow-on agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What is a precondition is that – before we turn to other matters – is that we have a compliance for compliance deal if that is, in fact, going to be achievable. And we certainly do hope that it will be achievable because, once again, it is in our interest to place these verifiable and permanent limits on Iran’s nuclear program by rolling back the progress that Iran has made when it comes to its nuclear program since 2018.</p>
<p>Others on &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah, I will – yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-BELARUS"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, Belarus. The – President Lukashenka’s government is now saying that they want to limit the American diplomats at the embassy. I wonder if you’re rethinking where to place U.S. Ambassador Julie Fisher. And then also, just if you have any comment on the ongoing repression because there have been some pretty gruesome scenes, especially yesterday in a courthouse in Minsk.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. Well, you are right that today, Belarus informed the United States that it is imposing new limits on American diplomatic and technical personnel at our embassy in Minsk in Belarus. This will take effect on June 13th, just a little over a week from now.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Belarusian authorities have brought our relationship to this point through relentless and intensifying repression against their citizens, culminating, of course, most recently in something we all saw – in the outrageous forced diversion of the Ryanair flight and the arrest of the Belarusian journalist and his companion who were on that flight.</p>
<p>In response to these events, and as you’ve heard from the White House in recent days, the administration announced a series of actions on May 28th late last month, including reimposing sanctions, restrictions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises previously granted relief under a general license by the Treasury Department. We know that a sovereign, independent Belarus that respects the democratic aspirations of its citizens, their human rights, and their country’s international obligations is not only in their interests; it’s in our interests as well.</p>
<p>And we’re disappointed, to put it mildly, to be where we are now, but we’ll continue to work with our allies and our partners to promote our shared interests and really not only our shared values, but universal values that remain the aspirations – the unfulfilled aspirations of the people of Belarus.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to Ambassador Fisher, it goes without saying that we, again, are a steadfast supporter of a free, independent, and democratic Belarus. Ambassador Fisher will be in a position to continue to support the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian people, and she’ll continue to engage with them from outside of Belarus, including leaders of the pro-democracy movement, media professionals, students, and other members of civil society to express our support. She’ll also continue to engage with our allies and partners, and, of course, Ambassador Fisher has been traveling in Europe in recent weeks, and I expect she will continue to do so going forward.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-BRAZIL"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’d like to ask about the vaccines, on the U.S. plan to send 25 million doses globally. Twenty-five percent will go to, quote, “countries experiencing surges, those in crisis, and other partners.” Brazil is currently experiencing a surge and a huge crisis, one of the worst. Why is Brazil not among those that will receive doses from that 25 percent? And also, are those 6 million doses that are going to Latin America and Caribbean enough to share among more than 12 countries that are doing really bad?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, let me first start by saying that the scale and the scope of the outbreak in Brazil is truly heartbreaking to see, and the United States, as we’ve said before, has and will continue to provide support to the Government of Brazil to help it recover – first staunch the outbreak and to recover from this outbreak as quickly as possible. We’ve done that in the context of non-vaccine supplies, supplies that are critical to Brazil’s health sector, public health sector. But we’re also now doing it in the context of vaccines, and Brazil is in fact receiving vaccines as a result of the announcement that came out of the White House today.</p>
<p>Before I get into that, let me just offer a bit more context as to how we think about this, because there has been a lot of attention placed on vaccines, and, of course, they’re profoundly important. But really this is a three-pronged strategy when it comes to how we seek to help the world and lead the world in stopping the pandemic, stopping it in its tracks, and putting the world back on track to recovery. The first is an emphasis that we have placed here at home on increasing our production domestically of vaccines, and that’s precisely why – our success in doing so – that we are now in a position where we are confident in our own vaccine supply, confident enough to be able to make this really ambitious and meaningful pledge of 80 million vaccines shared with the rest of the world by the end of June.</p>
<p>In parallel to that, we are also seeking to increase manufacturing capacity abroad, and we’ve spoken to that effort in a number of different contexts, including with the Quad, in the partnership that the Quad countries have developed, including in the context of India and the increased manufacturing capacity there.</p>
<p>And the third prong of this is what you asked about, and that’s the dose sharing, and that’s what we detailed a bit more today. Today, the announcement that the first 25 million doses would be going out, with 75 percent of those going to COVAX, the remaining 25 percent of that going directly to countries. And we arrived at that knowing that we set a goal of maximizing the use of multilateral mechanisms, particularly COVAX, to provide U.S. Government-owned vaccine supplies internationally. Our goal is to further strengthen these international institutions, including COVAX, which we know will continue to play a pivotal, indispensable role in helping the world to, one, stop this pandemic, and two, get back on the road to recovery.</p>
<p>Now, the 25 million doses that we spoke about today, that is only a fraction of the 80 million doses that the administration has committed to send out the door to the rest of the world by the end of this month. And as you mentioned, 75 percent will go – at least 75 percent will go through COVAX, supplying these doses to countries in need. Doing so will maximize the number of vaccines available equitably for the greatest number and for the most risk of countries around the world. And for those doses shared through COVAX, we are, in fact, prioritizing Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as South and Southeast Asia and Africa – in coordination, in that case, with the African Union. The 25 percent, we are also prioritizing a number of regions that have been especially hard hit in recent months.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to those COVAX allotment, 6 million of those doses will go to Latin America and the Caribbean, as we know that the region has suffered tremendously as other regions have as well from this pandemic.</p>
<p>And ultimately, I would just note that we’re doing this for two reasons. One, we know that as long as the virus is spreading anywhere it is a threat to people everywhere. And in order to get this virus under control, whether it is protecting against a resurgence here in this country, whether it is protecting against flareups in other countries around the world, that we need to have global coverage and a global response.</p>
<p>But two, we’re doing this because it’s the right thing to do. We have the resources now from our own increased domestic production, and this is something that it’s in – sure, it’s in the interests of the American people and of the United States, but it is the right thing to do now that we are in a position to do so. And we’ll be sharing more details on that in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-INDIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> A follow-up on these vaccines: Do you know the specific number of vaccine doses that India will receive from this 25 million?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So what we’ve spoken to today are the shares per region. And so there is a breakdown by region, but we don’t have specific dose numbers to offer per country at this point.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And when will the next round of vaccine distribution will be announced? Do you have a timeline for that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what we said – let me make one point that this 25 million – of course, not a paltry sum – will be going out the door imminently, as soon as we can muster. Now, the distribution of vaccines, of course, it depends somewhat on the manufacturer, but it is not as simple as putting a stamp on an envelope and sending it around the world. So there are logistical challenges associated with this, but we are moving as quickly as we can in an effort to get these vaccines to their destination countries as soon as we can.</p>
<p>The other part of your question is that this is 25 million. There remain some 55 million doses that the administration has committed to send abroad by the end of this month, and so I expect you’ll be hearing more from us on that in the coming days.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> These are mostly AstraZeneca, Pfizer, or Moderna? Do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So what we have said is that 60 million AstraZeneca doses. And of course, those 60 million are awaiting FDA approval, with the remaining 20 million a combination of vaccines that are available here in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I have one more on vaccine itself? As the decision was taken during the Quad to increase India’s capabilities of vaccine manufacturing, can you give us a sense where we are on that and how much time it will take for India to increase its capabilities to produce more vaccines?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, it is immensely important to us for two reasons. Number one, the increased manufacturing capacity in India, the volume of capacity that is – has potential there, has the potential to be a game changer well beyond India’s borders, and that’s precisely why this arrangement was reached and announced in the context of the Quad.</p>
<p>But two, it’s important to us because India has suffered immensely from the outbreak there. Virtually no element of Indian society has been left untouched by this horrible, horrible scourge. And so that is why we have – even before this announcement today, we have spoken of the focus on increased manufacturing in India but also the bilateral support that we have provided to India as a means to help the country address this. A hundred million dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars in total – half a billion dollars, I believe, 500 million – has been put towards this, including by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>But also, the U.S. Government, as you may recall, Secretary Blinken, Gayle Smith, Kurt Campbell and others have led an effort to galvanize the private sector to chip in and to do so in a very meaningful way, knowing that this has to be something that, if we’re going to staunch the outbreak and the epidemic there, that we will need this partnership with the private sector, and we’ve been really gratified to see that. Together between U.S. Government contributions as well as private sector contributions, we have seen some half a billion dollars in support go to India in its time of need.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I change topics?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let me just move around a little bit. Yep.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-COSTARICA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I have a couple of questions about Central America. The first one is Secretary Blinken has been earlier this week in Costa Rica, and he met with the foreign ministers of the SICA. Was there any kind of agreement or compromise after seeing the situation in the region?</p>
<p>And the second one is while Central America is supposed to be a priority for this administration, especially in terms of the fight against corruption and improving governance and institutionality, the rule of law, but the fact is that in last – last month President Bukele in San Salvador has removed the constitutional court, in Nicaragua opposition leaders has been arrested, in Guatemala the former prosecutors against corruption has been arrested. Is the United States strategy working, failing? What is happening?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, what I would say – let me first start with the second part of your question when it comes to El Salvador. And we said at the time, and we’ll reiterate now, that the actions by President Bukele and the Legislative Assembly, they undermine the independence of El Salvador&#8217;s judicial system as well as its attorney general. Secretary Blinken actually had an opportunity to speak to President Bukele shortly after these moves were announced on May 2nd. He placed a call to the president and made very clear that United States is deeply concerned by an effort to erode the separation of powers, and noting that the rule of law, anticorruption, taking aim at impunity – these are essential to a functioning democracy. And so we continue to look to President Bukele to restore strong separation of powers where they&#8217;ve been eroded and to demonstrate his government and his party&#8217;s commitment to transparency and to accountability to the people of El Salvador.</p>
<p>And now, we have – you&#8217;re right that we were just in Costa Rica for the SICA meeting, and I will tell you that the meeting focused on, in large part, at least, the patterns of irregular migration that have affected, of course, not only this country but countries in the region. But in order to – the conversation focused in large part on these very underlying issues: corruption, lack of accountability, lack of adherence to the rule of law, impunity, because these are precisely some of the most important drivers of that irregular migration.</p>
<p>And our goal ultimately is – and one of the – I will say that in the meeting, one of the participants, I think, put it quite well when he spoke of a right to remain, a right to remain for the people of Central America. And what he meant by that is that we, of course – I think much of the public focus has been on the flow of irregular migrants, but our goal needs to be – and our goal, this administration&#8217;s goal, in fact, is – to create a right to remain, the conditions so that the people of the region, the people of Central America need not feel that their only option is to undertake an incredibly dangerous and futile journey to the United States rather than remain in their home countries. And that&#8217;s really the focus of our approach. That is one of the focus of the President&#8217;s proposed $4 billion comprehensive regional strategy, to create that sense of opportunity for people of the region, to instill and to reinforce that right to remain.</p>
<p>You asked about the – some of the recent setbacks. What I would say is that this – these are challenges that won&#8217;t be solved overnight, that can&#8217;t be solved overnight. Our strategy, including the President&#8217;s $4 billion-over-four-year comprehensive vision, is one that will be developed over four years. Even in the early weeks of this administration, we&#8217;ve announced significant aid and humanitarian relief for the people of the region. Vice President Harris just within the recent days has spoken of more than $300 million that the United States is committing to address some of these challenges.</p>
<p>But again, these are these are longstanding issues: poverty, violence, corruption, extreme weather, climate change, and, of course, the two major hurricanes that hit the region in late 2020, and compounding all of that – and this is something that we talked about too – the severe economic downturn that COVID-19 has wrought on the region as well. So we have moved out, and it was an early priority of this administration on the part of Vice President Harris, on the part of Secretary Blinken, on the part of our Special Envoy Ricardo Zuniga to make progress on this and to do so in important ways. And we&#8217;ve done that.</p>
<p>But just as we do that, we know that this will be a process that will – and this will be a strategy that unfolds over time with the goal of creating better lives, creating better conditions for opportunity, and ultimately creating that right to remain for the people of Central America.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Is there any concrete outcome you are expecting from next Vice President Harris travel to Guatemala? I mean, because, okay, this is a long-term strategy, but something expected to happen now, or &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I will leave it to the White House and specifically to the Vice President’s office to speak about – to her trip. But I think just as Secretary Blinken’s travel to the SICA meeting where he met with his counterparts from the region, it will be an important signal of American engagement and our partnership with the region. And that’s really how we see this. For us, this is not just a problem to be solved; it’s a partnership. And that’s why we have made and will continue to make important investments in the future of the region, knowing that only by improving lives, only by creating that right to remain will we be able to address some of those underlying challenges.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Said.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I change topics?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yep.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. First, I want to pay tribute to our late colleague and friend, Tejinder Singh. May he rest in peace.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Thank you for that, yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-ISRAEL"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Jalina graciously did that yesterday. Second, of course, the Palestinian-Israeli issue, there is a whole smorgasbord of issues and topics that are going on there. If you care to comment on the new Israeli government or potential new Israeli government, that’s your thing, but let me ask you on two issues.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I assume you’re referring to President Herzog.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> President Herzog, you already congratulated him, but I’m talking about the government, the makeup, the new government, and how are you going to deal with Israel without Netanyahu after so many years. But let me ask you two – on two issues pertaining to the Palestinians. One – I asked this yesterday, but maybe you have more input on this today – Israel is preventing cancer patients from crossing the Erez Crossing, and it’s a really critical situation. I wonder if you have any comment on that. And my second is, of course, again, on the whereabouts of Mr. Hady Amr. What is he doing? What is next on his agenda? What is – will he be doing? Is he currently in talks, in negotiations? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yep. So on your first question, we of course are familiar with these reports, and it’s something that we document in many different contexts, including we document these concerns extensively in the West Bank and the Gaza Human Rights Report. We have encouraged all parties to work together to facilitate greater freedom of movement, including for humanitarian ends. And I can tell you, of course we were just in the region less than two weeks ago now. Deputy Assistant Secretary Amr was there; he joined up with our delegation. This absolutely was a topic of conversation with our Israeli counterparts. It was a topic of conversation with our – with the Palestinian Authority. It was something we heard from members of civil society with whom we also met.</p>
<p>The – our goal – and you’ve heard us say this now over the longer term, but it’s something we are attempting to make demonstrable progress on in the near term – is to ensure that both Israelis and Palestinians enjoy equal measures of security, of safety, of prosperity, and of dignity. And that is an important goal in its own right. It is important for the humanitarian well-being of – for – including Palestinians. But it is also important if we are going to be able to eventually make progress towards what remains our goal, and that is a two-state solution, a two-state solution that really is in our estimation the only way to preserve, importantly, Israel’s identity as a Jewish and a democratic state while bestowing on the Palestinian people their legitimate aspirations for statehood, security, and dignity.</p>
<p>And so that’s why ensuring that there is ample humanitarian assistance for the people of Gaza, especially in the aftermath of the recent violence, is incredibly important to us. It is why over the course of recent weeks, and starting before that on April 7th, right here I announced more than $100 million in support for the Palestinian people. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield just before that had announced $15 million in aid – in coronavirus-related relief for the Palestinian people. All told, I believe now we have announced some $360 million in assistance for the Palestinian people, knowing that, again, if we are to be able to help make progress towards that ultimate goal of a two-state solution, we need to provide this humanitarian relief and we need to be able to do so with some urgency, given the dire situation, especially there in Gaza in the aftermath of the violence.</p>
<p>Abbie.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-NORWAY"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks. Do you have any comment on Norway summoning the U.S. ambassador regarding spying from 2012 and 2014? And can you say what message was conveyed on behalf of the administration in that meeting?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what I would say is that the charge, as I understand it, did have a meeting with the Ministry of Defense. Look, these are issues that long predate this administration. In 2014, the Obama-Biden administration rolled out a new document – I won’t bore you with the full name, but PPD 28 – that really put a policy framework around these issues, and that administration made very clear that if we want to convey a message to our closest allies and partners, if we want to hear a message from our closest allies and partners, we’ll pick up the phone and we’ll talk to them. And that’s precisely how we view this.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On Israel.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-ISRAEL1"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any comment on this new coalition government which is trying to – well, which will have to go through a vote in the Knesset without Netanyahu? What would it change for the U.S. policy, including defense assistance to Israel? And also, do you have any worry about Netanyahu reported effort to try to undermine this transition of power or to try to stop it or prevent it in either way? And have you shared any message that you want to – Israel to keep on with its peaceful tradition of peaceful transition of power?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I think there were three or four parts to your question. I’ll answer one of them. The – regardless of what happens – and obviously, we’re not going to speak to government formation while it’s in process. Regardless of what happens, regardless of what government is in place, our stalwart support, our ironclad support for Israel will remain. You have heard from President Biden, you’ve heard from Secretary Blinken of that commitment in recent days, including when it comes to replenishment of the Iron Dome. Nothing about that will change, even if there is a change in government.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So you agree with – there is I guess a proposal for a billion dollars for replenishing the Iron Dome. I think it’s been proposed by bipartisan group of legislators, like Lindsey Graham and others and so on. You approve of that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So what &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is that happening? I mean, is that – are you doing &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What the President has said is the United States will support the replenishment of the Iron Dome. We haven’t spoken in more detail. I know there’s a proposal that has been floated, but our commitment to the Iron Dome, knowing that the Iron Dome saves untold number of Israeli lives from the indiscriminate rocket attacks fired by Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza in recent weeks – it is an indispensable tool for the safety and security of Israelis. Again, we are talking about equal measures of safety and security for Israelis and Palestinians, and on the Israeli side, the Iron Dome is an important element of that equation.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So today, the Secretary – Secretary Antony Blinken – either met or already met or is meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz. I assume that they will be discussing all these issues. Will they also be discussing a long-term quiet or truce between Gaza and Israel?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So I expect we’ll have a readout of this meeting. It took place this morning, and we’ll have a bit more detail to share. But I think what you will hear is that the meeting focused, one, on our security – on our commitment to Israel’s security, on our belief that Israel has a right to defend itself. But also I expect you will see a focus on some of the issues we’ve talked about: the humanitarian efforts to provide important humanitarian relief and assistance for the humanitarian recovery in Gaza.</p>
<p>And ultimately, we know that only if we are able to offer – again, in equal measures – a sense of opportunity, a sense of dignity, of security and democracy to Palestinians and Israelis will we able to break this cycle of violence. What we don’t want to see happen is for Gaza to be rebuilt with – in – with significant assistance from the United States and the international community only to see this occur in the coming weeks, months, or years. And so that’s why yes, we’re focused on the near term, but we’re also focused over the longer term on breaking that cycle of violence.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-KENYA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I was wondering if you have any updates on Special Envoy Feltman visit to Gulf and Kenya. And I was wondering if you are considering – if the U.S. is considering being – working on a mediation regarding the dispute over the Ethiopian Grand Dam?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, as we’ve said before, we continue to support collaborative and constructive efforts by the parties – in this case, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan – to reach an arrangement on the GERD. We understand the importance of these waters to all three countries, and we continue to encourage a resumptive – the resumption of productive dialogue on the GERD under the auspices of the AU.</p>
<p>You’re right that Ambassador Feltman is in the broader region now. I expect we’ll be able to give you more detail on his travel upon his return.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just a follow-up. Are you relying more on the African Union efforts and ideas regarding the dispute over the Grand Dam?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we know that the African Union is an important forum for conflict resolution, for mediation. We see ourselves as a partner not only to these three countries, but also to the African Union. And so we’re working very closely with the African Union in an effort to bring the parties together and to make meaningful progress towards a resolution of this dispute.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-AFGHANISTAN"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On Afghanistan, there’s a new UN report today that says the Taliban remains close with al-Qaida; despite efforts to mask their ties, they still have a close connection. Given the unconditional withdrawal of U.S. troops, what’s to stop Afghanistan from falling to the Taliban, to becoming a haven for terrorism after the U.S. withdrawal? And do you have any update on efforts to get SIV applicants out of the country?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, on your first question, we are – we absolutely have not taken our eye off the terrorist threat, far from it. And as we have said in the context of announcing our – the military withdrawal from Afghanistan, we will have the means to detect a re-emergence of a terrorist threat to the homeland from Afghanistan, and to take action should that occur. We’re going to reposition our forces and our assets to make sure that we guard against this potential re-emergence, and we’ve spoken of the over-the-horizon options.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the Taliban committed not to allow al-Qaida or other terrorists to threaten the security of the United States or our allies from Afghan soil. We are going to hold them to that commitment. Our ultimate goal is an Afghanistan that finds an end to four decades of conflict through a just and durable political settlement. And in that situation, in that environment, terrorism is less likely to emerge. That’s why we continue to support the peace process and to encourage the parties to come together. And we were heartened to see in recent days that the negotiating teams are returning to Doha, and we’ve urged them to focus on the key issues surrounding a political settlement and permanent, comprehensive ceasefire. We know that this is a really pivotal moment for Afghan leaders and the Taliban to come together and to take responsibility for the future of the country.</p>
<p>We’re also committed to the peace process because of the knowledge that the world will not accept in Afghanistan – the world will not accept the establishment in Afghanistan of any government imposed by force. That’s why our focus is on diplomacy. That’s why we’re heartened to see the parties coming back together in Doha.</p>
<p>When it comes to SIVs, we’ve said this before, but we understand and we recognize that we have a special commitment and a special responsibility to the many Afghans who, over the years, have at great risk to themselves and even to their families – have assisted the United States in our efforts in Afghanistan. We are always seeking ways to improve the SIV process while ensuring the integrity of the program and safeguarding our national security and affording opportunities to these Afghans.</p>
<p>We’ve identified process improvements and directed additional resources to the program, including augmenting staff here in Washington to process applications. It’s – and I mention that because it’s worth noting that much of the processing of applicants at the chief of mission stage occurs not in Kabul but here in Washington. And the team has significantly increased its staffing in recent months. We’ve also approved a temporary increase in consular staffing at our embassy in Kabul to conduct interviews and to process visa applications, which allowed the embassy to address cases that were delayed due to COVID-19 staffing reductions and related closures.</p>
<p>You also heard last week, I believe it was our deputy secretary for management and resources, in speaking to the budget, that we have requested an additional 8,000 SIV funding for – an additional 8,000 Special Immigrant Visas from Congress. And of course, we know that it’s not only the department, it’s not only the Executive Branch that is deeply, deeply committed to this program, but again, we are heartened to know that we have a partner in Congress, and a Congress that is very focused, just as we are on this program as well.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just follow up on that? Is there – are there any plans for evacuating people or doing this processing in a third country where it’s safer?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So what’s important – and again, I think it’s important to understand is that even as we withdraw militarily, our commitment to the government, and in this case, the people of Afghanistan will remain; our diplomatic facility in Kabul will, even after the September deadline for troops to be – U.S. military forces to be out of the country, our embassy will remain, will be able to continue processing. And we will do that as quickly and efficiently as we can, knowing, again, the special responsibility that we have to these brave Afghans.</p>
<p>Thank you. We’ll do one more.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-BURMA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. A court in Myanmar on Wednesday jailed two journalists for incitement and spreading false news, their organizations said. What’s the U.S. doing to secure their release, and has anyone been able to visit them?</p>
<p>And if I may, EU’s Foreign Affair Chief Borrell said today that the EU will impose a new round of sanctions on Myanmar’s military junta and its economic interests in the coming days. Will the – is the U.S. planning a coordinated announcement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, you didn’t ask about this precisely, but let me also take an opportunity to note that we are deeply concerned over the detention of U.S. citizens Daniel Fenster and Nathan Maung, both of whom were working as journalists in Burma. We’ve pressed the military regime to release them both immediately – to release both of them immediately. And we’ll continue to do so until they are allowed to return safely to their families.</p>
<p>And this gets to your broader question. Free and independent media is indispensable to building prosperous, resilient, and free societies. We have seen the junta in recent days attempt to stifle freedom of expression, freedom of assembly. And they do that knowing that only by suppressing the will of the Burmese people might they be able to retain some semblance of control. And so we will continue to press for the release of journalists who are detained in Burma. We will continue to press for the release of these two Americans. Our consular officers most recently conducted a virtual visit with Nathan Maung on May 24th. We have also sought to visit Daniel Fenster, but we haven’t been afforded access to him by regime officials.</p>
<p>So as we attempt to ensure the secure – the freedom of these journalists, we will be pressing the case for all journalists who are wrongfully detained in Burma for doing nothing more than their job, and ultimately knowing that their job is the – protecting the freedom of expression in – of the people of Burma.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So super quick &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><a id="post-249092-BRAZIL1"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you know how many doses are going to Brazil? Brazilian Government is saying 2 million. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So the announcement today was grouped by region, and we spoke of broad allocations to regions. There were, I believe, 6 million doses going to the region. But we haven’t spoken in terms of allocations to countries.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Thank you all very much.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 3:05 p.m.)</p>

<p>Treaty Room</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Hello, everyone.  It’s a real pleasure to welcome Defense Minister Gantz to the State Department.  We had an opportunity to spend some time together in Israel just a week or so ago.  Very happy today to have the opportunity to pursue that conversation, to talk about the United States enduring commitment to Israel security, to talk about some of the needs that Israel has in that regard; also to talk about the work that needs to be done to move forward on humanitarian assistance to and reconstruction for Gaza and for the Palestinians living there and to look across the board at the many issues that we have on our agenda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Benny, welcome.  It’s very good to have you here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEFENSE MINISTER GANTZ:  Thank you very much.  It’s a real pleasure to be here and reconvey Israel’s appreciation for the administration, for the President, for yourself, for the ongoing support, which is very important for us in our challenging area.  I’m looking forward to discuss, as we have discussed before, the challenges that we have with Iran, with the Palestinians.  As far as Gaza concerned, we do look for stability and prosperity for everybody.  And as defense minister, I think the combination between moving forward with construction and making sure that everything stays secure – it’s very important for me.  So thank you very much for your time, and I’m looking forward for the discussion. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The text of the following statement was released by the Governments of Japan and the United States of America.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin text:</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 27, 2021, interagency representatives from the United States and Japan met virtually to launch the U.S.-Japan Global Digital Connectivity Partnership (GDCP).  Announced during the summit meeting between President Biden and Prime Minister Suga on April 16, 2021, the GDCP deepens bilateral cooperation on the digital economy and next-generation digital technology issues.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GDCP builds upon previous cooperation, including through the Japan-U.S. Strategic Digital Economy Partnership (JUSDEP), by elevating and expanding the scope of discussions to promote secure connectivity and vibrant digital economies.  The GDCP will promote: (1) cooperation in third countries across the Indo-Pacific, Africa, Latin America, and other regions; (2) enhanced collaboration in multilateral fora; and (3) forward-looking mechanisms in both countries that catalyze investment in fifth-generation (5G) wireless technologies, next-generation telecommunications, and the corresponding research and development environment, as well as training and cybersecurity capacity building.  The initial meeting addressed an array of priority issues spanning these three categories.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The delegations from both governments, led by the U.S. Department of State and the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, decided to convene an expert-level working group multiple times per year within the structure of the U.S.-Japan Policy Cooperation Dialogue on the Internet Economy (IED).  The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen their competitiveness in the digital field and looked forward to the IED annual meeting to be held later this year. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>San Jose, Costa Rica</p>
<p>Chief of Mission Residence</p>
<p><strong>MS BERBENA:</strong> Well, welcome, everybody, and so delighted to see you. It is my distinct honor and privilege to welcome to the Chief of Mission Residence in San Jose the Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Sir, normally, we would have the entire embassy here to welcome you, but out of respect for COVID mitigation, we have a representative group of our team here that includes first and second-tour officers, LE staff, family members, employees and staff from the State Department and the other agencies that work with the mission.</p>
<p>You’ve had a very full 24 hours. You have engaged our leaders, our partners on issues that this mission works on every single day with tremendous commitment. But we saved the best for last, and that’s meeting our team, and I think you will find that there is no greater, more dedicated, more committed team than the people right here in front of you and those that are watching from a distance virtually. So, sir, welcome to the podium and the floor is yours. (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Thank you. Well, thank you all very, very much. Gloria, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for your wonderful stewardship these past 24 hours, but more to the point, thanks for the (inaudible).</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p>So deeply appreciate everything you’re doing at this mission, leading us every day. We have another important (inaudible).</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p>This is Diplomatic Security – (laughter) – at its finest, able to do anything on short notice, whatever contingency emerges. All right. There we go.</p>
<p>And when my wife Evan Ryan was assistant secretary for ECA, you worked closely together. It’s wonderful to be reconnected here. And I’m really, really pleased to be here in person. We’ve finally gotten to the point where we’re traveling again, we’re getting out, and at least even if we’re not in some places meeting face to face, we’re meeting mask to mask, and that’s at least an improvement over Zoom to Zoom.</p>
<p>And it’s no accident that the first port of call in Latin America, Central America, for me, for us, is right here in Costa Rica. I think it’s evidence of the fact that we have an incredibly strong and valued partner in Costa Rica across so many different things that matter, starting with a number of things that we did today, including dealing with the challenge posed by climate change, but also such a strong voice for the democratic principles that we share, and a voice that I think is more important than ever at a time when our democracies are being challenged.</p>
<p>So it was particularly important to come here, to be here, to spend time with our counterparts and also to see a little bit of some of the wonderful things that are happening, including the community center that is really quite – as I’m sure many of you know – remarkable in providing a sense of opportunity, a sense of hope for young people and, of course, evidence of the wonderful environmental leadership that Costa Rica is engaged in.</p>
<p>So it’s been, as the charge said, a compressed time, but we’ve had a terrific (inaudible). I really appreciate the great work that this mission has done to make this all come together – come together so well, come together so fast. I’ve got some idea from the years I’ve been doing it what goes into having – receiving guests from Washington. I can only wish you a very, very good wheels-up party – (laughter) – in a few short hours. But I think for me at least, the trip drove home the values that really connect the United States and Costa Rica. It’s a topic that actually came up in many of the conversations \we had with our counterparts and the work we’re doing to make progress together.</p>
<p>So I want to just really start again by thanking everyone for the success of the visit, but one of the things that I know as well is that these visits come and go. The real work in the relationship, the real work in building it, sustaining it, making it stronger is what happens every single day, and it’s in the work that each of you is doing.</p>
<p>And you’re finding ways, even in the midst of the pandemic, to grow and deepen the partnership. Just a few examples that were cited to me: You’re rolling out a $15 million project to help Costa Rican Government improve the capacity to reduce and prevent child sex trafficking, something that is truly meaningful and important.</p>
<p>You’ve implemented multiple projects to support refugees and vulnerable migrants in Costa Rica, including the Fundacion Mujer, a local NGO that provides English courses and career counseling, and Aqui Estoy, which gives food, health care, and job help to Venezuelan refugees. Parenthetically, I think one of the things that’s also so powerful about our friends here is the generosity and hospitality that they’ve extended, including to Venezuelans, including, of course, to Nicaraguans, given the deep ties that go back so many years between these countries.</p>
<p>You’ve also provided security assistance that’s helped Costa Rica become a major counternarcotics force in the region. You supported the wonderful project that we saw this morning, the Sembremos Seguridad, the citizen security program. And as I said, I saw their great work firsthand today. It was really quite wonderful, everything from seeing kids learn new skills, including skateboarding – I’m not sure that was – that might have been an indigenous skill – but two wonderful young children playing the violin, others doing judo, more doing pottery, others in a classroom learning. In fact, the classroom course was apparently focused today on negotiation skills, so I asked if I could sit in because I might learn something very important to take back with me. But I was really impressed by that, and it’s quite something to see community leaders, national leaders, police, mayors, everyone coming together and offering genuine hope and opportunity for young people, which really is the answer to so many of our challenges.</p>
<p>You’re leading the regional effort to stop illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing through the Team Fish interagency group. That too is one of those stories that’s a little bit underreported. But we see the havoc that that illegal fishing is wreaking in so many places around the world. It’s been devastating to local communities in many places whose livelihoods depend on fishing. It’s having an impact on biodiversity. And it’s something I think we’re going to increasingly be focused on.</p>
<p>A few months ago, you signed an MOU with the government to protect Costa Rica’s cultural property. I understand that MOU was languishing for more than 20 years until the public affairs section picked it up, ran with it, and got it done. So congratulations on that.</p>
<p>And, of course, there’s all the work that you’ve done to help mitigate the effects of COVID-19. Between April and September of last year, you helped repatriate more than 11,000 American citizens and more than 6,000 Costa Rican citizens. And thanks to you, Costa Rica was the first country in the region to receive three mobile field hospital tents, as well as PPE, lab supplies, hand washing stations, sanitizing gel, gel dispensers, all on behalf of the United States embassy.</p>
<p>I want you to know as well that in a few short days – in fact, possibly as early as tomorrow – the President is going to announce in more detail the plan that he’s put together to push out 80 million vaccines around the world that we have at our disposal or soon will have at our disposal. And we’re going to do that in coordination significantly with COVAX. We’re going to do that based on science and need. And we’re going to do that without any political strings attached.</p>
<p>Even as we’re doing that, we’re going to be working very hard on increasing manufacturing capacity in the United States and around the world so that we can get – finally get ahead of this virus and be the leader in vaccinating the world. If we stayed on the current trajectory, the one that we were on just a few weeks ago in terms of the pace of vaccination, we would not get to 70 or 80 percent vaccination around the world until 2024. We can speed this up; we’re going to speed this up. I think we have an opportunity to get this done by the end of next year. So stay tuned for that. It’s very, very important and the President’s been working very hard on getting this plan together.</p>
<p>I know what a challenging time this has been for everyone in this mission, dealing with COVID, having to do your jobs in the midst of a pandemic. I’m relieved that we have not lost any members of this embassy community. And I especially want to recognize the incredible work of the health unit here in San Jose, led by Amy (inaudible) Is Amy here? (Applause.) As well as Oscar (inaudible) – is Oscar here? (Applause.) From the Regional Security Office, who traveled to Bogota to bring additional vaccines to post so all of our contractors, all of our local guards could be vaccinated.</p>
<p>So we’ve been fortunate, and not just fortunate, we’ve been the beneficiaries of great work by our colleagues. But I know that some of you have lost loved ones, some of you have lost friends, and it’s hard to put words to that loss, except to say that I’m deeply sorry for the loss and deeply grateful to all of you who carried on in spite of those losses, and seeing the mission through.</p>
<p>Whether you’re an employee of the State Department or one of the many government agencies here at this mission; whether you’re a direct hire, a contractor, a family member; whether you’re locally employed staff, the lifeblood of this and every embassy, I just wanted to have an opportunity to say, very simply, thank you. Thank you for the wonderful work that you’re doing every single day on behalf of our country, on behalf of the relationship with Costa Rica, on behalf of making the world just a little bit safer, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit more hopeful. It’s wonderful work, it’s inspiring work, and I’m grateful to you for doing it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)</p>

From the Regional Security Office, who traveled to Bogota to bring additional vaccines to post so all of our contractors, all of our local guards could be vaccinated.</p>
<p>So we’ve been fortunate, and not just fortunate, we’ve been the beneficiaries of great work by our colleagues. But I know that some of you have lost loved ones, some of you have lost friends, and it’s hard to put words to that loss, except to say that I’m deeply sorry for the loss and deeply grateful to all of you who carried on in spite of those losses, and seeing the mission through.</p>
<p>Whether you’re an employee of the State Department or one of the many government agencies here at this mission; whether you’re a direct hire, a contractor, a family member; whether you’re locally employed staff, the lifeblood of this and every embassy, I just wanted to have an opportunity to say, very simply, thank you. Thank you for the wonderful work that you’re doing every single day on behalf of our country, on behalf of the relationship with Costa Rica, on behalf of making the world just a little bit safer, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit more hopeful. It’s wonderful work, it’s inspiring work, and I’m grateful to you for doing it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>San Jose, Costa Rica</p>
<p>Rutas Naturbanas</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b> Good afternoon. For Costa Rica it’s an honor to host the official visit of His Excellency Antony Blinken, Secretary of the United States of America. Also we are pleased to receive his distinguished delegation. For the Ministry of Environment and Energy, it’s a pleasure to host this event regarding nature-based solution for climate action in cities and its links with information systems. We give special thanks to the Central Bank of Costa Rica for being our meeting venue today. As mentioned before, we also greet Mrs. Claudia Dobles, first lady of the republic; Mrs. Andrea Meza, minister of environment and energy; Mr. Rodolfo Solano, minister of foreign affairs and worship; Mr. Andres Valenciano, minister of foreign trade; Mr. Rodrigo Cubero, president of the Central Bank of Costa Rica; and, of course, all the high authorities, members of diplomatic missions, private sector, non-state actors, ladies and gentlemen. With this, please now let’s hear our welcoming remarks from Mrs. Andrea Meza, minister of environment and energy. (Speaks in Spanish.)</p>
<p><b>ENVIRONMENT MINISTER MEZA:</b> Good morning. Good morning to everyone here, and I will start by saying that all protocol is observed, so let’s feel free, in a comfortable place. We are between friends. Good morning, Secretary Blinken – (speaks in Spanish) – which is more than our first lady. She’s our team leader in sustainable mobility and green cities. (Speaks in Spanish) Rodolfo Solano, minister of foreign affairs; Andres Valenciano, minister of foreign trade; Rodrigo Cubero, thank you for hosting us, for hosting this event; deputy ministers, diplomatic representatives, U.S. delegation, friends, thank you for being here.</p>
<p>Secretary and friends, we’re so pleased to be sharing this wonderful setting where we can see the seeds of how we can be transforming our cities, making them greener, embracing nature with more public spaces, with sustainable buildings – cities planned for our citizens and not for our cars. And this is the vision for the future. This is the city that we want and the city that we are fighting for right now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Secretary Blinken, we mentioned that Costa Rica wants to be a strategic partner to catalyze a more inclusive green resilient development model for the Central American region. And let me elaborate a little bit more of what we understand is this green resilient model. We understand that it needs a transformational change that will take us to a net zero emission and a nature-positive economy. We need to move from just trying to create growth to a more systemic approach to generate welfare for our citizens, to boost our economies, to generate jobs but within the planetary boundaries, and addressing inequalities, generating solutions that offer justice to the countries and communities that have done little to create the climate problem.</p>
<p>And we know we can achieve that vision, and it is critical to do it fast. This is what the science is telling us. But the good news is that we have the technology, we have the resources, and right now we have the political will. And this is what makes everything happen for this transformational change. We recognized yesterday that we need to put people in the center of our development model, and I would just add that it is people and nature.</p>
<p>This pandemic is showing us how interconnected we are. If we want to see and if we want to have healthy economics, we need – and healthy societies, we need healthy ecosystems. And if we want to address the climate crisis, we need nature-based solutions.</p>
<p>But this is also a matter of opportunities, and to build the economy of the future, which within is circular, green, and blue. We must acknowledge that nature is an asset, and that we’re doing a terrible job right now in managing this portfolio.</p>
<p>Let me just share one report, one data from the Dasgupta report. It says that between 1992 and 2014, produced capital per person doubled, and human capital per person increased by about 30 percent globally. But the stock of natural capital per person declined by nearly 40 percent.</p>
<p>Nature-related risk matters to the business community. And do you know why? There we have representatives from the business community here. Because over half of the world’s total GDP is moderately or highly dependent on nature. And a nature-positive economy could create more than 400 million jobs by 2030, and we want those jobs for this region. And this is why we’re creating all this. We’re launching our decarbonization plan. We’re having specific packages of policies for short, medium, and long-term actions for strategic sectors – transport, energy, industry, construction, circular economy, agriculture, and nature-based solutions.</p>
<p>But the implementation of these measures needs a whole-of-government approach, and a whole-of-society approach. This is why we’re working with the different sectorial ministries – transport, agriculture. We’re working with the central bank. We’re working with foreign trade. Because we need alignment in these policies. And we are committed with the goals of the Paris Agreement. And we are also clear that we need to generate these good enabling conditions to facilitate engagement of the private sector and civil society in this agenda.</p>
<p>And this is why we selected this place, because Rutas Naturbanas, the project behind this, it’s an example of how we can integrate these kind of visions. Rutas Naturbanas is a grassroots, citizen-led initiative that was started in 2016 by a group of people and organizations committed to climate action and urban renewal, with the mandate – and this is so nice; I love the mandate – to connect people to the city through nature. And here we have Federico Cartin, who is one of the leaders. And we also have Daniel Mikoski as our representative from some of the private sector that it is supporting the initiative.</p>
<p>What I will say is that this project is showing us that it is possible to have public-private partnerships to be transforming the city and to be implementing decarbonization visions.</p>
<p>We also have other good examples through the different, nice stories that we have with CRUSA and the support with a lot of different entrepreneurs, SMEs, so they can adopt green practices, and with other of our strategic partners, such as AED. They are here.</p>
<p>And the other element that has been very interesting with Rutas Naturbanas is that many of the partners are (inaudible) members. And crowdfunding by the foundation has been majorly made possible through American contributions. So we want to thank these.</p>
<p>And the other element for this transformation is to have a robust, good, technical information. We strongly believe in science and data-based policy-making processes. And this is why we’re celebrating the launch of the formalization of the Costa Rica Comprehensive National Land Use, Land Cover, and Ecosystem Monitoring System, SIMOCUTE, with the official announcement of the executive decree that was signed by the president, the minister of agriculture, justice, and by myself – again, another instrument that is showing that it is possible to have this integrated approach.</p>
<p>But this is – this was possible because of the long-term presence and sustained funding from the U.S. Government, and alongside other international agencies like FAO, so thank you very much for the support.</p>
<p>This is the other element that it is critical: whole of government, whole of society, good information. So Secretary Blinken, thank you for all the support the U.S. has given us at the national level. Thank you for continuing your leadership in mobilizing climate finance for nature-based solutions.</p>
<p>As we mentioned yesterday, we welcome the LEAF Coalition presented by the United Kingdom, the U.S., and Norway. We’re working to submit a proposal soon. Count on us to accelerate climate action. Count on us in the multilateral arena to continue raising ambition on our way to Glasgow. We want to have a success COP and we are committed to that. Count on us to work in the Central American region. We’re partners that share values. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b> <i>Muchas gracias</i>, Minister. Thank you, Minister Meza.</p>
<p>We invite His Excellency Antony Blinken, Secretary of State of the United States of America to give his remarks. Excellency.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> Well, good afternoon, everyone, and first, Madam Minister, thank you. Thank you for not just your good words, but your important words, and also thank you for the partnership that we have, the United States and Costa Rica, on maybe the most critical issue of our times, and that is preserving and protecting our environment, combating climate change, and saving our planet. We value this partnership and we look to it, I think, more and more in the years ahead.</p>
<p>And let me say, first of all, greetings to everyone. Madam Minister, First Lady, thank you for honoring us with your presence today, and I very much enjoy the opportunity to speak as we were walking down this extraordinary corridor that I think is an example, really, to the world of how you bring people together with their cities through nature. It’s a very powerful idea, but it’s not – it’s more than an idea. We see it realized right here.</p>
<p>And as we were discussing, there is a powerful impact on all of our lives when we have an opportunity, especially those of us who live in cities, to spend some time surrounded by green, to be near the water and the extraordinary rivers that you have, to hear that sound. It has a profound, positive effect, I think, on all of us, and it’s wonderful to see this realized in a practical way right here.</p>
<p>But to both of you, to my colleague Rodolfo, and to all of the ministers here today, I think your presence speaks to Costa Rica’s recognition that all parts of government and all parts of our society, including the private sector, have a role to play in tackling the climate crisis – and more than tackling it, bringing nature and people together in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>I’m also delighted to celebrate the launch of Costa Rica’s National Land Use, Land Cover, and Ecosystems Monitoring System, as the minister mentioned, SIMOCUTE.</p>
<p>This system will make it possible for Costa Rica to collect and integrate high-quality data on natural, agricultural, and biodiversity resources across the entire country. And the aim is not just to measure the impact of greenhouse gas emissions but also to inform better decision making when it comes to managing forests and lands.</p>
<p>Its origins can be traced back to a partnership between Costa Rican experts, a U.S. Government climate fellow, Dr. Randy Hamilton, and several Costa Rican and U.S. Government agencies including, I’m pleased and proud to say, the United States Department of State. And the effort incorporated a range of partners including from the UN Food and Agricultural Organizations and 25 Costa Rican institutions – some of whom I know are represented here today.</p>
<p>This is precisely the kind of collaboration and knowledge sharing across borders, public and private institutions that’s essential to effectively tackling the climate challenge and the climate crisis.</p>
<p>The data it generates will be available online for all to access allowing experts and citizens alike to study them, to track whether government and private actors are actually meeting their commitments. That degree of transparency – and engagement of the citizens – I think is a model that others can and should aspire to.</p>
<p>Of course, SIMOCUTE program is just a small part of Costa Rica’s longstanding global leadership on climate. That’s evident in the targets that Costa Rica has set to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Its proactive role in international climate change negotiations is pioneering use of debt-for-nature swaps.</p>
<p>And of course, what we know too is the powerful use and reliance on renewable energy here also sets a very, very strong example. Protecting nature by creating additional value for forests is at the heart of a new initiative the United States recently announced together with the United Kingdom, Norway, and nine leading companies at the climate summit that President Biden convened in April. And the minister referred to it – the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance Coalition. It’s a mouthful but the acronym, LEAF, is quite wonderful. It aims to mobilize at least a billion dollars this year to support tropical and subtropical countries in their efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.</p>
<p>The concept is straightforward: generating verified emissions reductions can be rewarded with payments. These are the kinds of emissions SIMOCUTE is well placed to track. And given Costa Rica’s longstanding efforts to reduce deforestation and restore forests, we hope this is another area where indeed we can work together.</p>
<p>With nearly one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions today coming from forests, from agriculture, and other lands, this is an area where we must make significant and swift progress if we are going to avert a climate catastrophe.</p>
<p>I’d also like to thank Ambassador Lyster-Binns from the UK who I think is here today – somewhere – Ambassador. Good to see you. Thank you for your government’s partnership on this initiative.</p>
<p>I think we both know that this is not a battle that countries like Costa Rica can wage alone. Big emitters have their part to do.</p>
<p>The United States is prepared to lead by example, as President Biden demonstrated in the recent targets that he set for our country to cut emissions by at least half in 2030; to double the public international climate finance we provide, to $5.7 billion annually, by 2024.</p>
<p>And that brings me to my last point, which is why we are making such massive investments. Efforts to reduce emissions and build climate resilience are sometimes, maybe even often, presented as an impediment to growth, a strain on economies. But we believe that the climate crisis should be seen differently – as a once-in-generations opportunity to generate good-paying, sustainable jobs, something the minister also alluded to.</p>
<p>Every country in the world needs to reduce emissions, invest in climate resilience, capture more carbon dioxide. That’s an open space for innovation and broad-based growth – if only we seize it.</p>
<p>And I think that’s been Costa Rica’s experience, as Minister Meza pointed out at the climate summit, when she highlighted the millions of dollars in revenue that Costa Rica’s protected areas generate for communities, and the sustainable livelihoods that they support.</p>
<p>It is, as I said at the start, both a pleasure but also I think important that we are partnered in this effort. This is not just a once-in-a-generations opportunity, it’s in a sense a once-in-a-lifetime obligation that we have before us to try to get this right. We’re only going to succeed if we do it together, if we work in partnership, if we all meet our responsibilities and, in doing that, finding incredible opportunity in those responsibilities. So thank you so much for the warm welcome, but more important, thank you for what we’re doing, the United States and Costa Rica, every day to make progress for our people and for our planet. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR: </b>Thank you, your excellency. With this, now invite to the stage Mrs. Claudia Dobles, our first lady of the republic, to give her closing speech. Claudia.</p>
<p><b>MRS DOBLES:</b> Good day to everybody. Your excellency, Mr. Antony Blinken, Secretary of State of the United States, thank you so much for your visit for you and your team. Good day to all the ministers, vice ministers, and everybody from the government, from civil society, from all the institutions that work with us as a team. Thank you for being here today.</p>
<p>I would like to start saying that Costa Rica, it’s very well known for pioneering innovative policies, like abolishing the army more than 70 years ago, for investing and focusing on our health care which is universal and is free. That has been a enormous pillar in fighting this sanitary crisis. Also, that we invested in our people. That is the best resources that we have in Costa Rica is the talent of our people. So we don’t have oil, we don’t have other natural resources possibly; we don’t even want to explore that because we are pretty much focusing on our people and our human talent.</p>
<p>President Alvarado when we started this administration said very accurately that climate crisis is a challenge of this generation and that we really need to act and we need to act now. And we are in a pivotal point to make decisions for the future. That’s why we focusing on how to make a more equitable society, how to put our communities in the center, how to put our people in the center, how to put the services that we needed to provide in the center while lowering our carbon emissions, transitioning in a very just and fair transition towards a decarbonized economy; how to provide a new system, a new paradigm. So that’s why facing that we launch a little bit more than two years ago our national decarbonization plan. And it is important to say that while this is going to tackle climate crisis, it’s more of a social economical development based on sustainability and based on our people that we are talking about. So that is very important and this is something that we keep saying to our communities, that these type of interventions, that providing this type of quality of life, this is decarbonization, this is our national decarbonization plan. It’s part of it.</p>
<p>It’s important to say that Costa Rica, it’s pretty well-known – I was saying to Secretary Blinken that Costa Rica, it’s pretty much well-known for our biodiversity, our beaches, our mountains, our rivers. And we have done a very good job on nature-based solutions, on carbon capture, on reforestation, conservation. But if we really wanted to achieve the goals that we have in our national decarbonization plan, we really needed to focus on our urban agenda and we really need to start talking about urban planning, territorial planning. We need to start talking about how can we interconnect the public services that we provide to our people in order to provide better quality of life in order to enhance public transportation to incorporate the concepts of sustainable mobility. How can we work with the national government and the local governments and the rest of our society to provide answers bottom-up?</p>
<p>If we really want to tackle our goals, we need to focus on this urban agenda. That’s why under the leadership of the wonderful minister of environment, which I really want to thank you for your leadership, I have to say that this has been a team work, a whole government that is completely committed, that shared a vision, that really is working to achieve that vision and to create enabling conditions to continue this transition while – before we move to the next administration so the next administration can continue this transformation.</p>
<p>So thank you to all the government and the staff members that have been – made this possible. I really – I really have to say that this is teamwork. It’s even more important when we think about the recovery plans that we need to provide in a post-COVID era, and that we really need to focus on a green recovery, and when we – when we were talking about our national decarbonization plan, we provided specific actions that provided investment plans for a resilient infrastructure that will create new jobs, that will create new markets, that will create new industries based on new, clean technologies, based on the culture of knowledge, and based on sustainability. So I think our national decarbonization plan is also our green recovery plan post-COVID.</p>
<p>And Secretary Blinken said something that I think is very important. Costa Rica cannot do it alone. We have a strong voice and I am very proud to say that Costa Rica has a strong voice on sustainability. But we are not fighting this fight alone. We know that this is a global fight and we know that we have strategic partners in this, and we are very, very happy and I think the world is very happy to see that under President Biden’s administration, the U.S. has a strong commitment, a huge commitment in climate – in climate change and climate crisis.</p>
<p>So thank you very much, Secretary Blinken, for you and your team, and I am sure that we will keep working together. As the Minister Meza said, count on us because we’re committed, and we share the vision, and we share the values. Thank you so much for your visit, and we’ll keep working. Thank you so much. (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b> <i>Muchas gracias, Dona Claudia.</i> Ladies and gentlemen, with this we have concluded the event. Thank you for being here and have a great afternoon.</p>

<p>And of course, what we know too is the powerful use and reliance on renewable energy here also sets a very, very strong example. Protecting nature by creating additional value for forests is at the heart of a new initiative the United States recently announced together with the United Kingdom, Norway, and nine leading companies at the climate summit that President Biden convened in April. And the minister referred to it – the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance Coalition. It’s a mouthful but the acronym, LEAF, is quite wonderful. It aims to mobilize at least a billion dollars this year to support tropical and subtropical countries in their efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.</p>
<p>The concept is straightforward: generating verified emissions reductions can be rewarded with payments. These are the kinds of emissions SIMOCUTE is well placed to track. And given Costa Rica’s longstanding efforts to reduce deforestation and restore forests, we hope this is another area where indeed we can work together.</p>
<p>With nearly one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions today coming from forests, from agriculture, and other lands, this is an area where we must make significant and swift progress if we are going to avert a climate catastrophe.</p>
<p>I’d also like to thank Ambassador Lyster-Binns from the UK who I think is here today – somewhere – Ambassador. Good to see you. Thank you for your government’s partnership on this initiative.</p>
<p>I think we both know that this is not a battle that countries like Costa Rica can wage alone. Big emitters have their part to do.</p>
<p>The United States is prepared to lead by example, as President Biden demonstrated in the recent targets that he set for our country to cut emissions by at least half in 2030; to double the public international climate finance we provide, to $5.7 billion annually, by 2024.</p>
<p>And that brings me to my last point, which is why we are making such massive investments. Efforts to reduce emissions and build climate resilience are sometimes, maybe even often, presented as an impediment to growth, a strain on economies. But we believe that the climate crisis should be seen differently – as a once-in-generations opportunity to generate good-paying, sustainable jobs, something the minister also alluded to.</p>
<p>Every country in the world needs to reduce emissions, invest in climate resilience, capture more carbon dioxide. That’s an open space for innovation and broad-based growth – if only we seize it.</p>
<p>And I think that’s been Costa Rica’s experience, as Minister Meza pointed out at the climate summit, when she highlighted the millions of dollars in revenue that Costa Rica’s protected areas generate for communities, and the sustainable livelihoods that they support.</p>
<p>It is, as I said at the start, both a pleasure but also I think important that we are partnered in this effort. This is not just a once-in-a-generations opportunity, it’s in a sense a once-in-a-lifetime obligation that we have before us to try to get this right. We’re only going to succeed if we do it together, if we work in partnership, if we all meet our responsibilities and, in doing that, finding incredible opportunity in those responsibilities. So thank you so much for the warm welcome, but more important, thank you for what we’re doing, the United States and Costa Rica, every day to make progress for our people and for our planet. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR: </b>Thank you, your excellency. With this, now invite to the stage Mrs. Claudia Dobles, our first lady of the republic, to give her closing speech. Claudia.</p>
<p><b>MRS DOBLES:</b> Good day to everybody. Your excellency, Mr. Antony Blinken, Secretary of State of the United States, thank you so much for your visit for you and your team. Good day to all the ministers, vice ministers, and everybody from the government, from civil society, from all the institutions that work with us as a team. Thank you for being here today.</p>
<p>I would like to start saying that Costa Rica, it’s very well known for pioneering innovative policies, like abolishing the army more than 70 years ago, for investing and focusing on our health care which is universal and is free. That has been a enormous pillar in fighting this sanitary crisis. Also, that we invested in our people. That is the best resources that we have in Costa Rica is the talent of our people. So we don’t have oil, we don’t have other natural resources possibly; we don’t even want to explore that because we are pretty much focusing on our people and our human talent.</p>
<p>President Alvarado when we started this administration said very accurately that climate crisis is a challenge of this generation and that we really need to act and we need to act now. And we are in a pivotal point to make decisions for the future. That’s why we focusing on how to make a more equitable society, how to put our communities in the center, how to put our people in the center, how to put the services that we needed to provide in the center while lowering our carbon emissions, transitioning in a very just and fair transition towards a decarbonized economy; how to provide a new system, a new paradigm. So that’s why facing that we launch a little bit more than two years ago our national decarbonization plan. And it is important to say that while this is going to tackle climate crisis, it’s more of a social economical development based on sustainability and based on our people that we are talking about. So that is very important and this is something that we keep saying to our communities, that these type of interventions, that providing this type of quality of life, this is decarbonization, this is our national decarbonization plan. It’s part of it.</p>
<p>It’s important to say that Costa Rica, it’s pretty well-known – I was saying to Secretary Blinken that Costa Rica, it’s pretty much well-known for our biodiversity, our beaches, our mountains, our rivers. And we have done a very good job on nature-based solutions, on carbon capture, on reforestation, conservation. But if we really wanted to achieve the goals that we have in our national decarbonization plan, we really needed to focus on our urban agenda and we really need to start talking about urban planning, territorial planning. We need to start talking about how can we interconnect the public services that we provide to our people in order to provide better quality of life in order to enhance public transportation to incorporate the concepts of sustainable mobility. How can we work with the national government and the local governments and the rest of our society to provide answers bottom-up?</p>
<p>If we really want to tackle our goals, we need to focus on this urban agenda. That’s why under the leadership of the wonderful minister of environment, which I really want to thank you for your leadership, I have to say that this has been a team work, a whole government that is completely committed, that shared a vision, that really is working to achieve that vision and to create enabling conditions to continue this transition while – before we move to the next administration so the next administration can continue this transformation.</p>
<p>So thank you to all the government and the staff members that have been – made this possible. I really – I really have to say that this is teamwork. It’s even more important when we think about the recovery plans that we need to provide in a post-COVID era, and that we really need to focus on a green recovery, and when we – when we were talking about our national decarbonization plan, we provided specific actions that provided investment plans for a resilient infrastructure that will create new jobs, that will create new markets, that will create new industries based on new, clean technologies, based on the culture of knowledge, and based on sustainability. So I think our national decarbonization plan is also our green recovery plan post-COVID.</p>
<p>And Secretary Blinken said something that I think is very important. Costa Rica cannot do it alone. We have a strong voice and I am very proud to say that Costa Rica has a strong voice on sustainability. But we are not fighting this fight alone. We know that this is a global fight and we know that we have strategic partners in this, and we are very, very happy and I think the world is very happy to see that under President Biden’s administration, the U.S. has a strong commitment, a huge commitment in climate – in climate change and climate crisis.</p>
<p>So thank you very much, Secretary Blinken, for you and your team, and I am sure that we will keep working together. As the Minister Meza said, count on us because we’re committed, and we share the vision, and we share the values. Thank you so much for your visit, and we’ll keep working. Thank you so much. (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b> <i>Muchas gracias, Dona Claudia.</i> Ladies and gentlemen, with this we have concluded the event. Thank you for being here and have a great afternoon.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Jalina Porter, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:02 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-DEPARTMENT"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today’s briefing. I have three updates at the top and then we’ll resume taking your questions. I’d like to start off today by noting the tragic passing of our friend and colleague Tejinder Singh, who was the founder and editor of India America Today. Tejinder covered the State Department for 11 years, participating in many State Department briefings both in person and also calling in every telephonic briefing. We already miss seeing his name in the question queue here today. Tejinder was well-known for being a kind and generous colleague, and also for keeping us on our toes with his questions. Our thoughts are with his family, friends, and colleagues as we grieve his loss. And I speak for my colleagues here when I say that he was such a pleasure to work with for all of us, and his presence will be sorely missed.</p>
<p>Yesterday the United States began celebrating the first day of Pride Month. Not only do we recognize how far we have come in the fight for the protection of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex persons, but we also acknowledge the distance that remains on the path to full equality and equity.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-_Hlk73544734"></a> The United States is committed to increasing U.S. engagement on LGBTQI+ issues intersectionally<sup><a id="post-248345-footnote-ref-1" href="#post-248345-footnote-1"></a></sup>, working to ensure the same-sex spouses for our diplomats assigned abroad are afforded the same privileges and immunities as opposite-sex spouses, and empowering local movements and persons advancing the rights of LGBTQI+ persons. We are proud of our work with local and international partners to build a more inclusive global society for all LGBTQI+ communities.</p>
<p>We seek to increase the visibility of and address the acute challenges faced by particularly marginalized members of these communities, including women and girls, transgender, non-binary, and intersex persons. Although the United States still has work to do, we strive to lead by example in the promotion and protection of human rights for all persons.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-SECRETARY"></a> And finally, as you know, Secretary Blinken was in Costa Rica yesterday and today, where he met with senior government officials from across the Central American region to discuss how our countries can work together to create a more democratic, prosperous, and secure region. They also worked to deepening the region’s collaborative approach to shared challenges of irregular migration.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Secretary attended a meeting with foreign ministers and vice ministers from all seven Central American countries, as well as Mexico and the Dominican Republic. They discussed issues essential to the wellbeing of people in this region, including strategies for addressing root causes of migration and managing migration flows in and throughout the region; combating corruption and strengthening democratic institutions; generating inclusive economic growth; recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic; and healthy environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken also met yesterday with President Alvarado and Foreign Minister Solano of Costa Rica to discuss the strong partnership between our countries on migration, climate change, and security. In addition, he met with the foreign secretary of Mexico and the foreign ministers of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to discuss vital work to address migration and other challenges within those countries.</p>
<p>This morning, Secretary Blinken visited a pair of joint U.S.-Costa Rican initiatives that show how the United States can successfully partner with the region to help build a better future. <a id="post-248345-_Hlk73544790"></a>He first visited a neighborhood that benefits from “<em>Sembremos Seguridad</em>,” an initiative<sup><a id="post-248345-footnote-ref-2" href="#post-248345-footnote-2"></a></sup> citizen security program for at-risk youth. He then visited an environmental stewardship initiative that sets a model for efforts to reduce deforestation and fight climate change in the region. He also sat down with a Costa Rican media outlet to communicate with local audiences and demonstrate support for media independence in Central America.</p>
<p>This trip is a part of the administration’s focus on Central America. Vice President Harris will be headed to the region next week to further advance our efforts to improve conditions for people of Central America, which also advances the interests of people in the United States.</p>
<p>And with that, we’ll give it a few minutes before taking your questions.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the 1, 0 command. If you are using a speaker phone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, you may press 1 then 0 at this time.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Let’s go to Pearl Matibe, please.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-ETHIOPIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Jalina. Good afternoon. Hope you’re having a great day today. My question is regarding President Joe Biden’s upcoming trip with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. And I’m just wondering after the sanctions and recent diplomatic tools you’re using regarding Ethiopia, Russia is now preparing to have an Africa summit in 2022. Is Africa going to be part of the agenda between President Biden and President Putin given the fact that Africa over the next decades beyond Biden’s administration will have such a huge population and role to play in the world? Is Africa going to be a significant topic on that agenda, and does the United States anticipate an Africa summit as well? Do you have anything to share? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thank you for your question, Pearl. Well, what I will say broadly is that Africa is a priority for – the relationship with Africa is a priority for the Biden administration, but I certainly won’t get ahead of any meetings and don’t have anything to share for you at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Casey O’Neill.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-BURMA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, hi, Jalina. Thanks so much for doing this. I – my question is actually on Myanmar. So I know today – earlier today, excuse me – Deputy Secretary Sherman in Bangkok delivered some remarks and spoke about the two American journalists that are detained in Myanmar, Danny Fenster and Nathan Maung. Their – excuse me – Mr. Fenster’s family has also been making the rounds on television and spoke earlier this morning and said that the United States Government has requested consular access, but so far that request has not been addressed by the military junta in Myanmar. So I’m just wondering if you could provide us any update on steps that the U.S. Government is taking to ensure that these two detained journalists are safe and if you have any update on whether or not the embassy personnel have been able to gain consular access to them. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks for your question, Casey. Well, I’ll start off by saying that the safety and safe return of U.S. citizens is a priority for the United States. At this time we have nothing to announce or any updates about these two specific cases.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Rosiland Jordan.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-CHINA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Jalina. Thanks for taking my call. I have two questions. One: The anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre is coming up. Is the U.S. sending a message to Beijing about how its security forces should handle themselves on this anniversary, both in mainland China and in Hong Kong?</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-IRAN"></a> And the other question has to do with, one, the sinking of an Iranian oil tanker, the <em>Kharg</em>, in the Gulf of Oman, was – does the U.S. have any more information about whether this was an accident or perhaps an act of sabotage? And connected to that, does the U.S. have any more updates on the travel of two Iranian warships that rumor – that the rumors suggest may be heading to Venezuela? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Rosiland. I’ll start with your first question on Tiananmen, and I’ll start by broadly saying that the United States condemns actions by Hong Kong authorities that prompted organizers to close the June 4th Museum that commemorates the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. As far as your question of sending any particular messages, no, we’re not sending any direct messages at this time, other than saying that Hong Kong and Beijing authorities continue to silence dissenting voices by also attempting to erase the horrific massacre from history.</p>
<p>And to your question on Iran, speaking of the naval ships on the Gulf of Oman, well, we’ve definitely seen the media reports on the Iranian naval vessels that have caught fire and have sank. Other than that, we don’t have anything to announce at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Rich Edson.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-WORLDHEALTHASSEMBLY"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Jalina, just looking into the conclusion of the World Health Assembly, there is really no sense of a phase two investigation or commitment to one, Taiwan was excluded from the proceedings, Syria and Belarus are now on the executive committee. I was just wondering if you could provide what the State Department’s assessment of the proceedings were and how the U.S. plans on attempting to follow through with reforms of the World Health Organization.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Rich. What I’ll say is to your point about countries that you’ve mentioned. We have grave concerns that Syria and Belarus have been elected for a three-year term by the World Health Assembly Executive Board. Members of the executive board each have a duty to advance public health and likewise are expected to uphold universal values as well as human rights. And, of course, this would include providing access for delivery of lifesaving humanitarian supplies, and that would include medical equipment as well. <a id="post-248345-_Hlk73544881"></a>We don’t believe the actions of either Syria or Belarus demonstrate this, and although the U.S. is not currently part of the executive board, we’ll continue to monitor closely the board’s activities and make clear that – U.S. exemptions<sup><a id="post-248345-footnote-ref-3" href="#post-248345-footnote-3"></a></sup> that the board members uphold the highest standards of human rights.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Laura Rozen.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-IRAN1"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have anything on the latest round of Iran talks in Vienna, which I think are wrapping up right now.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Laura. So the delegation led by Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley is currently in Vienna, and he’s in Vienna for a fifth round of talks. And any update to share that he actually may come back to Washington for consultations at the end of the week. Outside of that, I’d just underscore that these last few rounds of discussion have actually helped crystallize the choices that need to be made by Iran, and also by us, the United States, in order to achieve a mutual return to compliance of the JCPOA.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Soyoung Kim, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> About North Korea, Deputy Secretary Sherman said today that the U.S. has made its policy known to the DPRK. Can you clarify whether this means the U.S. recently reached out to North Korea again or the separate contact made a few months ago the Department of State had confirmed before? And any response from North Korea?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Hi, thanks for the question. I won’t get ahead of Deputy Secretary Sherman’s comments, and any other update we’ll be able to preview at a later time but nothing’s going out today.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Said Arikat.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Said’s line has left the queue.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> All right. With that, let’s go to Michel Ghandour, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I have two questions on Iran. Sources in Vienna said that the parties reached a draft agreement. Can you confirm that? And any comment on the fire in Tehran’s refinery today?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks for your question. Nothing to announce. I’m not able to confirm the reports of a fire in Tehran today, but just to underscore what was mentioned previously, our Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley, he’s currently in Vienna for his fifth round of talks and should be coming back to Washington sometime later this week. Anything beyond that and the decisions and the discussions that have been made, I have nothing to announce.</p>
<p>Looks like we have Said Arikat back in the queue. We’ll go to Said.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Thank you, Jalina. And I also want to thank you for mentioning my good friend, Tejinder. May God bless his soul. We will miss him dearly. Jalina, I wanted to ask you about two issues: one, if you have any comment on a report by <em>The Washington Post</em> that Israel is preventing cancer patients from leaving Gaza through the Erez Crossing, if you have any comment on that. I also want to ask about the whereabouts of Mr. Hady Amr right now, and what is next on his agenda? What is he doing? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you for your question, Said. And again, to underscore, we definitely will all miss Tejinder and his spirit, and his vigor and his contributions to not only foreign affairs but journalism as well.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-_Hlk73546868"></a> To your first question on cancer, I certainly look forward to these reports and would have to get back to you specifically on that question. And I’d have to do the same for your question on Hady and what he’s doing. We don’t have anything to announce at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Lara Jakes.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> I do not see Lara Jakes’s line in queue.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Okay. Let’s go to the line of Jennifer Hansler.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> It looks like Jennifer’s line is not in queue either.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> All right. Let’s go to the line of Hiba Nasr.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. I have one question about Israel. First, we saw during Secretary Blinken’s visit to Israel two weeks ago, he extended an invitation to the Israeli president to visit Washington, and tomorrow that Israeli defense minister is visiting Washington. Did this administration extend an invitation to Prime Minister Netanyahu to visit Washington? And my second question is on Nord Stream 2; yesterday Republicans in the House sent a letter to Secretary Blinken expressing concern over the decision to – over the decision to apply a waiver to some sanctions. Do you have any comments on that?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thanks, Hiba, for your first question on extending an invitation – on invites. We have nothing at all to announce on that. And your second question on NS2, I’ll have to take that one back for you.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Claudia Uceda.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-COSTARICA"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. First is: How can Costa Rica help stop illegal immigration flow into the U.S.? What is the Secretary looking into specifically? And my second question is about Nicaragua. I would like a reaction to the fact that <a id="post-248345-NICARAGUA"></a>Nicaraguan prosecutors question and are investigating 16 independent journalists, and they are threatening them with a criminal investigation related to money laundering investigation into Violeta Chamorro, who is a prospective candidate. What’s your reaction to that? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thank you, Claudia. So to your first question, I won’t get into specifics on what Costa Rica should be doing when it comes to the fight for regular migration, but I will say that Costa Rica honestly is a top partner of the United States and it has a strong democracy. And we do have shared values as well as shared commitments. And part of that is championing human rights across the board, and that will be integral into fighting that common challenge together. To your second question, I’ll just say broadly speaking that the United States supports the freedom of the press and will continue to champion that not only in Nicaragua but all over the world.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Nick Wadhams.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-IRAN2"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Inaudible) press you a tiny bit more on Iran. In the past, you guys have said that there had been progress in the talks, though a lot of differences remained, and the U.S. and Iran were sort of closer to the start of the talks than they were toward the end of the talks. So do you believe that progress continues to be made? Have those talks stalled? And do you feel that the two sides are gradually inching closer to a resolution? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Well, certainly some progress has been made, and like I said, Rob Malley is in Vienna. He’ll be returning to Washington pretty soon. And again, talks are ongoing. And they will continue at a pace that’s honestly appropriate to address the significance of the issues that are currently on the table being negotiated right now. And I’ll continue to underscore that discussions like this are always thorough. They’re thoughtful. They’re businesslike even though they are indirect. And of course that’s to be expected. This isn’t going to be a quick or easy process.</p>
<p>It looks like we have Jennifer Hansler back on the line, so I’ll take that last question from her.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hello.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Hi, Jennifer.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi, Jalina. Thanks so much for taking my question. Just a little more on Iran, can you confirm that the indirect talks will resume next week? And then separately, has there been any communication with Russia in the wake of the latest cyber-attack on JBS? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thanks for your questions, Jennifer. To your first one, I don’t have anything to announce of any – for any future talks. And the second question, we’ll have to take that one back for you.</p>
<p>And thank you all very much for joining today’s briefing. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:29 p.m.)</p>

<p>2:02 p.m. EDT</p>

He also sat down with a Costa Rican media outlet to communicate with local audiences and demonstrate support for media independence in Central America.</p>
<p>This trip is a part of the administration’s focus on Central America. Vice President Harris will be headed to the region next week to further advance our efforts to improve conditions for people of Central America, which also advances the interests of people in the United States.</p>
<p>And with that, we’ll give it a few minutes before taking your questions.</p>

<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Let’s go to Pearl Matibe, please.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-ETHIOPIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Jalina. Good afternoon. Hope you’re having a great day today. My question is regarding President Joe Biden’s upcoming trip with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. And I’m just wondering after the sanctions and recent diplomatic tools you’re using regarding Ethiopia, Russia is now preparing to have an Africa summit in 2022. Is Africa going to be part of the agenda between President Biden and President Putin given the fact that Africa over the next decades beyond Biden’s administration will have such a huge population and role to play in the world? Is Africa going to be a significant topic on that agenda, and does the United States anticipate an Africa summit as well? Do you have anything to share? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thank you for your question, Pearl. Well, what I will say broadly is that Africa is a priority for – the relationship with Africa is a priority for the Biden administration, but I certainly won’t get ahead of any meetings and don’t have anything to share for you at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Casey O’Neill.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-BURMA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, hi, Jalina. Thanks so much for doing this. I – my question is actually on Myanmar. So I know today – earlier today, excuse me – Deputy Secretary Sherman in Bangkok delivered some remarks and spoke about the two American journalists that are detained in Myanmar, Danny Fenster and Nathan Maung. Their – excuse me – Mr. Fenster’s family has also been making the rounds on television and spoke earlier this morning and said that the United States Government has requested consular access, but so far that request has not been addressed by the military junta in Myanmar. So I’m just wondering if you could provide us any update on steps that the U.S. Government is taking to ensure that these two detained journalists are safe and if you have any update on whether or not the embassy personnel have been able to gain consular access to them. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks for your question, Casey. Well, I’ll start off by saying that the safety and safe return of U.S. citizens is a priority for the United States. At this time we have nothing to announce or any updates about these two specific cases.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Rosiland Jordan.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-CHINA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Jalina. Thanks for taking my call. I have two questions. One: The anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre is coming up. Is the U.S. sending a message to Beijing about how its security forces should handle themselves on this anniversary, both in mainland China and in Hong Kong?</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-IRAN"></a> And the other question has to do with, one, the sinking of an Iranian oil tanker, the <em>Kharg</em>, in the Gulf of Oman, was – does the U.S. have any more information about whether this was an accident or perhaps an act of sabotage? And connected to that, does the U.S. have any more updates on the travel of two Iranian warships that rumor – that the rumors suggest may be heading to Venezuela? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Rosiland. I’ll start with your first question on Tiananmen, and I’ll start by broadly saying that the United States condemns actions by Hong Kong authorities that prompted organizers to close the June 4th Museum that commemorates the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. As far as your question of sending any particular messages, no, we’re not sending any direct messages at this time, other than saying that Hong Kong and Beijing authorities continue to silence dissenting voices by also attempting to erase the horrific massacre from history.</p>
<p>And to your question on Iran, speaking of the naval ships on the Gulf of Oman, well, we’ve definitely seen the media reports on the Iranian naval vessels that have caught fire and have sank. Other than that, we don’t have anything to announce at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Rich Edson.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-WORLDHEALTHASSEMBLY"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Jalina, just looking into the conclusion of the World Health Assembly, there is really no sense of a phase two investigation or commitment to one, Taiwan was excluded from the proceedings, Syria and Belarus are now on the executive committee. I was just wondering if you could provide what the State Department’s assessment of the proceedings were and how the U.S. plans on attempting to follow through with reforms of the World Health Organization.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Rich. What I’ll say is to your point about countries that you’ve mentioned. We have grave concerns that Syria and Belarus have been elected for a three-year term by the World Health Assembly Executive Board. Members of the executive board each have a duty to advance public health and likewise are expected to uphold universal values as well as human rights. And, of course, this would include providing access for delivery of lifesaving humanitarian supplies, and that would include medical equipment as well. <a id="post-248345-_Hlk73544881"></a>We don’t believe the actions of either Syria or Belarus demonstrate this, and although the U.S. is not currently part of the executive board, we’ll continue to monitor closely the board’s activities and make clear that – U.S. exemptions<sup><a id="post-248345-footnote-ref-3" href="#post-248345-footnote-3"></a></sup> that the board members uphold the highest standards of human rights.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Laura Rozen.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-IRAN1"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have anything on the latest round of Iran talks in Vienna, which I think are wrapping up right now.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Laura. So the delegation led by Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley is currently in Vienna, and he’s in Vienna for a fifth round of talks. And any update to share that he actually may come back to Washington for consultations at the end of the week. Outside of that, I’d just underscore that these last few rounds of discussion have actually helped crystallize the choices that need to be made by Iran, and also by us, the United States, in order to achieve a mutual return to compliance of the JCPOA.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Soyoung Kim, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> About North Korea, Deputy Secretary Sherman said today that the U.S. has made its policy known to the DPRK. Can you clarify whether this means the U.S. recently reached out to North Korea again or the separate contact made a few months ago the Department of State had confirmed before? And any response from North Korea?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Hi, thanks for the question. I won’t get ahead of Deputy Secretary Sherman’s comments, and any other update we’ll be able to preview at a later time but nothing’s going out today.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Said Arikat.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Said’s line has left the queue.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> All right. With that, let’s go to Michel Ghandour, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I have two questions on Iran. Sources in Vienna said that the parties reached a draft agreement. Can you confirm that? And any comment on the fire in Tehran’s refinery today?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks for your question. Nothing to announce. I’m not able to confirm the reports of a fire in Tehran today, but just to underscore what was mentioned previously, our Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley, he’s currently in Vienna for his fifth round of talks and should be coming back to Washington sometime later this week. Anything beyond that and the decisions and the discussions that have been made, I have nothing to announce.</p>
<p>Looks like we have Said Arikat back in the queue. We’ll go to Said.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Thank you, Jalina. And I also want to thank you for mentioning my good friend, Tejinder. May God bless his soul. We will miss him dearly. Jalina, I wanted to ask you about two issues: one, if you have any comment on a report by <em>The Washington Post</em> that Israel is preventing cancer patients from leaving Gaza through the Erez Crossing, if you have any comment on that. I also want to ask about the whereabouts of Mr. Hady Amr right now, and what is next on his agenda? What is he doing? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you for your question, Said. And again, to underscore, we definitely will all miss Tejinder and his spirit, and his vigor and his contributions to not only foreign affairs but journalism as well.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-_Hlk73546868"></a> To your first question on cancer, I certainly look forward to these reports and would have to get back to you specifically on that question. And I’d have to do the same for your question on Hady and what he’s doing. We don’t have anything to announce at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Lara Jakes.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> I do not see Lara Jakes’s line in queue.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Okay. Let’s go to the line of Jennifer Hansler.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> It looks like Jennifer’s line is not in queue either.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> All right. Let’s go to the line of Hiba Nasr.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. I have one question about Israel. First, we saw during Secretary Blinken’s visit to Israel two weeks ago, he extended an invitation to the Israeli president to visit Washington, and tomorrow that Israeli defense minister is visiting Washington. Did this administration extend an invitation to Prime Minister Netanyahu to visit Washington? And my second question is on Nord Stream 2; yesterday Republicans in the House sent a letter to Secretary Blinken expressing concern over the decision to – over the decision to apply a waiver to some sanctions. Do you have any comments on that?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thanks, Hiba, for your first question on extending an invitation – on invites. We have nothing at all to announce on that. And your second question on NS2, I’ll have to take that one back for you.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Claudia Uceda.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-COSTARICA"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. First is: How can Costa Rica help stop illegal immigration flow into the U.S.? What is the Secretary looking into specifically? And my second question is about Nicaragua. I would like a reaction to the fact that <a id="post-248345-NICARAGUA"></a>Nicaraguan prosecutors question and are investigating 16 independent journalists, and they are threatening them with a criminal investigation related to money laundering investigation into Violeta Chamorro, who is a prospective candidate. What’s your reaction to that? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thank you, Claudia. So to your first question, I won’t get into specifics on what Costa Rica should be doing when it comes to the fight for regular migration, but I will say that Costa Rica honestly is a top partner of the United States and it has a strong democracy. And we do have shared values as well as shared commitments. And part of that is championing human rights across the board, and that will be integral into fighting that common challenge together. To your second question, I’ll just say broadly speaking that the United States supports the freedom of the press and will continue to champion that not only in Nicaragua but all over the world.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Nick Wadhams.</p>
<p><a id="post-248345-IRAN2"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Inaudible) press you a tiny bit more on Iran. In the past, you guys have said that there had been progress in the talks, though a lot of differences remained, and the U.S. and Iran were sort of closer to the start of the talks than they were toward the end of the talks. So do you believe that progress continues to be made? Have those talks stalled? And do you feel that the two sides are gradually inching closer to a resolution? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Well, certainly some progress has been made, and like I said, Rob Malley is in Vienna. He’ll be returning to Washington pretty soon. And again, talks are ongoing. And they will continue at a pace that’s honestly appropriate to address the significance of the issues that are currently on the table being negotiated right now. And I’ll continue to underscore that discussions like this are always thorough. They’re thoughtful. They’re businesslike even though they are indirect. And of course that’s to be expected. This isn’t going to be a quick or easy process.</p>
<p>It looks like we have Jennifer Hansler back on the line, so I’ll take that last question from her.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hello.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Hi, Jennifer.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi, Jalina. Thanks so much for taking my question. Just a little more on Iran, can you confirm that the indirect talks will resume next week? And then separately, has there been any communication with Russia in the wake of the latest cyber-attack on JBS? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thanks for your questions, Jennifer. To your first one, I don’t have anything to announce of any – for any future talks. And the second question, we’ll have to take that one back for you.</p>
<p>And thank you all very much for joining today’s briefing. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:29 p.m.)</p>
