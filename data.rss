					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Sde Boker</p>
<p>Kedma Hotel</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>Good afternoon, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.  We are starting now the last chapter of the Negev Summit, which are the press statements by all six foreign ministers.  First to address us is our host, Foreign Minister of the State of Israel His Excellency Yair Lapid.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LAPID:  </b>Thank you, my friend Secretary of State Tony Blinken, Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed, Foreign Minister Abdullatif Al Zayani, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, and Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita.</p>
<p>Last night, for the second time in a week, terror struck in the heart of Israel – at the heart of Israel in two senses: in the heart of the country in a crowded city, and also in the heart of every Israeli citizen.  This was murder for the sake of murder, terror for the sake of terror.  These terrorists fired in every direction with one goal: to kill as many innocent people as possible, to shed as much blood as possible.  I send my condolences to the families of the murdered and my wishes for the full and speedy recovery of the wounded.  Our thoughts and prayers are with them today.</p>
<p>Shortly after the attack, Islamic Jihad and Hamas praised it.  They declared that it was a response to the Negev Summit we are holding here.  The terrorists’ goal is to intimidate us, to make us afraid to meet and to build relationships and the agreements between us.  They will not succeed; we will not let them.  We have no intention of rewarding terrorists.  We have no intention of letting them dictate our lives or our policies.  Israel is a strong and a proud country and will never surrender to terror.  We will continue on our path, the path of peace.</p>
<p>I am not alone in this.  Everyone here shares this sentiment.  Last night, all the foreign ministers participating in the summit condemned with one strong voice the horrific terror attack.  On behalf of the people of Israel, I thank you for this.</p>
<p>My friends, Israel’s founding father, David Ben Gurion, who is buried two minutes away from here, once said history is isn’t written, history is made.  What we are doing here is making history, building a new regional architecture based on progress, technology, religious tolerance, security, and intelligence cooperation.  This new architecture, the shared capabilities we are building, intimidates and deters our common enemies, first and foremost Iran and its proxies. They certainly have something to fear.  What will stop them is not hesitation or being conciliatory, but rather determination and strength.</p>
<p>Friends, we are standing here in the Negev where our common father went after signing the original Abraham Accords between him and the Lord.  In the book of Genesis, it is written:  Then Abram set out and continued towards the Negev.  He came here to build a better future for his people and his family, and we are here for the same reason.</p>
<p>The history of the Middle East is the story of smart and tough people who made the desert bloom.  Our peoples are those who stopped right here and said, in this place, in this desert, we will make life flourish.  From this desert will spring forth palaces and temples, schools and hospitals, inspirational art and literature, and groundbreaking technology.  This meeting is the first of its kind, but not the last.</p>
<p>Last night, we decided to make the Negev Summit into a permanent forum.  Together with our  closest friend and ally, the United States, we are today opening a door before all the peoples of the region, including the Palestinians, and offering them to replace the way of terror and destruction with shared future of progress and success.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>Thank you, Minister Lapid.  Next to address us, Secretary of State of the United States Antony Blinken.  Please, sir.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you.  Let me begin by joining Yair and all of my colleagues in condemning the horrific terrorist attack last night in Hadera, which killed two border police officers, both just 19 years old.  On behalf of President Biden, the American people, we extend our heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of the victims, Yazan Fallah and Shirel Aboukaret.  No family should have to experience such loss, and we stand in absolute solidarity with our friends and partners against terrorism and these horrific acts of violence.  And indeed, Yair, as you said, what we are doing here is the exact counterpoint to this senseless destruction and violence.</p>
<p>It’s an honor to be here with you, with Minister Bourita, with Minister Al Zayani, Minister Zayed, Minister Shoukry – the foreign ministers of Israel, Morocco, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt – standing together in Israel.  Just a few years ago, this gathering would have been impossible to imagine.</p>
<p>You mentioned the original Abraham.  He had a dialogue with God.  He had the temerity sometimes to ask why.  We have the temerity, you have the temerity, to ask, why not?  That’s what this is about.  Since September 15<sup>th</sup>, 2020, when leaders from Israel, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates signed the Abraham Accords, and Morocco and Israel signed a normalization agreement soon after, once-impossible things have become possible.</p>
<p>We’ve seen democracy<a id="post-328858-footnote-ref-1" href="#post-328858-footnote-1"></a> flourish, with Morocco and Israel agreeing to open embassies in Rabat and Tel Aviv; Prime Minister Bennett becoming the first Israeli prime minister to visit Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates; and last week, the leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Egypt meeting to launch new areas of cooperation.  We’ve seen growing economic ties, with Bahrain and Israel signing more than a dozen agreements, including on aviation, on banking, on technology; government and business leaders from Morocco and Israel meeting last week to promote tourism across both countries; a solar energy deal that will accelerate the green energy transition already underway in the region.</p>
<p>At the heart of these interactions are people, people eager to learn about and from one another.  Student exchanges are flourishing between Rabat and Tal Aviv.  A Holocaust memorial exhibition is now opened in Dubai.  Hospitals in Bahrain and Israel are teaming up on cancer research.  Tomorrow, soccer players from – or football players from your countries will play in the Abraham Accords festival and games at the Dubai Expo, where there’s also an Israel pavilion.</p>
<p>The Abraham Accords are making the lives of people across your countries more peaceful, more prosperous, more vibrant, more integrated.  They’re allowing governments to focus their energies and attentions on the issues that are actually affecting the lives of our citizens and making them better.  The United States has and will continue to strongly support a process that is transforming this region and beyond.  We’ll help to strengthen the bonds between Israel and its circle of friends, both those with which it has normalization agreements and those with which it has longstanding peace treaties, like Egypt and Jordan.</p>
<p>To name one example, later today officials from the United States, the UAE, and Israel will launch the Religious Coexistence Working Group to counter intolerance and promote understanding.  And we’ll help widen the circle of friendship to include other countries interested in securing greater peace and prosperity for their own people.  As we do, we have to be clear that these regional peace agreements are not a substitute for progress between Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
<p>One of the issues we discussed today was how countries involved in the Abraham Accords and normalization, as well as those that have longstanding diplomatic relationships with Israel, can support the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people in concrete ways and have a positive impact on the daily lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.  This is a conversation we’ll carry forward so that we can work toward our goal of Palestinians and Israelis enjoying equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, and dignity, and create the conditions for a negotiated two-state solution.  Finally, as neighbors, and in the case of the United States, as friends, we will also work together to confront common security challenges and threats, including those from Iran and its proxies.</p>
<p>Almost exactly 43 years ago, Israel and Egypt concluded the Camp David Accords.  At that time, standing between President Sadat and President<a id="post-328858-footnote-ref-2" href="#post-328858-footnote-2"></a> Begin, President Carter said this:  “We are privileged to witness…a significant achievement in the cause of peace, an achievement  none thought possible  a year ago.”  Well, those were different times.  Israel and its neighbors had just fought a war.  But that sentiment – that what was believed unchangeable was suddenly transformed, creating a new reality – this is also true today.  And as happens whenever you break down barriers that have long kept people from interacting, exchanging ideas, working together, it’s impossible to anticipate all the new directions that this can take us.  This is a new dawn.  The only limits are the ones we can imagine.</p>
<p>So I commend the courage of those willing to break down barriers, political leaders but also people across our societies, individual citizens who are forging new relationships as a result of this historic opening.  I am excited to see all that you and we can imagine and create together for one another, for the region, for the world.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Now I invite His Excellency Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani, minister of foreign affairs of the Kingdom of Bahrain, to address us.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER AL ZAYANI:  </b>Thank you.  Your Highness, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it has been my great pleasure to participate in this distinguished gathering.  And I want to start by thanking Foreign Minister Lapid for the invitation. and indeed for the hospitality.</p>
<p>I would like to start by condemning the terrorist attack which took place last night, claiming the lives of two border policemen.  And I would like to convey our condolences to the bereaved families and reaffirm our firm stance against terrorism in all its forms.</p>
<p>I join you here on behalf of the Kingdom of Bahrain, a nation which has always been convinced in the importance of peace, dialogue, coexistence, and mutual respect, principles which are fully reflected and embodied in the vision of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and the policies implemented by the government led by His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa.</p>
<p>This is an important and timely meeting, and an opportunity to build on the historic 2020 Abraham Accords with a huge scope for growing the region’s prosperity, safeguarding its security, and realizing the aspirations of all its peoples.  The need to do so is made more urgent by recent developments such as the Houthi terrorist militia’s continued attacks on civilian energy infrastructure, the ongoing threat from terrorist organizations such as Hizballah and other proxy groups, and the need to resolve the Iranian nuclear file.</p>
<p>So we need to put into practice the principles behind the accords, namely those of dialogue, cooperation, and mutual respect.  We need to establish genuine, sustainable coexistence and interdependence between participants, building genuine networks of cooperation and trust to advance our common security and prosperity.  By doing so, we will demonstrate to the whole region what can be achieved by working together and show how, collectively, we can overcome shared regional challenges and seize opportunities in a way that would not – possible individually.  Of course, part of this process will be renewed efforts to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and Bahrain continues to urge both parties to come together and negotiate a resolution that establishes a viable state for the Palestinians and protects the security and interests of all parties.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, in the Kingdom of Bahrain, we have moved quickly to build on the Abraham Accords and to rapidly expand our relationship with the state of Israel.  We see great potential for cooperation across all fields.  And over the past 18 months, we have already seen how this potential can be realized.  This forum is therefore an important step in deepening and strengthening these bilateral ties, but also in expanding multilateral cooperation and interdependence among all countries.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken, in this context, I would like to thank the United States of America for their support to the Abraham Accords and for their continued commitment to the security of the region.  And once again, thank you, Minister Lapid, for hosting this gathering and for these warm and constructive discussions.  And I very much look forward to our next meeting and to building further on what we have achieved today.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Thank you very much, Excellency.  I now invite His Excellency Sameh Shoukry, minister of foreign affairs of Egypt, to address us.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:</b>  Minister Lapid, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all convey our appreciation to Minister Lapid for having convened these consultations.  They are – I think can be characterized by having been constructive and in-depth, and do address the various challenges that our region faces, turbulence related to regional and international conditions.  And we do so, the day before yesterday, having commemorated, as Secretary Blinken has referred to, the 43rd anniversary of the peace between Egypt and Israel, and we see constructive development in the normalization of relations and believe that the path that we set upon 43 years ago is coming to greater fruition and recognition of the importance and the viability of comprehensive peace and security for our region.</p>
<p>This round of discussions has given us an opportunity to highlight views related to how we can further progress in achieving our common objectives, and it certainly did during these discussions.  We did highlight the importance of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the importance of maintaining the credibility and the viability of the two-state solution that – for Israel and a Palestinian state to live side by side in peace with recognized borders for a Palestinian state in accordance with the ’67 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital.</p>
<p>This is an important issue, and Egypt has been striving over the years to facilitate and to assist both Israel and the Palestinians to reach the necessary accommodation and compromise that can facilitate an end of the conflict, and thereby open broader doors of regional cooperation, integration, and the benefits for the peoples of the region.  And of course, we do so in collaboration and with the assistance of our partner, the United States of America, and we value very much the coordination that exists and the common understanding related to the path and the way forward.</p>
<p>We certainly also consider and have on every occasion condemned all resort to violence, to terrorism, to incitement, and believe that it is our role as members of the international community but also as Arab states, states where there is a Muslim majority, as President al-Sisi has always declared, that we need to address the religious narrative and to confront extremism and terrorism and thereby provide peace and security for our region.  Also, the importance of addressing the issue of extra-regional intervention and the negative impact on the security and stability of our region.  We believe that we have the resources and the ability to meet those challenges with the help of our partners in the United States, and we’ll continue to seek areas of cooperation that provide for our protection of our national security interests within a peaceful and cooperative framework.</p>
<p>On all of these fronts, I think we have demonstrated our predictability, the dependence, the longevity of our peace with Israel, and that we are partners that can be depended on, and thereby we seek to enhance the areas of cooperation and interaction that can bring benefit to the region and to international peace and security.  For all of these reasons, we look forward to continuing this dialogue and to reaching a understanding and a consensus of how best to deal with the very many issues.  And here again, I think it is going to be incumbent and important on the short term to deal with the pressures that might arise and the importance of restricting any unilateral activity that might agitate the current situation and have an impact on the tranquility during a very sensitive and important time where we hope we can all direct our attention towards a higher cause rather than having to deal with crisis management.</p>
<p>I thank you again for the opportunity and I welcome this dialogue.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Thank you very much, Your Excellency.  I now have the pleasure of inviting His Excellency Mr. Nasser Bourita, Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccan Expatriates of the Kingdom of Morocco.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:</b>  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Please, sir.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:</b>  I would like to start by reiterating Morocco’s strong condemnation of the terrorist attacks of yesterday in Hadera and present our sincere condolences to the victims and our wish of recovery to all the injured.  Our presence today is, I think, the best response to such attacks.</p>
<p>I’m very delighted to be here in Negev in this very historic and timely Negev Summit, or, I should say, first Negev Summit.  And I would like to thank you, Yair, for the invitation, for choosing this very nice venue, and for the hospitality.</p>
<p>I would like also to thank you, Tony, for the presence, for the involvement, for the commitment.  The United States has been a reliable partner in promoting peace, and your personal commitment to this endeavor is very important to us.</p>
<p>Morocco’s presence here under instructions of His Majesty King Mohammed VI is meant to send two messages.  The first one is to our host and to the people of Israel.  As His Majesty King Mohammed VI said when we established the relations, this is not an opportunistic move.  It’s a move of conviction.  It’s a natural decision based on these longstanding relations between Morocco, Israel, and the kings of Morocco, and the Moroccan-Jewish community.</p>
<p>You are saying here that maybe every Israeli has in his family someone with Moroccan blood.  It’s not only a joke; it’s a reality.  I learned that two of the mayors of the main cities in the Negev, in Dimona and in Yeruham, are from Moroccan origin.  And this shows this very close ties between the kingdom and the population here.</p>
<p>Since the signing of the trilateral declaration in December, I think we have achieved a lot: visits, direct flights, agreements, and connecting people, which is also very important.  Very soon there will be a formal bilateral visit in which I think we will strengthen more our relations, including the diplomatic presence of Morocco here in Israel.</p>
<p>The second message is to the region, and I think we are here today because we genuinely, sincerely, and deeply believe in peace – not that kind of passive peace where we turn our backs to each other and peacefully ignore each other, but rather we believe in a thorough, fruitful, paradigm-shaping, and value-creating peace, the only kind of peace that is a battle worth waging.  And I think our presence is a message to that, a message to our people and a message to the people of the region.</p>
<p>We are here to create and to strengthen a positive dynamic, to create a different narrative about the relations between our people.  And I’m coming from a country with a longstanding coexistence between people from different faiths.  And if that’s more than has been successful in Morocco for centuries, it can also be possibly here in this region.</p>
<p>This dynamic is not just diplomatic; it should be tangible.  It should be felt by the people, and it should go into concrete, positive action which improve the lives of the people and open new horizons for the youth in our region.  And that’s why we are here.</p>
<p>We are here also to be a force of peace, and first to show that for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict a solution is possible, and for His Majesty King Mohammed VI, the position is constant.  We are for a two-state solution, living side by side with a Palestinian state in the borders of ’67 with East Jerusalem as capital, and a solution which will preserve the security and the interests of Israel.</p>
<p>I think a message to the region – a positive one, but also a message to those who are enemies of this positive dynamic – here in your region, also in North Africa, acting directly or through their proxies, our message should be that we are here to defend our values, to defend our interests, and that we are creating a shield to protect this positive dynamic.</p>
<p>I think there should be a spirit of Negev, a spirit which is coexistence, which is tangible results, and which is building for peace and challenging positively those who are the enemies of this peace.</p>
<p>I hope we will meet very soon in a different desert, but with the same spirit.  I thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Thank you very much, Your Excellency.  I know have the honor to present His Highness Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation of the United Arab Emirates, to address us.  His Highness, please.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER ABDULLAH BIN ZAYED:</b>  Let me start by thanking our host.  And Yair, you are not only a partner; you are a friend.  And we are so grateful for your kind hospitality, words, but also let me thank everyone here.  It just tells us all how much of a historic moment this is for everyone on the stage, but everyone in this room and beyond.</p>
<p>Forty-three years ago, when Egypt and Israel made peace, unfortunately we lost those 43 years of knowing each other better, of working together, and of changing the narrative that many generations of Israelis and Arabs have been living.  I think what we are trying to achieve here today is changing the narrative, creating a different future, and building on better hope for us and for our kids and grandkids.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s new for, I think, Abdullatif and Nasser and myself to be in Israel.  This is our first time.  So if we are curious sometimes and we want to know things and learn, it’s because although Israel has been part of this region for a very long time and – we’ve not known each other.  So it’s time to catch up, to build on a stronger relationship.  When I see 300,000 Israelis visiting the UAE in the last year and a half, but at the same time I see 2 million visitors visiting the Israeli pavilion in Expo in only the last six months, it says how curious and how much we want to know each other.</p>
<p>And this is what I think goes against what happened yesterday.  It’s by our standing together, it’s by our people-to-people relationship, it’s by creating a better environment for our businesses to work with each other – that’s the way we can go after the narrative of hate, of incitement, of terror.  We will prevail, no doubt.  It’s going to cost us, but it matters.  It matters to us, and we can do better on so many areas that either were mentioned in this gathering or mentioned today or yesterday.  It’s clear to me that there is a huge potential and everyone is excited about it.</p>
<p>And some – Egypt showed us leadership 43 years ago.  Thank you for that.  We are just trying to follow your footsteps.  And Tony, your presence here means a great deal, the United States not only being here but encouraging us to do more and building for a better, stable, and prosperous future for all.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Thank you, Your Highness.  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the first Negev Summit.  I would like to thank all of our guest, excellencies, and their delegations for coming here to Israel, to the Negev – and hoping for many more Negev summits.  Thank you.  <i>Toda raba</i>.  <i>Shukran</i>.  (Applause.)</p>

<p>To name one example, later today officials from the United States, the UAE, and Israel will launch the Religious Coexistence Working Group to counter intolerance and promote understanding.  And we’ll help widen the circle of friendship to include other countries interested in securing greater peace and prosperity for their own people.  As we do, we have to be clear that these regional peace agreements are not a substitute for progress between Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
<p>One of the issues we discussed today was how countries involved in the Abraham Accords and normalization, as well as those that have longstanding diplomatic relationships with Israel, can support the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people in concrete ways and have a positive impact on the daily lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.  This is a conversation we’ll carry forward so that we can work toward our goal of Palestinians and Israelis enjoying equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, and dignity, and create the conditions for a negotiated two-state solution.  Finally, as neighbors, and in the case of the United States, as friends, we will also work together to confront common security challenges and threats, including those from Iran and its proxies.</p>
<p>Almost exactly 43 years ago, Israel and Egypt concluded the Camp David Accords.  At that time, standing between President Sadat and President<a id="post-328858-footnote-ref-2" href="#post-328858-footnote-2"></a> Begin, President Carter said this:  “We are privileged to witness…a significant achievement in the cause of peace, an achievement  none thought possible  a year ago.”  Well, those were different times.  Israel and its neighbors had just fought a war.  But that sentiment – that what was believed unchangeable was suddenly transformed, creating a new reality – this is also true today.  And as happens whenever you break down barriers that have long kept people from interacting, exchanging ideas, working together, it’s impossible to anticipate all the new directions that this can take us.  This is a new dawn.  The only limits are the ones we can imagine.</p>
<p>So I commend the courage of those willing to break down barriers, political leaders but also people across our societies, individual citizens who are forging new relationships as a result of this historic opening.  I am excited to see all that you and we can imagine and create together for one another, for the region, for the world.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Now I invite His Excellency Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani, minister of foreign affairs of the Kingdom of Bahrain, to address us.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER AL ZAYANI:  </b>Thank you.  Your Highness, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it has been my great pleasure to participate in this distinguished gathering.  And I want to start by thanking Foreign Minister Lapid for the invitation. and indeed for the hospitality.</p>
<p>I would like to start by condemning the terrorist attack which took place last night, claiming the lives of two border policemen.  And I would like to convey our condolences to the bereaved families and reaffirm our firm stance against terrorism in all its forms.</p>
<p>I join you here on behalf of the Kingdom of Bahrain, a nation which has always been convinced in the importance of peace, dialogue, coexistence, and mutual respect, principles which are fully reflected and embodied in the vision of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and the policies implemented by the government led by His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa.</p>
<p>This is an important and timely meeting, and an opportunity to build on the historic 2020 Abraham Accords with a huge scope for growing the region’s prosperity, safeguarding its security, and realizing the aspirations of all its peoples.  The need to do so is made more urgent by recent developments such as the Houthi terrorist militia’s continued attacks on civilian energy infrastructure, the ongoing threat from terrorist organizations such as Hizballah and other proxy groups, and the need to resolve the Iranian nuclear file.</p>
<p>So we need to put into practice the principles behind the accords, namely those of dialogue, cooperation, and mutual respect.  We need to establish genuine, sustainable coexistence and interdependence between participants, building genuine networks of cooperation and trust to advance our common security and prosperity.  By doing so, we will demonstrate to the whole region what can be achieved by working together and show how, collectively, we can overcome shared regional challenges and seize opportunities in a way that would not – possible individually.  Of course, part of this process will be renewed efforts to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and Bahrain continues to urge both parties to come together and negotiate a resolution that establishes a viable state for the Palestinians and protects the security and interests of all parties.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, in the Kingdom of Bahrain, we have moved quickly to build on the Abraham Accords and to rapidly expand our relationship with the state of Israel.  We see great potential for cooperation across all fields.  And over the past 18 months, we have already seen how this potential can be realized.  This forum is therefore an important step in deepening and strengthening these bilateral ties, but also in expanding multilateral cooperation and interdependence among all countries.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken, in this context, I would like to thank the United States of America for their support to the Abraham Accords and for their continued commitment to the security of the region.  And once again, thank you, Minister Lapid, for hosting this gathering and for these warm and constructive discussions.  And I very much look forward to our next meeting and to building further on what we have achieved today.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Thank you very much, Excellency.  I now invite His Excellency Sameh Shoukry, minister of foreign affairs of Egypt, to address us.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER SHOUKRY:</b>  Minister Lapid, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all convey our appreciation to Minister Lapid for having convened these consultations.  They are – I think can be characterized by having been constructive and in-depth, and do address the various challenges that our region faces, turbulence related to regional and international conditions.  And we do so, the day before yesterday, having commemorated, as Secretary Blinken has referred to, the 43rd anniversary of the peace between Egypt and Israel, and we see constructive development in the normalization of relations and believe that the path that we set upon 43 years ago is coming to greater fruition and recognition of the importance and the viability of comprehensive peace and security for our region.</p>
<p>This round of discussions has given us an opportunity to highlight views related to how we can further progress in achieving our common objectives, and it certainly did during these discussions.  We did highlight the importance of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the importance of maintaining the credibility and the viability of the two-state solution that – for Israel and a Palestinian state to live side by side in peace with recognized borders for a Palestinian state in accordance with the ’67 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital.</p>
<p>This is an important issue, and Egypt has been striving over the years to facilitate and to assist both Israel and the Palestinians to reach the necessary accommodation and compromise that can facilitate an end of the conflict, and thereby open broader doors of regional cooperation, integration, and the benefits for the peoples of the region.  And of course, we do so in collaboration and with the assistance of our partner, the United States of America, and we value very much the coordination that exists and the common understanding related to the path and the way forward.</p>
<p>We certainly also consider and have on every occasion condemned all resort to violence, to terrorism, to incitement, and believe that it is our role as members of the international community but also as Arab states, states where there is a Muslim majority, as President al-Sisi has always declared, that we need to address the religious narrative and to confront extremism and terrorism and thereby provide peace and security for our region.  Also, the importance of addressing the issue of extra-regional intervention and the negative impact on the security and stability of our region.  We believe that we have the resources and the ability to meet those challenges with the help of our partners in the United States, and we’ll continue to seek areas of cooperation that provide for our protection of our national security interests within a peaceful and cooperative framework.</p>
<p>On all of these fronts, I think we have demonstrated our predictability, the dependence, the longevity of our peace with Israel, and that we are partners that can be depended on, and thereby we seek to enhance the areas of cooperation and interaction that can bring benefit to the region and to international peace and security.  For all of these reasons, we look forward to continuing this dialogue and to reaching a understanding and a consensus of how best to deal with the very many issues.  And here again, I think it is going to be incumbent and important on the short term to deal with the pressures that might arise and the importance of restricting any unilateral activity that might agitate the current situation and have an impact on the tranquility during a very sensitive and important time where we hope we can all direct our attention towards a higher cause rather than having to deal with crisis management.</p>
<p>I thank you again for the opportunity and I welcome this dialogue.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Thank you very much, Your Excellency.  I now have the pleasure of inviting His Excellency Mr. Nasser Bourita, Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccan Expatriates of the Kingdom of Morocco.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:</b>  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Please, sir.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:</b>  I would like to start by reiterating Morocco’s strong condemnation of the terrorist attacks of yesterday in Hadera and present our sincere condolences to the victims and our wish of recovery to all the injured.  Our presence today is, I think, the best response to such attacks.</p>
<p>I’m very delighted to be here in Negev in this very historic and timely Negev Summit, or, I should say, first Negev Summit.  And I would like to thank you, Yair, for the invitation, for choosing this very nice venue, and for the hospitality.</p>
<p>I would like also to thank you, Tony, for the presence, for the involvement, for the commitment.  The United States has been a reliable partner in promoting peace, and your personal commitment to this endeavor is very important to us.</p>
<p>Morocco’s presence here under instructions of His Majesty King Mohammed VI is meant to send two messages.  The first one is to our host and to the people of Israel.  As His Majesty King Mohammed VI said when we established the relations, this is not an opportunistic move.  It’s a move of conviction.  It’s a natural decision based on these longstanding relations between Morocco, Israel, and the kings of Morocco, and the Moroccan-Jewish community.</p>
<p>You are saying here that maybe every Israeli has in his family someone with Moroccan blood.  It’s not only a joke; it’s a reality.  I learned that two of the mayors of the main cities in the Negev, in Dimona and in Yeruham, are from Moroccan origin.  And this shows this very close ties between the kingdom and the population here.</p>
<p>Since the signing of the trilateral declaration in December, I think we have achieved a lot: visits, direct flights, agreements, and connecting people, which is also very important.  Very soon there will be a formal bilateral visit in which I think we will strengthen more our relations, including the diplomatic presence of Morocco here in Israel.</p>
<p>The second message is to the region, and I think we are here today because we genuinely, sincerely, and deeply believe in peace – not that kind of passive peace where we turn our backs to each other and peacefully ignore each other, but rather we believe in a thorough, fruitful, paradigm-shaping, and value-creating peace, the only kind of peace that is a battle worth waging.  And I think our presence is a message to that, a message to our people and a message to the people of the region.</p>
<p>We are here to create and to strengthen a positive dynamic, to create a different narrative about the relations between our people.  And I’m coming from a country with a longstanding coexistence between people from different faiths.  And if that’s more than has been successful in Morocco for centuries, it can also be possibly here in this region.</p>
<p>This dynamic is not just diplomatic; it should be tangible.  It should be felt by the people, and it should go into concrete, positive action which improve the lives of the people and open new horizons for the youth in our region.  And that’s why we are here.</p>
<p>We are here also to be a force of peace, and first to show that for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict a solution is possible, and for His Majesty King Mohammed VI, the position is constant.  We are for a two-state solution, living side by side with a Palestinian state in the borders of ’67 with East Jerusalem as capital, and a solution which will preserve the security and the interests of Israel.</p>
<p>I think a message to the region – a positive one, but also a message to those who are enemies of this positive dynamic – here in your region, also in North Africa, acting directly or through their proxies, our message should be that we are here to defend our values, to defend our interests, and that we are creating a shield to protect this positive dynamic.</p>
<p>I think there should be a spirit of Negev, a spirit which is coexistence, which is tangible results, and which is building for peace and challenging positively those who are the enemies of this peace.</p>
<p>I hope we will meet very soon in a different desert, but with the same spirit.  I thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Thank you very much, Your Excellency.  I know have the honor to present His Highness Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation of the United Arab Emirates, to address us.  His Highness, please.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER ABDULLAH BIN ZAYED:</b>  Let me start by thanking our host.  And Yair, you are not only a partner; you are a friend.  And we are so grateful for your kind hospitality, words, but also let me thank everyone here.  It just tells us all how much of a historic moment this is for everyone on the stage, but everyone in this room and beyond.</p>
<p>Forty-three years ago, when Egypt and Israel made peace, unfortunately we lost those 43 years of knowing each other better, of working together, and of changing the narrative that many generations of Israelis and Arabs have been living.  I think what we are trying to achieve here today is changing the narrative, creating a different future, and building on better hope for us and for our kids and grandkids.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s new for, I think, Abdullatif and Nasser and myself to be in Israel.  This is our first time.  So if we are curious sometimes and we want to know things and learn, it’s because although Israel has been part of this region for a very long time and – we’ve not known each other.  So it’s time to catch up, to build on a stronger relationship.  When I see 300,000 Israelis visiting the UAE in the last year and a half, but at the same time I see 2 million visitors visiting the Israeli pavilion in Expo in only the last six months, it says how curious and how much we want to know each other.</p>
<p>And this is what I think goes against what happened yesterday.  It’s by our standing together, it’s by our people-to-people relationship, it’s by creating a better environment for our businesses to work with each other – that’s the way we can go after the narrative of hate, of incitement, of terror.  We will prevail, no doubt.  It’s going to cost us, but it matters.  It matters to us, and we can do better on so many areas that either were mentioned in this gathering or mentioned today or yesterday.  It’s clear to me that there is a huge potential and everyone is excited about it.</p>
<p>And some – Egypt showed us leadership 43 years ago.  Thank you for that.  We are just trying to follow your footsteps.  And Tony, your presence here means a great deal, the United States not only being here but encouraging us to do more and building for a better, stable, and prosperous future for all.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Thank you, Your Highness.  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the first Negev Summit.  I would like to thank all of our guest, excellencies, and their delegations for coming here to Israel, to the Negev – and hoping for many more Negev summits.  Thank you.  <i>Toda raba</i>.  <i>Shukran</i>.  (Applause.)</p>

<p>The President’s Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request includes $60.4 billion for the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), $1.9 billion or 3 percent above the Fiscal Year 2022 Request, and $7.4 billion or 14 percent above FY 2021 enacted levels.  Reflecting the priority that the Biden-Harris Administration places on global leadership, as well as the President’s belief that diplomacy and development are vital tools for advancing U.S. interests at home and abroad, the resources included in this Budget Request will advance the foreign policy agenda of the United States and deliver results for the American people.</p>
<p>At the Department of State and USAID, the Budget would:</p>

<p>The President’s Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Request includes $60.4 billion for the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), $1.9 billion or 3 percent above the Fiscal Year 2022 Request, and $7.4 billion or 14 percent above FY 2021 enacted levels.  Reflecting the priority that the Biden-Harris Administration places on global leadership, as well as the President’s belief that diplomacy and development are vital tools for advancing U.S. interests at home and abroad, the resources included in this Budget Request will advance the foreign policy agenda of the United States and deliver results for the American people.</p>
<p>At the Department of State and USAID, the Budget would:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support Ukraine and Our Allies and Partners in the Region</strong>:  The Request includes $1.6 billion to support Ukraine against Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified invasion and assist other countries across Europe and Central Asia threatened by regional insecurity. The Request provides significant assistance to our allies and partners while building their capacity to counter actions from malign actors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affirm U.S. Alliances and Renew U.S. International Leadership</strong>: The Request maintains longstanding commitments to key partners; advances peace, prosperity, and security across the Indo-Pacific and Europe; expands diplomatic and development initiatives in Africa and Asia; and positions us to effectively compete with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Russia. The Request includes $4 billion to support U.S. commitments to international organizations and affirms U.S. leadership at a moment when our competitors are seeking to expand their influence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Address the Climate Crisis</strong>: The Request has $2.3 billion to support U.S. leadership in addressing the existential climate crisis through diplomacy; scaled-up international climate programs that accelerate the global energy transition to net zero by 2050; support to developing countries to enhance climate resilience; and the prioritization of climate adaptation and sustainability principles in Department and USAID domestic and overseas facilities. This total includes over $1.6 billion for direct programming for climate mitigation and adaptation and over $650 million for the mainstreaming of climate considerations across development programs. Our goal is to deliver climate co-benefits and outcomes in sectors such as agriculture and food security, water and sanitation, and global health.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advance American Leadership in Global Health, Including Global Health Security and Infectious Disease Response and Preparedness</strong>: The Budget Request includes $10.6 billion to bolster U.S. leadership in the face of an enduring COVID-19 pandemic and other global health challenges, $525 million above the FY 2022 Request. U.S. leadership is critical to the Global Fund’s seventh replenishment, and we are supporting a $2 billion contribution this year with an intended pledge of $6 billion over three years, to save lives and continue the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and to support the Global Fund’s expanded response to COVID-19 and global health strengthening. This total also includes $1 billion to prevent, prepare for, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks, including the continued expansion of Global Health Security Agenda capacity-building programs and contributions for a multilateral financial intermediary fund for health security and pandemic preparedness.</li>
</ul>

In addition to Request for $60.4 billion in annual discretionary appropriations, the Budget includes $6.5 billion in mandatory funding for State and USAID over five years to make transformative investments in pandemic and other biological threat preparedness globally in support of U.S. biodefense and pandemic preparedness strategies and plans. The pandemic preparedness funding will strengthen the global health workforce, support pandemic preparedness research and development, advance global research and development capacity, and support health security financing to strengthen global capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to future COVID variants and other infectious disease outbreaks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Address Food Insecurity and Foster Inclusive and Sustainable Agriculture-led Economic Growth</strong>: The conflict in Ukraine is exacerbating food insecurity around the world. In support of the President’s pledge to alleviate global food insecurity, we are providing over $1 billion in bilateral agriculture and food security programming. These investments are key to increasing access for communities, including those across Latin America, Africa, and Asia, to nutritious food, strengthening their resilience to shocks and stresses, and lifting them from entrenched poverty.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Champion an Open and Secure Digital and Technological Ecosystem</strong>: The Budget invests more than $350 million to expand reliable and affordable internet access through the development and deployment of secure digital and technological infrastructure. The Budget will improve international cybersecurity practices and promote the adoption of policies that support an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable internet.

State and USAID will also seek to close the digital gender gap in low- and middle-income countries by increasing women and girls’ access to information communication technologies and address online harassment and abuse globally.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reinvigorate U.S. Leadership in International Institutions</strong>: The Budget requests $4 billion, including an increase of nearly $400 million, to reduce peacekeeping arrears, continue the Administration’s efforts to lead through international organizations by meeting commitments to international organizations and pay contributions United Nations peacekeeping missions on time and in full. Strengthening international partnerships is critical to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, including global education, ending hunger and malnutrition, building more sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems, and addressing other global challenges.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defend Democracy Globally</strong>: In response to increasing authoritarianism around the world, the Request has more than $3.2 billion to advance democratization, protect universal human rights, bolster anti-corruption work, and increase programming that builds inclusive, legitimate, and effective governance – consistent with the commitments made during the President’s Summit for Democracy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revitalize Alliances and Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific</strong>: To strengthen and modernize America’s alliances and partnerships in a vital global region and affirm U.S. leadership in strategic competition, the Request includes $1.8 billion to implement the Indo-Pacific Strategy to support a free, open, connected, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific Region, and an additional $400 million for the Countering PRC Malign Influence Fund (CPMIF).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continue Collaborative U.S. Leadership in Central America and Haiti</strong>: As part of a comprehensive strategy to advance systemic reform while addressing the root causes of irregular migration from Central America to the United States, the Budget invests $986.8 million in the region towards the President’s commitment to provide $4 billion in assistance for Central America over four years. Also, in response to deteriorating conditions and widespread violence in Haiti, the Budget invests $274.8 million to support Haiti’s recovery from political and economic shocks, such as increasing the capacity of the Haitian National Police, combating corruption, strengthening the capacity of civil society, and supporting services for marginalized populations. These investments will ensure that the U.S. is able to revitalize partnerships that build economic resilience, democratic stability, and citizen security in the region.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support America’s Allies in the Middle East</strong>: The Budget fully supports the U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding for $3.3 billion in military assistance, provides up to $1.45 billion in economic and security assistance for Jordan, and includes $1.4 billion to support the U.S. diplomatic and security partnership with Egypt. As part of the Administration’s commitment to advancing security, prosperity, and freedom for both Israelis and Palestinians, the Budget includes $219 million for critical assistance to the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthen African Engagement</strong>: The Budget provides $7.8 billion for sub-Saharan Africa, including more than $250 million in support of the second U.S.-Africa Leaders’ Summit to strengthen ties with African partners based on principles of mutual respect and shared interests and values. These investments will strengthen collaboration, trade and investment, electrification, ecosystems for mutual growth and prosperity, and promote digital transformation in Africa.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthen U.S. Leadership on Refugee and Humanitarian Issues</strong>: The Budget provides $10.45 billion in State and USAID resources to respond to the unprecedented humanitarian need arising from conflict and natural disasters around the world to serve over 70 countries and approximately 240 million people. The Budget continues to rebuild and strengthen the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advance Equity and Equality Globally</strong>: The Budget provides $2.6 billion to advance gender equity and equality and to support underserved communities across a broad range of sectors. This includes $200 million for the Gender Equity and Equality Action (GEEA) Fund to advance the economic security of women and girls. This total also includes funding to strengthen the participation of women in conflict prevention, resolution, and recovery through the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security Act. To further implement the President’s Executive Order advancing racial equity and support for underserved communities, the Budget will better integrate equity through more inclusive policies, strategies, and practice including enhancing the ability of potential non-traditional partners to pursue federal opportunities and address the barriers they face in the federal award process, and new efforts to identify spaces to support and advance underserved population appropriate to the country context.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest in and Expand the Diplomatic and Development Workforce</strong>: The Budget will revitalize and expand the diplomatic and development workforce by providing $7.6 billion to recruit, retain, and develop the diverse, highly capable workforce needed to support efforts around the world and manage complex national security issues. It advances diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility across both agencies through increasing investment in diversifying the foreign affairs workforce to reflect and draw on the richness and diversity of the United States, including through targeted fellowship programs. It also strengthens the Department’s cybersecurity posture and secure communications capability.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustain Diplomatic and Embassy Security</strong>: The Budget will sustain Diplomatic and Embassy Security funding at $5.8 billion to keep our people, buildings, and information around the globe safe and secure. This includes funding for Anomalous Health Incident (AHI) monitoring and research, countering the emerging threat of drones to diplomatic facilities, and strengthening our cybersecurity against malign actors.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>In August 2021, as part of Vice President Kamala Harris’s trip to Singapore, the United States and Singapore agreed on the importance of creating a safe and transparent environment that facilitates space exploration, science, and commercial activities for all of humanity to enjoy. Vice President Harris and Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong discussed opportunities to expand bilateral cooperation in the field of space.</p>
<p>Today, as a product of that expanded dialogue and cooperation on space, Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong signed the Artemis Accords on behalf of the Republic of Singapore in a ceremony in Washington, DC.  This important statement of commitment to the peaceful and safe exploration of space was welcomed by Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary J.R. Littlejohn and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy.</p>
<p>Led by the Department of State and NASA, the Artemis Accords are grounded in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and promote values-based cooperation and encourage responsible and safe behavior in space.  These principles for space exploration also underpin NASA’s Artemis Program, which seeks to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon, while preparing to conduct a human mission to Mars.</p>
<p>Singapore is the 18th country to sign the Accords, joining Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  These nations are leading the world in operationalizing principles for the responsible exploration of space.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>President Biden believes deeply in the ability of U.S. global leadership to solve challenges, and the Administration recognizes that diplomacy and development are vital tools for advancing U.S. interests and values. That is why the Fiscal Year 2023 President’s Budget requests $60.4 billion for the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), $1.9 billion, or 3 percent, above the Fiscal Year 2022 Request, and $7.4 billion, or 14 percent, above FY 2021 enacted levels. With these resources, we can advance our foreign policy agenda and deliver for the American people.</p>
<p>The Budget will fund a range of Department of State and USAID priorities, including:</p>
<p><strong>Support for Ukraine and Our Allies and Partners in the Region</strong>: The Request includes $1.6 billion to support Ukraine against Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified invasion and assist other countries across Europe and Central Asia threatened by regional insecurity. The Request provides significant assistance to our allies and partners while building their capacity to counter actions from malign actors.</p>
<p><strong>Affirming U.S. Alliances and Renewing U.S. International Leadership</strong>: The Request maintains longstanding commitments to key partners; advances peace, prosperity, and security across the Indo-Pacific and Europe; expands diplomatic and development initiatives in Africa and Asia; and positions us to effectively compete with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Russia. This Request includes $4 billion to support U.S. commitments to international organizations and affirms U.S. leadership at a moment when our competitors are seeking to expand their influence.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing the Climate Crisis</strong>: The Request has $2.3 billion to support U.S. leadership in addressing the existential climate crisis through diplomacy; scaled-up international climate programs that accelerate the global energy transition to net zero by 2050; support to developing countries to enhance climate resilience; and the prioritization of climate adaptation and sustainability principles in Department and USAID domestic and overseas facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthening Global Health Systems</strong>: The United States is the international leader in advancing global health outcomes that benefit the American people and millions of others around the world. The Budget requests $10.6 billion in Department and USAID funding to continue to collaborate with international partners to invest in cross-cutting health systems to prevent child and maternal deaths, combat infectious diseases, and control HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>Revitalizing Alliances and Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific</strong>: To strengthen and modernize America’s alliances and partnerships in a vital global region and affirm U.S. leadership in strategic competition, the Request includes $1.8 billion to implement the Indo-Pacific Strategy to support a free, open, connected, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific Region, and an additional $400 million for the Countering PRC Malign Influence Fund (CPMIF).</p>

<p><strong>Promoting Gender Equity and Equality Worldwide</strong>: The Request includes $2.6 billion to advance gender equity and equality across a broad range of sectors, more than doubling such funding over the FY 2022 Budget. This entails $200 million for the Gender Equity and Equality Action (GEEA) Fund to advance the economic security of women and girls.</p>
<p><strong>Revitalizing and Expanding the Diplomatic and Development Workforce</strong>: This Request would equip the Department and USAID to continue to recruit, retain, and develop a diverse, dynamic, and highly capable workforce to tackle 21st century challenges. It advances diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility; supports professional development opportunities; and builds capacity in critical new areas such as cyberspace and emerging technology.</p>
<p>The Budget Request makes these smart investments while also reducing deficits and improving our country’s long-term fiscal outlook.</p>
<p>The State Department and USAID are also releasing today the new 2022-2026 Joint Strategic Plan (JSP), a four-year joint plan that serves as the primary State and USAID strategy for advancing our foreign policy and development priorities in both organizations. The JSP is organized around five goals, as reflected in the Request as well: renewing U.S. leadership and mobilizing coalitions to address the global challenges that have the greatest impact on Americans’ security and well-being; promoting global prosperity and shaping an international environment in which the United States can thrive; strengthening democratic institutions, upholding universal values, and promoting human dignity; revitalizing the diplomatic and development workforce and institutions, and serving U.S. citizens around the world and facilitating secure international travel.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the publication of the Joint Strategic Plan and in support of the <em>Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018, </em>the Department will release the 2022 Capacity Assessment for Research, Evaluation, Statistics and Other Analysis, and the Annual Evaluation Plan. The Department’s first enterprise–wide Learning Agenda will be released in April. Together these three documents will promote building evidence and learning in pursuit of the objectives detailed in the Joint Strategic Plan.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Ramallah, the West Bank </p>
<p>Muqata’a </p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT ABBAS: </strong>(Via interpreter)  In the name of God, the merciful, it gives me great pleasure to welcome U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in his visit to Palestine.  This was an opportunity for me to inform him of the recent developments here.  We also extended the thanks of the – to the administration for the support it provides to the Palestinian people, especially the UNRWA.</p>
<p>We would like to assert at the outset that the priority should always be towards finding a political solution that would end the Israeli occupation of the land of Palestine along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, and to resolve all permanent status issues, including the issues of the refugees and the release of all prisoners under the supervision and sponsorship of the Quartet and according to the – to international resolutions.</p>
<p>We would also like to stress that the state of Palestine abides by international law and all signed agreements, and is – also adheres to the path of peaceful popular resistance and working with the other countries and with the U.S. in – on combating terrorism in our region and the world.  On the other hand, we also stress the importance of the implementation of what the administration of President Biden believes in, which is its belief in a two-state solution and the putting an end to settlements and the violence of settlers, and maintaining the historical status in al-Aqsa Mosque and preventing unilateral actions inside, and also the reopening of the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, and the annulment of all American laws that consider the PLO a terrorist organization inciting violence.</p>
<p>The latest incidents in Europe have proven that there are double standards being flagrantly observed around the world.  For in spite of the crimes of the Israeli occupation that have reached a stage of ethnic cleansing and racial discrimination, as conceded by human rights organizations, and its continuous aggression against sanctities and a lack of respect for international law, we don’t find any party that would hold Israel accountable for its actions as it acts as a state above all law.  And the continuation of these Israeli unilateral actions will lead in the near future to a decision by the Palestinian central committee that would be implemented soon.  What is happening in Palestine is something that we cannot be silent about, and international law cannot be partitioned or divided.  And we here ask again, is it possible for the Israeli occupation authorities’ domination over the Palestinian people and the usurpation of its legitimate rights and dignity – can this continue without any other measures being taken in order to end this occupation?</p>
<p>So in conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Palestinian people for the success of the local elections that were held yesterday in an atmosphere of democracy.  And we had hoped that these elections were – could have happened also or taken place in Gaza Strip, but Hamas agreement with that, in spite of Hamas’s participation in elections in the West Bank.  We would like to express our sadness also for Israel’s prevention of the conduct of the presidential and legislative elections in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary, once again I welcome you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Mr. President, thank you.  Thank you for your hospitality and for the good exchange.  The United States is committed to rebuilding our relationship with the Palestinian Authority and with the Palestinian people.  We’ve been focused on concrete ways to help improve the lives of Palestinians.  That includes: rejoining UNRWA, half a billion dollars in humanitarian assistance since April of last year, and economic support to the Palestinian private sector, to small businesses, job training for young people, and support for food-insecure families in the West Bank and in Gaza.</p>
<p>But this support is more than simply economic.  We’re focused on advancing Palestinian civil and human rights, supporting civil society.  Indeed, I just met, as I think you know, with civil society leaders in East Jerusalem.  They are part of an incredibly rich mosaic that makes up the city.  With them, and here as well with the president and his team, we talked about the importance of responsive, responsible governance.  And at the heart of all of this is an ongoing, enduring commitment to the basic principle of the two-state solution.  Palestinians and Israelis alike deserve to live with equal measures of freedom, of opportunity, security, of dignity, and we believe that the most effective way, ultimately, to give expression to that basic principle is through two states.</p>
<p>Of course, the two sides are very far apart, so we’ll continue our work, step by step, to try to bring them closer.  We’ll work to prevent actions by either side that could raise tensions.  That includes settlement expansion, settler violence, home demolitions, evictions, payments to people convicted of terrorism, incitements to violence.  And today we also emphasized the imperative of having a peaceful Ramadan, Easter, Passover, all of which come together in a month’s time.</p>
<p>Mr. President, again I appreciate the opportunity to discuss all of this with you.  I’m grateful for your hospitality.  And we will continue to work together for the advancement of the lives and livelihoods of the Palestinian people.  We’re committed to that.</p>

<p>Jerusalem </p>
<p>America House Jerusalem </p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Welcome, everyone.  It’s very good to be here with you at the America House, and I’m really grateful for this opportunity to get a chance to hear from you as leaders of civil society here in Jerusalem.  Civil society is a critical pillar of any democracy, and as leaders, as advocates for the Palestinian community in Jerusalem, you’re playing an incredibly important role.  I know it’s also one that faces unique and, indeed, painful challenges.</p>
<p>You’re leading social organizations.  You’re running local businesses.  You’re representing families facing evictions and demolitions.  You’re lending your legal expertise to the peace process and bringing together Israelis and Palestinians through peaceful dialogue and cooperation.  I am eager to hear about the work that you’re doing, the challenges you’re facing, and how the United States can do more to support you in your efforts – something that we’re very committed to doing.</p>
<p>So to each and every one of you, welcome.  Thank you for being here and I’m looking forward to the conversation.  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Jerusalem</p>
<p>The David Citadel</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR NIDES:</strong>  Welcome, everybody.  Thank you all for coming.  This is a spectacular day.  Not only do I have my friend, a phenomenal Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, but this program is one of the highlights of this administration, which is the Nita Lowey Fund, which allows and has given and granted – Nita Lowey was a member of Congress who was a friend both of mine and the Secretary’s, and this was named after her – $250 million which will be going to partnerships.</p>
<p>But I want to just take a second to have Aler – are you there, Aler?</p>
<p><strong>MS GRUBBS:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR NIDES:</strong>  Who runs the USAID mission here in Israel and has done a spectacular job, to introduce the Secretary.  Aler.</p>
<p><strong>MS GRUBBS:</strong>  Good afternoon, and thank you to mark this event on the Nita Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act, which is also known as MEPPA.  And through MEPPA, this represents the United States commitment to supporting an eventual two-state solution and peaceful coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis.  The MEPPA will support building economic bridges between Palestinians and Israelis, as well as supporting people-to-people peace building.</p>
<p>On March 8th, the U.S. Government announced the first two grants under MEPPA, and it is a great honor to welcome the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken here today to make another announcement on MEPPA.  Please.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you so much.  Well, Tom, thank you so much.  First of all, I just want to say how grateful we are to be working every single day with USAID because what I see around the world is extraordinary work that AID is doing, and no more so than with this project with the State Department because it is literally bringing people and bringing communities together to meet shared challenges and to discover in the process that, ultimately, they have a lot more in common than separates them.  And that is the power of the MEPPA program.  It’s the power of the work that we’re doing, and with the grants that are being awarded, including one that will go to dealing with a common challenge faced by Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs alike, and that is water scarcity.</p>
<p>So in this way and so many other ways, through practical cooperation, bringing people together, it builds habits of cooperation and breaks down barriers in ways that ultimately, I think, will help set the foundation for what we continue to believe is the necessary and important future of two states.</p>
<p>So it’s an honor to be here today.  It’s an honor to see this get off the ground.  And I wish you all very good luck in actually pursuing this project.  Congratulations, as well.</p>
