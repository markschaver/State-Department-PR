					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And we are joined now by Secretary of State Antony Blinken for the latest on the crisis with Russia over Ukraine.  Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us again this morning.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Good morning, George.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>The Russians said again this morning that they’re continuing to pull back troops from the border.  Yesterday the President said he was skeptical about that.  Are you seeing any evidence that this is being done in a real and significant way?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>We’re not, and unfortunately there’s a difference between what Russia says and what it does, and what we’re seeing is no meaningful pullback.  On the contrary, we continue to see forces, especially forces that would be in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>We’re also – heard from the Kremlin spokesman this morning, Dmitry Peskov, saying that there still is a possibility that diplomacy can work, but that Russia is getting pretty tired of these threats and warnings from the President.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, the threats are coming in the other direction.  They’re coming from Russia – unprovoked, massing forces on Ukraine’s borders – but there always has to be an opening for diplomacy.  And in fact, that’s my job.  So we’ll pursue that.  And as the President said yesterday, we’re prepared either way.  We’re prepared if Russia is ready to actually engage in meaningful diplomacy that would strengthen everyone’s security in Europe.  We’re also prepared if they choose to renew aggression against Ukraine.  The choice is really President Putin’s.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Your intelligence has suggested that the invasion could actually come today. Does that still feel possible?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>We said that we were in a window of time at which the invasion could come at any time.  President Putin’s put in place the capacity to act on very short notice.  He can pull the trigger.  He could pull it today, he could pull it tomorrow, he could pull it next week.  The forces are there if he wants to renew aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>What’s the basis for a diplomatic solution right now?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Look, George, we shared ideas with Russia several weeks ago about ways on a reciprocal basis, with each side taking steps, we could actually improve security throughout Europe.  We did that in close coordination with our European partners and allies.  We’re waiting for a response from Russia.  I spoke to Foreign Minister Lavrov yesterday.  He said a response is forthcoming in the next few days.  I hope it comes.  We’ll take a hard look at it and then we’ll see where we go from there.  But we remain committed to seeing if we can find a diplomatic resolution.  It’s the right thing to do.  It’s the responsible thing to do.  It would avert a war.  But again, it really is President Putin’s choice to make, and what we’re seeing on the border remains deeply, deeply concerning.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>It appears from some of the comments from American officials over the last several days that you’re concerned that President Zelenskyy of the Ukraine is not taking this threat seriously enough.  Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Oh no, I think President Zelenskyy’s taking it very seriously.  He’s trying to maintain calm.  He doesn’t want his people to panic.  That’s the right thing to do.  But I think the Ukrainians are taking it very seriously.  And of course, if there is renewed aggression by Russia, the consequences would be terrible, and first and foremost terrible for the Ukrainian people.  So he recognizes that.  We have been supporting Ukraine.  We’ve provided more defensive assistance to Ukraine last year than we did in any previous year. Just the other day we put out a $1 billion loan guarantee to help bolster their economy.  Other countries are doing the same.  We’re there to support Ukraine.  We’re there to help it defend itself if there’s Russian aggression.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>But the President ruled out American troops.  Can the Ukrainians handle the Russians on their own?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>The Ukrainians have real capacity aided by many countries, including the United States.  I think they’d make life very difficult for the Russians if they went in, but again, the – by far the more responsible course is to avoid conflict in the first place, which is why we’re continuing to do everything we can to see if there’s a diplomatic resolution, at the same time making it very clear to Russia that it will face massive consequences for renewed aggression, not only in terms of continued support for Ukraine’s defense, not only in terms of bolstering NATO itself – which is exactly what President Putin says he wants to prevent – but also in terms of very serious economic and financial sanctions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>But the president of Ukraine also said that perhaps this idea of joining NATO is something – he called it a dream, I think was the word that he used.  Maybe that’s the likely outcome of this, that it’s something for the far, far, far distant future.  Is that accurate?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, the main point is that that should be up to the people of Ukraine and its elected government.  If they want to seek to join NATO, again, NATO has an “Open Door” policy.  It’s in its founding documents.  That principle is sacrosanct.  And so it really is up to them, and of course, it’s up to the Alliance itself in terms of admitting new members if they meet the requirements.  I think President Biden and others have said that’s not happening tomorrow, but the principle that if Ukraine seeks admission to NATO, it needs to be considered and the Alliance will make that decision – that remains front and center, and it’s not a principle we’re going back on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Final quick question:  Is the threat today greater than it was yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>You know, from day to day, George, you can’t say it’s higher or lower.  It’s there.  It’s there; it’s real.  We haven’t seen a pullback.  We’d like to see one.  If we see one we would welcome it.  We’re prepared for diplomacy.  We’re prepared for aggression.  We’re prepared either way.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Mr. Secretary, thanks as always for your time and your information.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thanks, George.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  All reports in the American media that intelligence is public in – the exact date of the attack, which is convinced that Russia will attack Ukraine day by day.  Can we consider that as some specific actions as not giving Putin any room for a maneuver – for a maneuver?  Or is just – is it just a coincidence?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We’ve done everything we can to share whatever information we receive, get access to, share it with – of course, with our Ukrainian partners as well as with other allies and partners, just to make sure that everyone is on notice about what could happen.  We have not seen a definitive decision by President Putin, but we do know that he’s put in place the capacity to act on very, very short notice.  And so as we’ve said, if he chooses the path of renewed aggression against Ukraine, it could happen at any time and it’s important that people understand that even as we work overtime through diplomacy to try to prevent Russia from renewing its aggression.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  It just feels like with this revealing the information, you’re always leaving Putin behind because when you’re saying that the actions will be on the 15th of February, it feels like it’s not going to be like that because everybody knows that already.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, it’s important to, I think, again, put Russia on notice that we see what it’s planning and we see what it might do, and to share that information with our partners and to share it, as necessary, with the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  So today Russian Duma ask Putin to recognize Ukrainian occupied region or bloc as independent.  So Putin should – could decide, but he didn’t say anything directly, particularly.  Can he use this decision – his decision as a blackmail, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, this effort is totally inconsistent with the Minsk Agreements.  It’s in contradiction of the Minsk Agreements.  And so if Russia is serious about implementing Minsk, it has to reject this effort, and it’s certainly something that we don’t recognize and don’t accept.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Is there any cautious optimism that Russia said again it’s ready for dialogue?  Today I’ve heard that thought in – from Stoltenberg.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  It’s not a question, for me at least, of being optimistic or pessimistic.  It’s a question of focusing on the facts, on what we see, and on what Russia is doing.  Yes, it said some more positive things about diplomacy in recent days, but I think your foreign minister, Foreign Minister Kuleba, had it exactly right when he said we should be less focused on what Russia says and more focused on what it does.  We have yet to see any removal of forces surrounding Ukraine, any pullback, any end to the so-called exercises that Russia has claimed it’s engaged in.  That’s what we’re focused on.  And if we see that, that would be positive, and I think that would create a better environment, a better atmosphere for pursuing diplomacy.</p>
<p>But we’re prepared either way.  If Russia chooses the path of diplomacy, we’re fully prepared to engage.  At the same time, if they choose the path of aggression, we’re prepared to respond to that too.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Am I correct the United States intelligence don’t see any withdrawal from Ukrainian border?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  That’s correct.  We have yet to see any pullback, any withdrawal of Russian forces from around Ukraine’s borders.  We’re watching that very carefully, and again, it’s very important to look at what Russia actually does, not what it says it’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And the last question that I couldn’t ask you that – could not now ask you about the American embassy in Ukraine.  Don’t you think there is a chance that by abandoning the embassy it might send a signal that Russia can now start their attack?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We’ve been very clear that if Russia engages in renewed aggression against Ukraine, there will be massive consequences, and that’s come from not just us, but from virtually all of our partners in the – in Europe, NATO, the European Union, the G7, the world’s largest democratic economies.  So that’s been very clear.  I think President Putin knows that if he makes the terrible mistake of renewing aggression, that’s what he’ll face.  And at the same time, we are – we continue to work to support Ukraine’s defenses.  We’ve provided over the last year well more than $600 million in 2021, more than at any previous year.  But we also want to make sure that we’re supporting your economy.  Just yesterday we announced a sovereign loan guarantee of a billion dollars in support of the economy.</p>
<p>When it comes to the embassy, look, I have a unique responsibility as Secretary of State, which is to look out for the safety and well-being of the people who work for me, and that’s really unique to me.  So we did make the decision to temporarily relocate our diplomatic functions from Kyiv to Lviv out of an abundance of precaution.  It’s the prudent thing to do because, again, my personal responsibility is to the safety and security of our people.  But they continue to work directly with their counterparts in the Ukrainian Government.  They continue to support the very – the different programs we have in support of Ukraine.  And of course, I’m on the phone almost every day with Dmytro Kuleba; others are on the phone with President Zelenskyy and other senior officials.</p>
<p>And so our support, our engagement, our work with the Ukrainian Government remains very, very strong.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Is there any expiry date for that removal – removing the embassy?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We’ll be focused on the facts.  We’ll be focused on what we see.  And again, unfortunately, we haven’t seen any pullback of Russian forces, but if it’s clear that Russia is truly engaged on a diplomatic path and the military threat goes away, of course, that changes the situation.  But that’s what we’re focused on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you very much for your time.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.  Good to be with you.  Nice to see you again.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Bye-bye.</p>

<p>In 2022, the United States proudly commemorates 100 years of uninterrupted diplomatic relations with Lithuania, a milestone that underscores our enduring friendship and vibrant people-to-people ties.  As we expand our partnership during the next century of our relationship, we look forward to deepening our collaboration to strengthen the Transatlantic ties that benefit our peoples.</p>
<p>I join you in celebrating this anniversary and send best wishes for health and prosperity to all Lithuanians.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Thank you again, Mr. Secretary, for this interview, as you have just held a ministerial meeting to coordinate global efforts in the fight against COVID.  Why hold such a meeting at this time?  What are the concerns?  What commitments were made by the United States and other participants?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  Indeed, there were twenty countries represented today, including France, the EU, countries in Africa, like South Africa and Senegal, and countries around the world.  A leadership group is what is needed now to fill in the gaps.  We have established a very concrete action plan where we have jointly identified what is missing and together, we are determined to act, to use the unique skills of different countries and institutions to focus on addressing shortcomings.  For example, a huge international effort went into vaccine manufacturing.  Now we must distribute them better and make sure that they actually end up in the arms of those who need them.</p>
<p>This is due to supply chain problems as everything needed for vaccines and their distribution must be manufactured and on time.  There is also a problem of misinformation and disinformation.  We see people around the world who are susceptible to disinformation and so they do not take the vaccines that are available.  There is also the issue of supporting those working on the front lines and making sure they have what they need to be protected.  And finally, we must build a more efficient system for the future.</p>
<p>Of these areas, of our six lines of effort, we must work together because without this coordination, in the end, everyone will do their duty, but to truly be effective we must identify, together, the shortcomings and work together to try to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Speaking of challenges that remain in Africa, the vaccination rate hovers at 10 percent.  Scientists in South Africa recently produced a copy of the Moderna vaccine.  However, as long as patents remain, vaccination efforts in Africa are slowed down, and the end of the global pandemic is also slowed.  So, the United States had declared last year their support for waiving patent protections.  What can you do in the meantime, and is it possible to waive patent protections soon?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  This is an ongoing effort that we support.  However, we already see impressive results in Africa when there is a focused, coordinated effort.  In Uganda, for example, the vaccination rate in November was 11 or 12 percent.  There was a concerted effort with international partners, and after six weeks of effort, the rate is now 50 percent among adults.  This is what is possible when we identify what is needed in each case &#8212; each case is different.  Regarding patents, local production in addition to manufacturing in the United States or India is very important.  The issue of patents for the future is important, because, unfortunately, we know that there will be another pandemic.  We need to be better prepared and more effective.  For the moment, we are certain that we can put an end to COVID-19 when we work closely together to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  You visited the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal last November.  The Institut will manufacture COVID-19 vaccines with U.S. support thanks to a $3 million investment.  Can you give us an update on that project?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  I was very impressed by this visit to Senegal and the Institut Pasteur.  It showed not only the need, but also the production capacity that exists at the national and regional level around the world.  This will make it much more effective in the future to not be dependent on global supply chains and be able to shorten supply chains to be able to immediately respond during a crisis.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  The other big topic today is Ukraine.  According to several officials quoted by American media, the United States expects an invasion of Ukraine by Russia on Wednesday.  So, are you expecting an invasion this Wednesday?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  Alas, it is quite possible because President Putin has put in place everything necessary to carry out an act of aggression against Ukraine.  We see more and more Russian forces surrounding Ukraine: over 100,000 troops.  This is extremely worrying, including what is happening with the deployment in Belarus to the north of Ukraine.  It would be very easy for President Putin to indicate that he is ready to take the path of diplomacy.  That would start with de-escalating, by reducing the troops that are surrounding Ukraine, without provocation.  There is no reason for Russia to act like this. The only explanation we see is another act of aggression.  We also need to see this in the context of history.  This happened before, in 2014, with the annexation of Crimea and the intervention in Eastern Ukraine.  Knowing that history, we are very concerned when we see what is happening at Ukraine’s borders.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Apologies because we did not get a response to my question.  Are you saying, yes, it is possible?  I was asking about an attack on Wednesday &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  Yes, an act of aggression starting this week is completely possible when we look at what is happening with the deployment of Russian forces in the areas surrounding Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Would President Biden make a visit to Ukraine, as the president of Ukraine is requesting?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  President Biden is quite engaged in diplomacy right now.  He spoke today with President Zelenskyy.  He spoke previously with President Putin.  We will not speculate as we continue to pursue diplomacy.  However, it depends entirely on Russia.  Will they go ahead and withdraw forces from the areas surrounding Ukraine to allow for diplomacy to try to solve existing issues?  Or, on the contrary, will they continue not just to maintain but increase the forces already deployed around Ukraine and act with aggression as early as this week?</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  And Washington has publicly exposed Russia&#8217;s intentions and even their plans.  The United States is running a fairly aggressive communications campaign.  Is this a strategy to disrupt Moscow&#8217;s calculations?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  Yes, because people need to understand the tools that the Russians have used in the past and are still using today, including carrying out false flag operations to justify an intervention that they had planned in advance.  This is absolutely something they would do, and shedding light on it is perhaps a way to avoid it.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Now we’re going to switch to English if we can have an answer on the question on COVID.</p>
<p>(In English)  What is the U.S. doing to support African countries, in the meantime, while you are waiting for the COVID?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We just completed a meeting on COVID with 20 leading countries and institutions including France, including Senegal, South Africa.  All coming together to try to advance what we’re calling a global action plan.  We’ve identified the gaps that exist in making sure that we can get to the end of COVID-19.  And, together, having identified the gaps, we’re determined to try to fill them.  So, it’s getting shots in arms.  We’ve been doing a good job on producing vaccines, now we have to get them into arms.</p>
<p>It’s making sure the supply chains that are necessary for all the different inputs are strong and resilient, and building those out.  It’s dealing with the problem of disinformation and misinformation so people feel confident in taking the vaccines.  It’s supporting the healthcare workers who are on the frontlines, making sure they have the protection they need to do their jobs.  It’s building back a stronger global health system.  All of these things together are –we know now what needs to be done.  The only way to do it effectively though is to do it in a coordinated way.  And that’s exactly what these 20 countries and institutions are doing.  When it comes to, for example, making sure as well, in the future, that vaccines can be produced locally, that we have manufacturing and the licensing that’s necessary to do that.  That’s something we’re also working on and determined to see happen.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>And so according to many reports the U.S. believes that Russia could invade Ukraine on Wednesday.  Is that still your assessment?  And what is the U.S. goal with making all this in the public?  Is it to call Putin’s bluff?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We’re deeply concerned that Russia could take action against Ukraine as early as this week.  Everything we’re seeing in terms of the deployment of Russian forces around Ukraine, on every side of Ukraine, leads us to that conclusion.  Russia, instead of de-escalating, has been escalating, putting more and more forces in.  And so we are deeply concerned about that.  The path to diplomacy remains open.  We are doing everything we possibly can to convince Russia that it should take the diplomatic path, the path of dialogue, to resolve whatever differences exist peacefully, but, if it pursues aggression, we’re fully prepared for that, in close coordination with all of our European allies and partners.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Via translation)  And hasn’t this crisis strengthened the ties between the United States and its European allies?  Because there was still a lack of trust in the United States at the beginning of the Biden administration due to the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the submarine crisis.  So, do you feel that you have regained the trust of your European allies?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>I think this crisis has absolutely reinforced transatlantic solidarity.  We see that every single day.  And that’s a product of two things.  It’s a product of the threat, unfortunately, posed by Russian aggression.  But it’s also the product of the intense consultations and coordination that we’ve had throughout, going back several months.  We looked and added up and we’ve had just, in the last few weeks, more than 200 engagements—meetings, video conferences, telephone calls across the Atlantic with European partners, with the EU, with NATO, with the OSCE, with individual countries.  And all of this, I think, is pushing us closer together.  It’s a reminder of the values that we share, the interests that we need to defend together.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Perfect, thank you very much, it was excellent. Your French is still as good as ever.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)<b>  </b>Oh, that&#8217;s nice.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Via translation)  And thank you for the time.  We know it&#8217;s a very busy week.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>(Via translation)  Glad to see you again, thank you.</p>

<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Would President Biden make a visit to Ukraine, as the president of Ukraine is requesting?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  President Biden is quite engaged in diplomacy right now.  He spoke today with President Zelenskyy.  He spoke previously with President Putin.  We will not speculate as we continue to pursue diplomacy.  However, it depends entirely on Russia.  Will they go ahead and withdraw forces from the areas surrounding Ukraine to allow for diplomacy to try to solve existing issues?  Or, on the contrary, will they continue not just to maintain but increase the forces already deployed around Ukraine and act with aggression as early as this week?</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  And Washington has publicly exposed Russia&#8217;s intentions and even their plans.  The United States is running a fairly aggressive communications campaign.  Is this a strategy to disrupt Moscow&#8217;s calculations?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)  Yes, because people need to understand the tools that the Russians have used in the past and are still using today, including carrying out false flag operations to justify an intervention that they had planned in advance.  This is absolutely something they would do, and shedding light on it is perhaps a way to avoid it.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Now we’re going to switch to English if we can have an answer on the question on COVID.</p>
<p>(In English)  What is the U.S. doing to support African countries, in the meantime, while you are waiting for the COVID?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We just completed a meeting on COVID with 20 leading countries and institutions including France, including Senegal, South Africa.  All coming together to try to advance what we’re calling a global action plan.  We’ve identified the gaps that exist in making sure that we can get to the end of COVID-19.  And, together, having identified the gaps, we’re determined to try to fill them.  So, it’s getting shots in arms.  We’ve been doing a good job on producing vaccines, now we have to get them into arms.</p>
<p>It’s making sure the supply chains that are necessary for all the different inputs are strong and resilient, and building those out.  It’s dealing with the problem of disinformation and misinformation so people feel confident in taking the vaccines.  It’s supporting the healthcare workers who are on the frontlines, making sure they have the protection they need to do their jobs.  It’s building back a stronger global health system.  All of these things together are –we know now what needs to be done.  The only way to do it effectively though is to do it in a coordinated way.  And that’s exactly what these 20 countries and institutions are doing.  When it comes to, for example, making sure as well, in the future, that vaccines can be produced locally, that we have manufacturing and the licensing that’s necessary to do that.  That’s something we’re also working on and determined to see happen.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>And so according to many reports the U.S. believes that Russia could invade Ukraine on Wednesday.  Is that still your assessment?  And what is the U.S. goal with making all this in the public?  Is it to call Putin’s bluff?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We’re deeply concerned that Russia could take action against Ukraine as early as this week.  Everything we’re seeing in terms of the deployment of Russian forces around Ukraine, on every side of Ukraine, leads us to that conclusion.  Russia, instead of de-escalating, has been escalating, putting more and more forces in.  And so we are deeply concerned about that.  The path to diplomacy remains open.  We are doing everything we possibly can to convince Russia that it should take the diplomatic path, the path of dialogue, to resolve whatever differences exist peacefully, but, if it pursues aggression, we’re fully prepared for that, in close coordination with all of our European allies and partners.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Via translation)  And hasn’t this crisis strengthened the ties between the United States and its European allies?  Because there was still a lack of trust in the United States at the beginning of the Biden administration due to the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the submarine crisis.  So, do you feel that you have regained the trust of your European allies?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>I think this crisis has absolutely reinforced transatlantic solidarity.  We see that every single day.  And that’s a product of two things.  It’s a product of the threat, unfortunately, posed by Russian aggression.  But it’s also the product of the intense consultations and coordination that we’ve had throughout, going back several months.  We looked and added up and we’ve had just, in the last few weeks, more than 200 engagements—meetings, video conferences, telephone calls across the Atlantic with European partners, with the EU, with NATO, with the OSCE, with individual countries.  And all of this, I think, is pushing us closer together.  It’s a reminder of the values that we share, the interests that we need to defend together.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>(Via translation)  Perfect, thank you very much, it was excellent. Your French is still as good as ever.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>(Via translation)<b>  </b>Oh, that&#8217;s nice.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Via translation)  And thank you for the time.  We know it&#8217;s a very busy week.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>(Via translation)  Glad to see you again, thank you.</p>
