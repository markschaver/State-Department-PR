					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today, virtual United States-Turkmenistan Annual Bilateral Consultations (ABCs) concluded after two days of productive discussions.  A senior U.S. delegation, led by Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu, hosted Foreign Minister Rashid Meredov and the senior Turkmen delegation.</p>
<p>The ABCs began in 2009 so that our governments could discuss important policy issues. They continue to serve that important role, even as the global and regional situation have evolved.</p>
<p>During the consultations, the U.S. delegation reinforced support for the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Turkmenistan and reiterated our shared commitment to peace, prosperity, and security in Central Asia through the C5+1 diplomatic platform.  The U.S. delegation reiterated the importance of condemning Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine and of maintaining solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  The delegations discussed a wide range of bilateral and regional issues including cooperation on strengthening border security, counternarcotics, and counterterrorism, as well as the need for progress on human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, labor issues, and education opportunities.  Both delegations also discussed their growing engagement on climate action, trade and business, women’s economic empowerment, and regional connectivity of energy resources.</p>
<p>The United States looks forward to strengthening our efforts with Turkmenistan in all of these important areas and deepening the friendship between our peoples.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States and the Republic of Korea (ROK) are standing shoulder-to-shoulder in support of Ukraine by responding to Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack.  The ROK’s announcement of economic actions against Russia will help defend the freedom, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of Ukraine and illustrates the ROK’s commitment to preserving the rules-based international order. The ROK’s support for denying selected Russian banks access to the global SWIFT financial messaging system, along with its commitment to block financial transactions with major Russian banks and impose other financial and export controls, will support international efforts to isolate Russia from the international financial system and technology trade.   At the same time, the ROK’s commitment to release additional petroleum from its strategic reserves will help our shared efforts to stabilize the global energy market.  The United States also welcomes the ROK’s commitment to help the people of Ukraine by committing an additional $10 million in emergency humanitarian aid.  Our joint actions demonstrate the unity and resolve of the United States, the ROK, and our allies and partners to stop Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>On February 26, 2022, Ukraine filed an application at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to initiate proceedings against the Russian Federation under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Ukraine seeks to address Russia’s groundless claims that genocide has occurred in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts of Ukraine and establish that Russia has no lawful basis to take military action on the basis of those false claims. Ukraine has also requested the ICJ exercise its authority to indicate provisional measures to preserve Ukraine’s rights and limit the ongoing and irreparable harm to the Ukrainian people as well as Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.</p>
<p>As the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, the ICJ has a vital role to play in the peaceful settlement of disputes. Ukraine also requested the Court call upon Russia to halt immediately all military actions in Ukraine pending the Court’s review. Today, in response to that request, the Court called on the Russian Federation to act in a manner that would allow any provisional measures ordered by the Court to have an actual impact. This is another clear indication that Russia must cease its military activities in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Considering the gravity of the crisis in Ukraine that has resulted from Russia’s unprovoked invasion, we trust the Court is taking into consideration the dire circumstances and rapidly unfolding events and hope that it will act with utmost urgency on Ukraine’s request for provisional measures.</p>
<p>Each day that Russia is unconstrained in its aggression is a day that brings more violence, suffering, death, and destruction in Ukraine. The United States stands with the people of Ukraine.</p>

		<title>2022 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report Release</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State submitted the 2022 edition of the annual International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) to Congress today. This two-volume, Congressionally-mandated report assesses foreign governments’ efforts to reduce illicit drug production, trafficking, and use as well as their work to counter drug trafficking-related money laundering. The INCSR was first published in 1986, and this edition covers calendar year 2021.</p>
<p>This year’s INCSR stresses that the opioid crisis remains a global challenge that requires urgent international action. Synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, continue to claim far too many lives in the United States and represent a growing global threat. The report highlights not only increases in trafficking and abuse of fentanyl and other deadly synthetic opioids across the globe but also concerning levels of overseas production of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. Reducing the global drug threat will require sustained political commitments from partner governments, supported by U.S. assistance, to target all the links in the supplier-to-consumer chain. This means curbing the production of illicit drugs, interdicting drug shipments, tackling illicit finance, and reducing drug demand everywhere.</p>
<p>Volume I of the INCSR, addressing Drugs and Chemical Control, provides an overview of 2021 drug control efforts undertaken by 63 countries. Volume II, Money Laundering, highlights the nature of drug trafficking-related money laundering – and specific vulnerabilities – in 80 countries and jurisdictions as well as these governments’ efforts to strengthen their anti-money laundering regimes.</p>
<p>The full text of INCSR Volumes I and II can be viewed at <a href="https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-international-narcotics-and-law-enforcement-affairs-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-international-narcotics-and-law-enforcement-affairs-releases/</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State is restarting the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) Direct Access Program for U.S.-Affiliated Iraqis (Iraqi P-2 Program). The United States is committed to ensuring those who sacrificed their own safety for our collective interests have an opportunity to seek refuge in the United States. This includes Iraqis who have served alongside U.S. service members.</p>
<p>After an extensive review, we have resumed case processing for a select number of Iraqi P-2 cases that had been previously suspended during our review of the program. In coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, we will continue to review and process all other existing Iraqi P-2 cases that can move forward as well as accept new applications to the program.</p>
<p>During our review of the Iraqi P-2 Program, we identified and resolved the issues that led to our suspension of the program in January of 2021. We are committed to ensuring that only bona fide and qualified Iraqis who supported U.S. efforts in Iraq are considered for this important humanitarian program.</p>
<p>All refugees undergo the highest level of security screening and vetting, including extensive interviews and the vetting of biographic and biometric information. Only after an applicant has cleared all security vetting can they be deemed eligible for admission to the United States. In the admission of refugees to the United States, the safety and security of the American people is our highest priority.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of State is restarting the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) Direct Access Program for U.S.-Affiliated Iraqis (Iraqi P-2 Program). The United States is committed to ensuring those who sacrificed their own safety for our collective interests have an opportunity to seek refuge in the United States. This includes Iraqis who have served alongside U.S. service members.</p>
<p>After an extensive review, we have resumed case processing for a select number of Iraqi P-2 cases that had been previously suspended during our review of the program. In coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, we will continue to review and process all other existing Iraqi P-2 cases that can move forward as well as accept new applications to the program.</p>
<p>During our review of the Iraqi P-2 Program, we identified and resolved the issues that led to our suspension of the program in January of 2021. We are committed to ensuring that only bona fide and qualified Iraqis who supported U.S. efforts in Iraq are considered for this important humanitarian program.</p>
<p>All refugees undergo the highest level of security screening and vetting, including extensive interviews and the vetting of biographic and biometric information. Only after an applicant has cleared all security vetting can they be deemed eligible for admission to the United States. In the admission of refugees to the United States, the safety and security of the American people is our highest priority.</p>
