<p>Under Secretary John Bass; Ambassador Beth Jones, Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts; and other senior officials met yesterday with representatives of a self-organized coalition of more than 180 organizations, including veterans, frontline civilians, social workers, attorneys, non-profits, Congressional staff, and private sector employees, working to support relocation and resettlement of our Afghan allies and partners.</p>
<p>The meeting was part of the State Department’s ongoing collaboration with the coalition and recognition of the extraordinary commitment that U.S. citizens have made to supporting our Afghan friends and allies.</p>
<p>Under Secretary Bass, Ambassador Jones, and senior officials thanked the representatives of the coalition for their leadership and partnership and listened to stories of Afghans beginning their new lives in the United States.  The coalition representatives are exemplary of the extraordinary contributions of individuals and communities across the country that are helping make good on our country’s commitment to our Afghan allies, including by welcoming tens of thousands into our communities, as the American people have done many times before with generosity and grace throughout our history.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States reiterates its strong support for the combined efforts of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS), the African Union (AU), and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) to facilitate a political process to restore a civilian-led transition to democracy in Sudan.  We welcome the outreach and progress made to date.</p>
<p>As the process moves forward and the facilitators begin conversations with stakeholders on the substance of a solution, we are convinced that the UNITAMS-AU-IGAD facilitated process is the most inclusive mechanism to achieve an urgently needed agreement on a civilian-led transitional framework.  We continue to encourage all Sudanese civilian and military actors to utilize this process to achieve democratic progress and national stability.</p>
<p>In recent phone calls with Sudanese civilian and military leaders, Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Molly Phee welcomed the release of political detainees in the past few weeks.  At the same time, she pressed for the full implementation of promised confidence-building measures by the Sudanese military including lifting the state of emergency and the release of the remaining political detainees.  She stressed the need for all stakeholders to participate constructively in the UNITAMS-AU-IGAD facilitated process and to make rapid progress on the framework for a civilian transitional government.  She underscored the need for the military to transfer power to a civilian government established under such a framework to enable the resumption of international financial support and development assistance.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Coinciding with the 16th meeting of the Counter ISIS Finance Group (CIFG) of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the United States is designating today five individuals participating in an ISIS network of financial facilitators operating across Indonesia, Syria, and Turkey.  The United States, Italy, and Saudi Arabia co-lead the CIFG, which comprises nearly 70 countries and international organizations and coordinates efforts against ISIS financial support networks worldwide.  The United States is committed to working with the Global Coalition to deny ISIS the ability to raise and move funds across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The individuals designated today, pursuant to Executive Order 13224, as amended, have facilitated the travel of violent extremists to Syria and other areas where ISIS operates.  By designating them, we aim to expose and disrupt an international ISIS facilitation network that has financed ISIS recruitment, including of vulnerable children in Syria.</p>
