					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Edgars Rinkēvičs, Latvian Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Riga, Latvia</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER RINKĒVIČS:</b>  (Via Interpreter)  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  And indeed, today I had the honor to welcome my U.S. counterpart here in the National Museum of Latvia, Mr. Blinken.  When we met last time in December, when the foreign ministers of NATO countries met here in Riga, we couldn’t have imagined we would meet so soon again.  It is always, of course, a big pleasure to meet with our American friends, but we are currently meeting in very grave circumstances, and we discussed a broad range of issues – of course, primarily our support and assistance to Ukraine.</p>
<p>I reassured my American colleague of Latvia’s commitment to continue providing all kinds of support and help in close cooperation with our allies and the United States of America.  We also talked about more efficient ways of countering Russian aggression.  We also discussed potential timing of sanctions.  But sanctions are not – not only have to be imposed, but they also have to be efficient.  We agreed on exchange of information to identify all oligarch properties, all accounts, all properties, all assets, all kinds of real estate, and movable property.  And transatlantic bonded cooperation is absolutely essential in this regard, and we will continue working with our colleagues in the EU as well as in the United States on further sanctions.</p>
<p>We also talked about further reinforcement of the eastern flank of NATO, reinforcement or strengthening of the regional security of Baltic countries.  I would like to thank the United States, Canada, Spain, other Allies, who are already contributing to our security and have contributed additionally to our security more recently.</p>
<p>Of course, looking at the most recent developments, we are very happy about the permanent presence of U.S. forces here in Latvia.  We have no illusions about Putin’s Russia anymore.  I don’t really see any reason, any good reason, to assume that Russia might change its policy.</p>
<p>Before I hand it over to my colleague, I would like to also underline that we – NATO also supports journalists and media, media in Russia and Belarus, who represent free, independent media, not only by helping them leave their country and also facilitating their work here or outside Belarus and Russia.  It is important to make sure that Russian residents, Russians living in other countries, have access to impartial information, unbiased information, and not from Russian propaganda channels.  And we also agreed to cooperate on that as well.</p>
<p>That is as far as my introduction goes.  Now I’d like to hand it over to Antony Blinken.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Edgars, thank you very, very much.  And to be – it’s always good to be back, but I wish it was under different circumstances.  We remember well the extraordinary job you did, Latvia did, in hosting us and hosting our NATO colleagues.  And that spirit very much is (inaudible) all the work we’ve been doing together in recent weeks, particularly the work that’s been made necessary by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p>I should note that we’re here now in what is the 100th anniversary year of diplomatic relations between the United States and Latvia.  When we were here (inaudible) NATO (inaudible), I reflected at the time on how strong the partnership between our countries has grown, especially in the last 30 years, since Latvia’s independence, rooted in a shared commitment to democracy, to human rights, to the rule of law.  And I said that while those principles could feel a little bit abstract at times, we were seeing serious challenges to them by autocratic governments that were seeking to erode the international rules-based order that is so essential to peace and security.  Well, that abstraction has become, unfortunately, three months later a very powerful reality.  And any question of how vital it is that we protect those values I think has been put to rest.</p>
<p>Since Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine began, hundreds of civilians have been killed, hundreds more wounded.  As it is today, more than 1.5 million people, mostly women and children, have had to flee Ukraine, flee their homes.  Many more people are trying to flee, but they cannot get out of besieged areas.  In the last several days, more strikes have killed and wounded civilians as they try to leave the cities that are being surrounded by Russian forces.  Women and children, the elderly, wounded civilians, people with disabilities, are trying to escape cities where there’s no heat, no electricity, relentless bombardment, and where they’re running out of food and medicine.  And there continue to be reports of attacks by Russian forces on agreed-upon humanitarian corridors.</p>
<p>We’ve seen scenes like this before in Europe.  Every Russian has lived or learned about the horrific siege of Leningrad during World War II, in which that city’s civilian population was systematically starved and intentionally destroyed over nearly 900 days, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths.  That siege affected millions of Russian families, including President Putin’s, whose one-year-old brother was one of the many victims.  Now, Russia is starving out cities like Mariupol.  It’s shameful.  The world is saying to Russia:  Stop these attacks immediately.  Let the food and medicine in.  Let the people out safely, and end this war of choice against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Latvians who lived through decades of Soviet occupation understand deeply how wrong this is, and how the world must defend Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign, democratic country, free to choose its own future.  Latvia has done just that.  It quickly provided security assistance to Ukraine, including Stinger missiles, anti-tank weapons, small arms, ammunition, protective gear, medical supplies.  And the Latvian people have stepped forward as well with an outpouring of humanitarian donations, a pledge to welcome more than 10,000 refugees from Ukraine into their homes and into their communities.</p>
<p>Latvia and the United States, together with our allies and partners, will continue to stand with Ukraine.  We’re surging our security assistance to strengthen Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself.  We’re increasing humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people, both those still inside Ukraine and those who have had to flee.  We’re raising costs on the Kremlin, and all who aid and enable it, for continuing this war.</p>
<p>We’re also bolstering our shared defense.  We and our NATO Allies are prepared to meet any threat.  President Biden spoke to the American people just a few days ago in his State of the Union address, and he made clear again something he’s affirmed repeatedly:  We will defend every inch of NATO territory against aggression coming from anywhere at any time.  Our commitment to Article 5 – an attack on one is an attack on all – is ironclad.  The President has called it sacrosanct.  And no one – no one – should have any doubt about that.</p>
<p>NATO activated our defense plans for the eastern flank for the first time in history, giving the Supreme Allied Commander Europe authority to deploy the NATO response force as needed.  Many Allies have increased their troop presence and contributed additional equipment and capabilities to this effort.  President Biden ordered the deployment of an additional 7,000 U.S. troops to Europe, and moved forces already in Europe to NATO’s eastern flank, including to Latvia.</p>
<p>We now have more than a thousand U.S. soldiers here in Latvia.  We’ll continue to rotate our forces to Latvia and the Baltic region to train alongside the NATO-enhanced forward presence battle group led by Canada in partnership with Latvia’s armed forces.  And we deployed F-35 strike fighter jets to the region to augment NATO’s enhanced air policing mission.</p>
<p>We’re also working with Latvia and multi-partners on security in other realms: cybersecurity to protect critical infrastructure against malicious actors, and energy security so that Latvia’s energy supply is not dependent upon Russia.</p>
<p>Latvia hosts the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, a critical resource in this time of information warfare, something Edgars and I talked about, and we’re working together to support independent media to push back against disinformation, including by helping young people to be able to identify it.  Our collaboration in these areas is, quite simply, more important than ever, and I look forward to continuing that.</p>
<p>This is my second stop in a visit to all three Baltic countries.  Over the past 30 years, the Baltics have formed a democratic wall that is now standing against the tide of autocracy that Moscow is seeking to push further into Europe.  And my message on behalf of the United States to the people of Latvia, to all of the Baltics, is that the United States is more committed than ever to standing with you as our democracies rise to the challenge of this moment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very moving to see the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag in this city, in Lithuania where I just came from, on public monuments, homes, schools, businesses.  The incredibly brave and resilient Ukrainian people will fight for as long as it takes for their country.  I know and they know that they can count on the support of Latvia, the United States, and many countries in Europe and around the world.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  You will be needing your interpreting &#8212;</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) Now we move to questions and answers and Latvian Television, Ina Strazdina.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  (Via interpreter) Thank you for this opportunity.  Ina Strazdina, Latvian Television.  I would like to ask Mr. Rinkēvičs, first of all:  You already mentioned this – the possibility of having troops in Latvia, standing.  Have you discussed it with Mr. Blinken, the possibility to increase the troops here in Latvia, and have permanently deployed American soldiers here in Latvia?  And what was the answer given to you?</p>
<p>And the question to Mr. Blinken, closing the skies.  This is what Ukraine is demanding very intensively.  NATO has provided its explanation that it would complicate the situation even more, turning this into large-scale war.  But you have also said that the countries have been given green light to give planes to the states.  And Poland was mentioned, that you had offered substitute fleet to Poland if it offered its planes to Ukraine, but the answer is not clear.  What would be the practical solution to this, practical assistance to Ukraine in defending its sky?</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER RINKĒVIČS:</b>  (Via interpreter) I have to say, thank you for the question.  Indeed, we discussed the matter of how to reinforce the presence of NATO forces and also of the United States as part of NATO here in the region.  And I underscored that I would like to have permanent solutions to this thing.  This situation is developing.</p>
<p>And of course, my colleague – because it wouldn’t be right to re-tell the opinion of the United States’ Secretary of State, he will state his (inaudible) himself (inaudible) the ministry of foreign affairs and defense are preparing for NATO summit in Madrid, preparing the new strategic concept, responding to the changing in the situation.  We are going to work on what Antony said to have effective protection of all NATO states, what with the measures that would be needed, and the presence should be as long as it is necessary while, of course, as constant Putin’s regime is, as constant this presence is going to be, and even beyond it, perhaps.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you, and I very much agree with what Edgars has said.  Just a couple of things in response to questions.</p>
<p>First, as I noted, we have and NATO has already significantly reinforced the eastern flank, including right here in Latvia with the addition of forces, with the addition of equipment, with the addition of the F-35 strike fighter planes.  We’re doing this in close partnership with NATO Allies.  Canada, of course, is playing a lead role here in Latvia.</p>
<p>We also are on a regular basis reviewing our global posture, and that will continue.  And of course, as we do that, we have to factor in the latest developments, including this aggression from Russia.  So all of that will factor into our thinking, into our decisions about what we do going forward.  And of course, we’re working all of these issues within the NATO Alliance.  That’s vital as well.</p>
<p>Second, it’s very important to note everything that has been done, and continues to be done, to help the Ukrainians defend themselves.  Over the last year, the United States has provided more than a billion dollars in security assistance to Ukraine.  Just within the last couple of weeks, President Biden created the authority to provide an additional $350 million in defense support to Ukraine.  And within a week, most of that – about 70 percent – is already in the hands of Ukrainians, being used very effectively against Russian aggression.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the President made a request of our Congress for emergency aid of $10 billion.  And that $10 billion, which I believe Congress will provide very quickly, will go to additional security assistance for Ukraine.  It will go to humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, both inside Ukraine and outside.  And it will go to further efforts to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank.</p>
<p>So all of that is ongoing.  And as Edgars said, what we are focused on is what can we do to continue to help the Ukrainians be as effective as possible in what they’re doing, which is defending their country against this Russian aggression.  That’s what we’re focused on and our military experts are focused on.</p>
<p>I’ve talked about and the secretary general of NATO has talked about the question of the no-fly zone before.  And just to be clear and to repeat where we are: our efforts are all in the direction of ending this war as quickly as possible, ending the suffering as quickly as possible.  And what we don’t want to do is to widen it, and to widen it to our own countries, to our own territory.  The no-fly zone, to be very clear about what that involves, is – that means that if a Russian plane violate the zone as declared, we shoot them down.  And that runs the considerable risk of creating a direct conflict between our countries and Russia, and thus a wider war, which is in no one’s interest, including in the interest of the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>But – and I want to repeat this very clearly – when it comes to any aggression of any kind against NATO territory by Russia or anyone else for that matter, we are absolutely committed to the defense of that territory – every square inch.  President Biden has made that repeatedly clear that as well.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  <i>Wall Street Journal, </i>William Mauldin.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Thank you very much for doing this.  For Minister Rinkēvičs, you mentioned effective protection is needed for Latvia and the Baltic countries.  What constitutes effective protection?  Did you ask for any to – any new types of military hardware or other support?  And did that include anti-aircraft systems?  And did the U.S. seem willing to provide it?</p>
<p>I also wanted to ask Secretary Blinken:  You have upcoming meetings with Foreign Minister Lapid of Israel, with President Macron of France.  What role does Israel play, especially in any possible mediation or engagement with Russia, during this conflict?  And do you have any message to send to Russia other than the general need to de-escalate or stop fighting in Ukraine?</p>
<p>And then just to clarify one thing you said earlier in Vilnius, you mentioned more permanent basing of troops here.  Does that mean there is a decision or there isn’t a decision to base troops permanently here in the Baltics countries, specifically?  And – because there was a little bit of ambiguity with that, and so I’m just very curious.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER RINKĒVIČS:  </b>Thank you very much.  I’ll answer in English.  Well, yes, indeed, we discussed the further steps when it comes to providing additional protection.  And we see the need and we are also learning from what is happening in Ukraine.  We are seeing what Russians are doing and we understand that we need to bolster our air defense.  That’s absolutely clear.  We also feel that we need to bolster our coastal defense, cyber defense.  And we are discussing and talking not only with the Secretary of State, but also with the Secretary of Defense.  We see the willingness to work with us, and to look into the needs.  And of course, that requires some process, but I’m pretty confident that there is understanding about the need to work together and to address some of those issues.</p>
<p>But let me also mention another thing that is equally important than defense, and that’s energy.  I think that what we all understand that we need to work, and it is not only Latvia or Lithuania or Estonia – that’s entire European Union, Europe as a whole.  We need to work to reduce dependency on Russian gas and oil.  We discussed at some length and detail also what could be done.  And I say that here, the United States can play a critical role, and we are willing to continue.  And this region is connecting from Russia, the Russian electricity grid, and connecting to European electricity grid.  Some work is being done.  And also that means, of course, reducing dependency of gas.  But here we need a bit wider effort through LNG, through renewable energy issues.</p>
<p>So I would put now military defense and energy defense on an equal footing, and also the cyber defense, so three areas.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Did you ask for anti-aircraft assistance from NATO?</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER RINKĒVIČS:  </b>We do work on those issues, yes, we do work.  But I think that we will not go into details before there are more substantial efforts.  And we are working through NATO and with our partners on some additional needs that we see we need.  And I’m very glad that both NATO and our partners are addressing those challenges seriously.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Will, first, on the last part of your question, just to be clear – and I’m sorry if I wasn’t before, earlier today – as I said and as I just mentioned again now, we’re on a regular basis reviewing the global posture of our forces, to include of course here in Europe.  And we have to factor in any developments, any changes in the threat – and we will do that.  And when it comes to questions such as permanent basing, these questions come up and we’ll certainly look to answer them in the context of doing the review of our of our posture.  But just to be very clear, no, there’s no decision of that kind.  I was just saying that this is a question that’s come up, and we’ll, in the context of doing reviews of our posture in Europe and elsewhere, be looking at that.</p>
<p>Second, with regard to the meetings, I’ll – I’m not going to get ahead of them.  I’ll let them more or less speak for themselves, once I’ve had the chance to actually compare notes with my friend Yair Lapid later this evening here, and then with President Macron tomorrow in France.  But I think there is – there’s certainly no change in our message to Moscow, our message to Russia, to President Putin:  End the war.  End it now.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary of State, Your Excellency Minister, dear media representatives.  This concludes our press conference.</p>

<p>Latvians who lived through decades of Soviet occupation understand deeply how wrong this is, and how the world must defend Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign, democratic country, free to choose its own future.  Latvia has done just that.  It quickly provided security assistance to Ukraine, including Stinger missiles, anti-tank weapons, small arms, ammunition, protective gear, medical supplies.  And the Latvian people have stepped forward as well with an outpouring of humanitarian donations, a pledge to welcome more than 10,000 refugees from Ukraine into their homes and into their communities.</p>
<p>Latvia and the United States, together with our allies and partners, will continue to stand with Ukraine.  We’re surging our security assistance to strengthen Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself.  We’re increasing humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people, both those still inside Ukraine and those who have had to flee.  We’re raising costs on the Kremlin, and all who aid and enable it, for continuing this war.</p>
<p>We’re also bolstering our shared defense.  We and our NATO Allies are prepared to meet any threat.  President Biden spoke to the American people just a few days ago in his State of the Union address, and he made clear again something he’s affirmed repeatedly:  We will defend every inch of NATO territory against aggression coming from anywhere at any time.  Our commitment to Article 5 – an attack on one is an attack on all – is ironclad.  The President has called it sacrosanct.  And no one – no one – should have any doubt about that.</p>
<p>NATO activated our defense plans for the eastern flank for the first time in history, giving the Supreme Allied Commander Europe authority to deploy the NATO response force as needed.  Many Allies have increased their troop presence and contributed additional equipment and capabilities to this effort.  President Biden ordered the deployment of an additional 7,000 U.S. troops to Europe, and moved forces already in Europe to NATO’s eastern flank, including to Latvia.</p>
<p>We now have more than a thousand U.S. soldiers here in Latvia.  We’ll continue to rotate our forces to Latvia and the Baltic region to train alongside the NATO-enhanced forward presence battle group led by Canada in partnership with Latvia’s armed forces.  And we deployed F-35 strike fighter jets to the region to augment NATO’s enhanced air policing mission.</p>
<p>We’re also working with Latvia and multi-partners on security in other realms: cybersecurity to protect critical infrastructure against malicious actors, and energy security so that Latvia’s energy supply is not dependent upon Russia.</p>
<p>Latvia hosts the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, a critical resource in this time of information warfare, something Edgars and I talked about, and we’re working together to support independent media to push back against disinformation, including by helping young people to be able to identify it.  Our collaboration in these areas is, quite simply, more important than ever, and I look forward to continuing that.</p>
<p>This is my second stop in a visit to all three Baltic countries.  Over the past 30 years, the Baltics have formed a democratic wall that is now standing against the tide of autocracy that Moscow is seeking to push further into Europe.  And my message on behalf of the United States to the people of Latvia, to all of the Baltics, is that the United States is more committed than ever to standing with you as our democracies rise to the challenge of this moment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very moving to see the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag in this city, in Lithuania where I just came from, on public monuments, homes, schools, businesses.  The incredibly brave and resilient Ukrainian people will fight for as long as it takes for their country.  I know and they know that they can count on the support of Latvia, the United States, and many countries in Europe and around the world.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  You will be needing your interpreting &#8212;</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) Now we move to questions and answers and Latvian Television, Ina Strazdina.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  (Via interpreter) Thank you for this opportunity.  Ina Strazdina, Latvian Television.  I would like to ask Mr. Rinkēvičs, first of all:  You already mentioned this – the possibility of having troops in Latvia, standing.  Have you discussed it with Mr. Blinken, the possibility to increase the troops here in Latvia, and have permanently deployed American soldiers here in Latvia?  And what was the answer given to you?</p>
<p>And the question to Mr. Blinken, closing the skies.  This is what Ukraine is demanding very intensively.  NATO has provided its explanation that it would complicate the situation even more, turning this into large-scale war.  But you have also said that the countries have been given green light to give planes to the states.  And Poland was mentioned, that you had offered substitute fleet to Poland if it offered its planes to Ukraine, but the answer is not clear.  What would be the practical solution to this, practical assistance to Ukraine in defending its sky?</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER RINKĒVIČS:</b>  (Via interpreter) I have to say, thank you for the question.  Indeed, we discussed the matter of how to reinforce the presence of NATO forces and also of the United States as part of NATO here in the region.  And I underscored that I would like to have permanent solutions to this thing.  This situation is developing.</p>
<p>And of course, my colleague – because it wouldn’t be right to re-tell the opinion of the United States’ Secretary of State, he will state his (inaudible) himself (inaudible) the ministry of foreign affairs and defense are preparing for NATO summit in Madrid, preparing the new strategic concept, responding to the changing in the situation.  We are going to work on what Antony said to have effective protection of all NATO states, what with the measures that would be needed, and the presence should be as long as it is necessary while, of course, as constant Putin’s regime is, as constant this presence is going to be, and even beyond it, perhaps.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you, and I very much agree with what Edgars has said.  Just a couple of things in response to questions.</p>
<p>First, as I noted, we have and NATO has already significantly reinforced the eastern flank, including right here in Latvia with the addition of forces, with the addition of equipment, with the addition of the F-35 strike fighter planes.  We’re doing this in close partnership with NATO Allies.  Canada, of course, is playing a lead role here in Latvia.</p>
<p>We also are on a regular basis reviewing our global posture, and that will continue.  And of course, as we do that, we have to factor in the latest developments, including this aggression from Russia.  So all of that will factor into our thinking, into our decisions about what we do going forward.  And of course, we’re working all of these issues within the NATO Alliance.  That’s vital as well.</p>
<p>Second, it’s very important to note everything that has been done, and continues to be done, to help the Ukrainians defend themselves.  Over the last year, the United States has provided more than a billion dollars in security assistance to Ukraine.  Just within the last couple of weeks, President Biden created the authority to provide an additional $350 million in defense support to Ukraine.  And within a week, most of that – about 70 percent – is already in the hands of Ukrainians, being used very effectively against Russian aggression.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the President made a request of our Congress for emergency aid of $10 billion.  And that $10 billion, which I believe Congress will provide very quickly, will go to additional security assistance for Ukraine.  It will go to humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, both inside Ukraine and outside.  And it will go to further efforts to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank.</p>
<p>So all of that is ongoing.  And as Edgars said, what we are focused on is what can we do to continue to help the Ukrainians be as effective as possible in what they’re doing, which is defending their country against this Russian aggression.  That’s what we’re focused on and our military experts are focused on.</p>
<p>I’ve talked about and the secretary general of NATO has talked about the question of the no-fly zone before.  And just to be clear and to repeat where we are: our efforts are all in the direction of ending this war as quickly as possible, ending the suffering as quickly as possible.  And what we don’t want to do is to widen it, and to widen it to our own countries, to our own territory.  The no-fly zone, to be very clear about what that involves, is – that means that if a Russian plane violate the zone as declared, we shoot them down.  And that runs the considerable risk of creating a direct conflict between our countries and Russia, and thus a wider war, which is in no one’s interest, including in the interest of the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>But – and I want to repeat this very clearly – when it comes to any aggression of any kind against NATO territory by Russia or anyone else for that matter, we are absolutely committed to the defense of that territory – every square inch.  President Biden has made that repeatedly clear that as well.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  <i>Wall Street Journal, </i>William Mauldin.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Thank you very much for doing this.  For Minister Rinkēvičs, you mentioned effective protection is needed for Latvia and the Baltic countries.  What constitutes effective protection?  Did you ask for any to – any new types of military hardware or other support?  And did that include anti-aircraft systems?  And did the U.S. seem willing to provide it?</p>
<p>I also wanted to ask Secretary Blinken:  You have upcoming meetings with Foreign Minister Lapid of Israel, with President Macron of France.  What role does Israel play, especially in any possible mediation or engagement with Russia, during this conflict?  And do you have any message to send to Russia other than the general need to de-escalate or stop fighting in Ukraine?</p>
<p>And then just to clarify one thing you said earlier in Vilnius, you mentioned more permanent basing of troops here.  Does that mean there is a decision or there isn’t a decision to base troops permanently here in the Baltics countries, specifically?  And – because there was a little bit of ambiguity with that, and so I’m just very curious.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER RINKĒVIČS:  </b>Thank you very much.  I’ll answer in English.  Well, yes, indeed, we discussed the further steps when it comes to providing additional protection.  And we see the need and we are also learning from what is happening in Ukraine.  We are seeing what Russians are doing and we understand that we need to bolster our air defense.  That’s absolutely clear.  We also feel that we need to bolster our coastal defense, cyber defense.  And we are discussing and talking not only with the Secretary of State, but also with the Secretary of Defense.  We see the willingness to work with us, and to look into the needs.  And of course, that requires some process, but I’m pretty confident that there is understanding about the need to work together and to address some of those issues.</p>
<p>But let me also mention another thing that is equally important than defense, and that’s energy.  I think that what we all understand that we need to work, and it is not only Latvia or Lithuania or Estonia – that’s entire European Union, Europe as a whole.  We need to work to reduce dependency on Russian gas and oil.  We discussed at some length and detail also what could be done.  And I say that here, the United States can play a critical role, and we are willing to continue.  And this region is connecting from Russia, the Russian electricity grid, and connecting to European electricity grid.  Some work is being done.  And also that means, of course, reducing dependency of gas.  But here we need a bit wider effort through LNG, through renewable energy issues.</p>
<p>So I would put now military defense and energy defense on an equal footing, and also the cyber defense, so three areas.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Did you ask for anti-aircraft assistance from NATO?</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER RINKĒVIČS:  </b>We do work on those issues, yes, we do work.  But I think that we will not go into details before there are more substantial efforts.  And we are working through NATO and with our partners on some additional needs that we see we need.  And I’m very glad that both NATO and our partners are addressing those challenges seriously.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Will, first, on the last part of your question, just to be clear – and I’m sorry if I wasn’t before, earlier today – as I said and as I just mentioned again now, we’re on a regular basis reviewing the global posture of our forces, to include of course here in Europe.  And we have to factor in any developments, any changes in the threat – and we will do that.  And when it comes to questions such as permanent basing, these questions come up and we’ll certainly look to answer them in the context of doing the review of our of our posture.  But just to be very clear, no, there’s no decision of that kind.  I was just saying that this is a question that’s come up, and we’ll, in the context of doing reviews of our posture in Europe and elsewhere, be looking at that.</p>
<p>Second, with regard to the meetings, I’ll – I’m not going to get ahead of them.  I’ll let them more or less speak for themselves, once I’ve had the chance to actually compare notes with my friend Yair Lapid later this evening here, and then with President Macron tomorrow in France.  But I think there is – there’s certainly no change in our message to Moscow, our message to Russia, to President Putin:  End the war.  End it now.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary of State, Your Excellency Minister, dear media representatives.  This concludes our press conference.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Vilnius, Lithuania</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LANDSBERGIS:</b>  (Via interpreter)  Colleagues, good morning.  I’m delighted with the opportunity to welcome the U.S. State Secretary and a good friend of mine, Antony Blinken, in Lithuania.  We had an opportunity to discuss key and most concerning issues, including Russian war against Ukraine and further actions in support to Ukraine, and how we should strengthen the security of Lithuanian and the entire region.  The Untied States, Lithuania, and other partners of the alliance are doing a lot, but we cannot stop.  We cannot afford for Ukrainian cities to become another Srebrenica, Grozny, or Aleppo.</p>
<p>Providing assistance to Ukraine has to continue.  We have to urge our partners to check their inventories to increase their orders and continue supplying assistance to Ukraine that it needs so much.  The Russia initiated war also means humanitarian as well as climate crisis, and we have to do everything that is possible to prevent the humanitarian corridors and safe areas around nuclear power plants from becoming targets of Russian war machine.  I’m happy that the U.S. is increasing its presence in the Baltic region in troops and in equipment.  U.S. troops are protecting our country, together with other NATO partners.  We know that the commitments of our – of the Allies are ironclad, and if we want to continue building even stronger NATO, politically stronger, we need to ensure security of the Baltic states.</p>
<p>Russian economic blockade has not reached total isolation level, and we heard that there were attempts to use unsanctioned banks to evade the already-existing sanctions.  So we have to close all the possible gaps.  And energy resources that we are using allows Russia to fund its military operation, and we cannot pay for oil and gas with Ukrainian blood.  The U.S. stands with Lithuania and the Baltic states.  The United States stand here with their commitments, with their troops and capabilities.  They are here in reality and not in front of a green screen with the fake microphones.</p>
<p>Together – I’m sorry – today, the Secretary’s visit shows once again that United States stands with Lithuania and the Baltic states, and it also stands with Ukraine and its people.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you very, very much.  Gabrielius, thank you so much for the warm welcome.  It’s been a real pleasure to be here to be able to spend time with the president, with the prime minister, and with you.  And I just have to say for starts, on a personal note, how much I appreciate you as a colleague, how much I appreciate the strength of your voice, your conviction in our own relationship, at NATO, throughout Europe.  It makes a big difference, and it’s greatly appreciated.  And I’m pleased to be here with our ambassador to Lithuania, Bob Gilchrist, who’s been a terrific leader for the team that I was able to meet with this morning before meeting with our colleagues in the government.</p>
<p>We’re celebrating, the United States and Lithuania, 100 years of diplomatic relations this year.  We’re NATO Allies.  We’re economic partners.  And we share together a deep commitment to democracy, to human rights, to the international rules-based order, which we recognize is the foundation of our shared security and which is being directly threatened by Russia’s unprovoked, unjustified war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Lithuanians understand the critical importance of every nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity being respected, having lived through decades of Soviet occupation, a forceful occupation that the United States always refused to recognize.  In recent years, Moscow has sought to undermine Lithuania’s democracy and sow polarization within its population through cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns.  That’s because the free, open, vibrant, prosperous society that the people of Lithuania have built since the end of Soviet occupation shows what’s possible when people choose the path of democracy over autocracy.  That’s why the United States supported and advocated for Lithuania’s membership in NATO and the European Union; and this country, Lithuania, has consistently made outsized contributions to both organizations.</p>
<p>Lithuania’s commitment to freedom was evident at the Summit for Democracy that President Biden convened late last year, where Vilnius pledged to expand its efforts to support and provide refuge for pro-democracy activists from Belarus and Russia, to promote international accountability measures for gross human rights violations, to increase support for media freedom and the safety of journalists.  How prescient and necessary those commitments proved to be.</p>
<p>In the face of the current crisis, the United States and Lithuania are united in our resolve to stand with Ukraine.  We’re surging security assistance to strengthen Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself.  We’re increasing humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people.  We’re raising the costs on the Kremlin – and all who aid and enable it – for continuing this war of choice.  And we’re bolstering our shared defense so that we and our allies are prepared to meet any threat.</p>
<p>The United States has deployed an additional 7,000 forces to Europe.  We’re repositioned forces already in Europe to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank.  That includes the extension, as of last week, of the U.S. Army’s 366 Armored Battalion, which was deployed to Lithuania in July; the deployment of F-35 strike fighters to the region to augment NATO’s enhanced air policing mission.  An addition 400 personnel from the 1st Armored Brigade combat team will be arriving in Lithuania in the days to come.</p>
<p>The United States commitment to Article 5 – an attack on one is an attack on all – that commitment is sacrosanct.  And as President Biden repeated to the American people in his State of the Union address just a few days ago, we will defend every inch of NATO territory if it comes under attack.  No one should doubt our readiness; no one should doubt our resolve.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, I authorized allies to provide U.S.-origin defense equipment to our Ukrainian partners.  Lithuania stepped up with Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, M-72 light anti-tank weapons, and other supplies to help the extraordinarily courageous Ukrainian people defend their country from Russian aggression.  Vilnius is also sending about $4 million Euros in emergency medical assistance for Ukraine – 30 truckloads packed with aid, urgently needed given the growing carnage that’s being influenced by the Kremlin’s sieges and attacks on civilians.</p>
<p>When the Lithuanian Red Cross issued a call just last week for donations to help people in Ukraine, it filled 50 trucks the very first day.  We see blue and yellow flags hanging from homes and businesses across this country.  And a Lithuanian NGO has reportedly registered nearly 6,000 households willing to take in Ukrainian refugees.  The Ukrainians who eventually arrive in Lithuania will join hundreds of anti-corruption activists, opposition politicians, journalists, human rights defenders who already have found safe haven here after being forced to flee attacks, threats, imprisonment in Russia and Belarus in recent years.</p>
<p>Vilnius is the temporary home of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the leader of Belarus’s pro-democracy movement, with whom I’ve had the privilege of meeting on several occasions, including most recently in Munich during the security conference.</p>
<p>We’re very grateful to Lithuania for hosting in the State Department’s Belarus Affairs unit, led by Ambassador Julie Fisher.  That unit is focused on supporting the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian people and holding the Lukashenka regime accountable for its widespread human rights violations.</p>
<p>Until last May, Vilnius also provided refuge for Belarusian blogger and dissident Roman Protasevich until a commercial jet that he was traveling on was intercepted by a Belarusian fighter jet and he was arbitrarily detained.  We join Lithuania in continuing to call for his immediate release and the release of all people being unjustly detained in Russia and in Belarus, including the growing number arrested for protesting the Kremlin’s ongoing war.  Yesterday alone, the Russian Government reportedly detained more than 4,600 people demonstrating against the war in 65 Russian cities and towns.</p>
<p>Vilnius recognized that a threat to the rules-based order anywhere has the potential to weaken it everywhere.  This includes the principle that every nation is free to associate with whom it chooses.  That’s why we respect and support Lithuania’s decision to expand commercial ties with Taiwan, another leading democracy.  Beijing has responded to Vilnius’s decision with economic coercion and political pressure designed to divide the European Union – and punishing Lithuania into reversing course.  We support the EU’s decision to launch a legal challenge against China at the WTO.  We have to defend the rules that keep trade fair.</p>
<p>Beijing talks a lot about the importance of upholding international order, stability, respecting sovereignty.  But from its coercion of Vilnius to its failure thus far to condemn Moscow’s flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, today and in 2014, Beijing’s actions are speaking much louder than its words.</p>
<p>The United States continues to stand by Lithuania and the right of every nation to choose its own path.  We’re supporting Lithuania as it reorients its supply chains and deepens its economic resilience.  In November we created a $600 million Export-Import Bank credit facility here, and that will help facilitate U.S. exports to Lithuania, but also help Lithuanian businesses in the sectors that have been hardest hit by the PRC’s measures like semiconductors, like biotechnology.  Our Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Jose Fernandez was just here – with colleagues from the Export-Import Bank – to support these efforts and deepen our economic cooperation.  As Lithuania continues to stand for these principles, it can count on the United States to stand with it.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>(Via interpreter)  Now is the time for questions.  Žygintas Abromaitis from Lithuanian National Television.  Žygintas Abromaitis.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b> Žygintas Abromaitis, Lithuanian national broadcaster on behalf of all Lithuanian media.  It’s a question for you, Mr. Blinken.  President Nausėda warned about World War III if Putin is not stopped, but it looks like the only war could stop him, and not sanctions or political pressure or even deterrence.  Putin is now saying that he’ll go till the end and Russia is threatening NATO countries over support of Ukraine.  You keep saying that you will defend every inch of NATO territory.  So will you send American troops to the Baltic region permanently, air defense systems?  Where is the red line after crossing it NATO will enter the war directly, and how likely Russia is ready to start a nuclear war?  And furthermore, could you confirm that Poland will send fighter jets in exchange for American F-16s?  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you very much.  A few things.  First, as I noted, in response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, one of the things we did is exactly what we said we’d do for many, many months, which is, in the event of Russian aggression, we would reinforce NATO’s eastern flank.  And that’s exactly what we’ve done, and we’re in the midst of continuing to do that now, including with the deployment of additional forces, including American forces, here to Lithuania – F-35 fighters, various pieces of important equipment, all of which is being deployed here, deployed to the other states in the Baltics.</p>
<p>At the same time, we’re continuously reviewing within NATO our defense posture, including looking at questions of extending the deployment of forces, looking at questions of more permanent deployments.  All of that is under regular review, and we’re engaged with NATO Allies in doing just that.  Gabrielius and I were just at a meeting of the NATO foreign ministers a few days ago in Brussels, and this is one of the issues, of course, that came up.</p>
<p>Second, we said a few other things for many, many months as we saw – the two of us, our countries – the likelihood of Russian aggression against Ukraine.  And even as we tried everything we could to push Russia to a diplomatic path to try to resolve whatever concerns it had that might be – that anyone would consider legitimate through diplomacy and dialogue – even as we were doing that, we said then we would be fully prepared if it chose the path of aggression. We said that we would reinforce NATO’s eastern flank – we are.  We said that we would come to the aid of Ukraine by providing it more and more assistance – we are.  We said that we impose massive consequences on Russia for its aggression – we are.  And I think those consequences, the severity of the economic sanctions and other measures that have been taken, are well beyond what I think many people anticipated and are certainly unprecedented.</p>
<p>And they are having a dramatic impact already.  We see the ruble going through the floor.  We see Russia’s credit rating coming basically to zero, to “junk status,” as we would call it.  We see its stock market shut down.  We see an exodus of virtually every leading company from Russia. All of those things are happening; they’re happening in real time.  At the same time, other steps that we’ve taken, including export controls on the most important technology that Russia needs to modernize for the future – including its defense and aerospace industries, including its energy sector – that technology is being denied to Russia.  That’s going to have a powerful impact over time.</p>
<p>We’re also seeing the effect of the assistance that we have been able to provide to Ukraine and we’re continuing to provide to Ukraine – in Ukraine – when it comes to the incredible courage they’re showing in the effectiveness they’re having in standing against Russian aggression.  So all of these things, as we said, are happening.  They’re having an impact.  Having said that, it’s also true and clear that Russia has a hugely disproportionate force compared to what Ukraine has.  It has the ability to continue to grind down the Ukrainian military and, of course, to take horrific actions against the Ukrainian people, including attacking civilians.</p>
<p>We want this to come to a stop as quickly as possible, which is why we will continue to increase pressure on Russia, continue to support Ukraine.  But as I said yesterday, even if and as Russia might win a battle in Ukraine, that doesn’t mean it’s winning the war.  If and as Russia might take a city in Ukraine, that doesn’t mean that it’s taking the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people.  It can’t; it won’t.  And whether it’s a week, whether it’s a month, whether it’s longer, I am utterly convinced that Ukraine will prevail.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to NATO, the line is very clear.  And I’ll repeat it:  If there is any aggression anywhere on NATO territory, on NATO countries, we the United States, all of our allies and partners, will take action to defend every inch of NATO territory.  It’s as clear and direct as that.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>Simon Lewis, Reuters.  Your question, please.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Thank you.  Thanks for doing this.  For Secretary Blinken, I wondered if you would be able to comment on reports that the U.S. believes that Russia has begun recruiting Syrians to fight in the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>And to the foreign minister:  Even before this invasion of Ukraine and the current tense security situation, Lithuania was already dealing with the threat from another power, from – of economic and diplomatic pressure from China over your stance towards Taiwan.  How can you balance those two threats, and what can the United States provide?  What are you asking for the United States to provide that to help you deal with both of those?  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>I’m happy to start.  Simon, I’ve seen the reports that you refer to.  I can’t confirm them at this time.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LANDSBERGIS:  </b>Well, I think that – and as Secretary Blinken mentioned – both cases are about defending a similar principle.  One power is challenging the rules-based order when it comes to the borders of other countries, when it comes to geopolitics, when it comes to the security architecture of – one might say Europe, but I would say that it’s a global architecture, because it doesn’t matter where the country is – where the country is.  Is it in the Indo-Pacific?  Is it in Europe?  Is it in any other continent?  Every country has hopes and wants guarantees that its borders, its sovereignty will not be violated.</p>
<p>The other top power is trying to bend globally agreed rules of trade and is trying to use trade as a political instrument, in some cases even as a weapon, to force countries to change the course – no matter that it’s legal, no matter that it’s a sovereign right of the country to do so.  So not by our design, Lithuania becomes a case of defending both principles and becomes a country which in some cases leads by example what it means to defend the global rules-based order, be it geopolitical or economic.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Vilnius, Lithuania</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LANDSBERGIS:</b>  (Via interpreter)  Colleagues, good morning.  I’m delighted with the opportunity to welcome the U.S. State Secretary and a good friend of mine, Antony Blinken, in Lithuania.  We had an opportunity to discuss key and most concerning issues, including Russian war against Ukraine and further actions in support to Ukraine, and how we should strengthen the security of Lithuanian and the entire region.  The Untied States, Lithuania, and other partners of the alliance are doing a lot, but we cannot stop.  We cannot afford for Ukrainian cities to become another Srebrenica, Grozny, or Aleppo.</p>
<p>Providing assistance to Ukraine has to continue.  We have to urge our partners to check their inventories to increase their orders and continue supplying assistance to Ukraine that it needs so much.  The Russia initiated war also means humanitarian as well as climate crisis, and we have to do everything that is possible to prevent the humanitarian corridors and safe areas around nuclear power plants from becoming targets of Russian war machine.  I’m happy that the U.S. is increasing its presence in the Baltic region in troops and in equipment.  U.S. troops are protecting our country, together with other NATO partners.  We know that the commitments of our – of the Allies are ironclad, and if we want to continue building even stronger NATO, politically stronger, we need to ensure security of the Baltic states.</p>
<p>Russian economic blockade has not reached total isolation level, and we heard that there were attempts to use unsanctioned banks to evade the already-existing sanctions.  So we have to close all the possible gaps.  And energy resources that we are using allows Russia to fund its military operation, and we cannot pay for oil and gas with Ukrainian blood.  The U.S. stands with Lithuania and the Baltic states.  The United States stand here with their commitments, with their troops and capabilities.  They are here in reality and not in front of a green screen with the fake microphones.</p>
<p>Together – I’m sorry – today, the Secretary’s visit shows once again that United States stands with Lithuania and the Baltic states, and it also stands with Ukraine and its people.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you very, very much.  Gabrielius, thank you so much for the warm welcome.  It’s been a real pleasure to be here to be able to spend time with the president, with the prime minister, and with you.  And I just have to say for starts, on a personal note, how much I appreciate you as a colleague, how much I appreciate the strength of your voice, your conviction in our own relationship, at NATO, throughout Europe.  It makes a big difference, and it’s greatly appreciated.  And I’m pleased to be here with our ambassador to Lithuania, Bob Gilchrist, who’s been a terrific leader for the team that I was able to meet with this morning before meeting with our colleagues in the government.</p>
<p>We’re celebrating, the United States and Lithuania, 100 years of diplomatic relations this year.  We’re NATO Allies.  We’re economic partners.  And we share together a deep commitment to democracy, to human rights, to the international rules-based order, which we recognize is the foundation of our shared security and which is being directly threatened by Russia’s unprovoked, unjustified war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Lithuanians understand the critical importance of every nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity being respected, having lived through decades of Soviet occupation, a forceful occupation that the United States always refused to recognize.  In recent years, Moscow has sought to undermine Lithuania’s democracy and sow polarization within its population through cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns.  That’s because the free, open, vibrant, prosperous society that the people of Lithuania have built since the end of Soviet occupation shows what’s possible when people choose the path of democracy over autocracy.  That’s why the United States supported and advocated for Lithuania’s membership in NATO and the European Union; and this country, Lithuania, has consistently made outsized contributions to both organizations.</p>
<p>Lithuania’s commitment to freedom was evident at the Summit for Democracy that President Biden convened late last year, where Vilnius pledged to expand its efforts to support and provide refuge for pro-democracy activists from Belarus and Russia, to promote international accountability measures for gross human rights violations, to increase support for media freedom and the safety of journalists.  How prescient and necessary those commitments proved to be.</p>
<p>In the face of the current crisis, the United States and Lithuania are united in our resolve to stand with Ukraine.  We’re surging security assistance to strengthen Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself.  We’re increasing humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people.  We’re raising the costs on the Kremlin – and all who aid and enable it – for continuing this war of choice.  And we’re bolstering our shared defense so that we and our allies are prepared to meet any threat.</p>
<p>The United States has deployed an additional 7,000 forces to Europe.  We’re repositioned forces already in Europe to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank.  That includes the extension, as of last week, of the U.S. Army’s 366 Armored Battalion, which was deployed to Lithuania in July; the deployment of F-35 strike fighters to the region to augment NATO’s enhanced air policing mission.  An addition 400 personnel from the 1st Armored Brigade combat team will be arriving in Lithuania in the days to come.</p>
<p>The United States commitment to Article 5 – an attack on one is an attack on all – that commitment is sacrosanct.  And as President Biden repeated to the American people in his State of the Union address just a few days ago, we will defend every inch of NATO territory if it comes under attack.  No one should doubt our readiness; no one should doubt our resolve.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, I authorized allies to provide U.S.-origin defense equipment to our Ukrainian partners.  Lithuania stepped up with Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, M-72 light anti-tank weapons, and other supplies to help the extraordinarily courageous Ukrainian people defend their country from Russian aggression.  Vilnius is also sending about $4 million Euros in emergency medical assistance for Ukraine – 30 truckloads packed with aid, urgently needed given the growing carnage that’s being influenced by the Kremlin’s sieges and attacks on civilians.</p>
<p>When the Lithuanian Red Cross issued a call just last week for donations to help people in Ukraine, it filled 50 trucks the very first day.  We see blue and yellow flags hanging from homes and businesses across this country.  And a Lithuanian NGO has reportedly registered nearly 6,000 households willing to take in Ukrainian refugees.  The Ukrainians who eventually arrive in Lithuania will join hundreds of anti-corruption activists, opposition politicians, journalists, human rights defenders who already have found safe haven here after being forced to flee attacks, threats, imprisonment in Russia and Belarus in recent years.</p>
<p>Vilnius is the temporary home of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the leader of Belarus’s pro-democracy movement, with whom I’ve had the privilege of meeting on several occasions, including most recently in Munich during the security conference.</p>
<p>We’re very grateful to Lithuania for hosting in the State Department’s Belarus Affairs unit, led by Ambassador Julie Fisher.  That unit is focused on supporting the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian people and holding the Lukashenka regime accountable for its widespread human rights violations.</p>
<p>Until last May, Vilnius also provided refuge for Belarusian blogger and dissident Roman Protasevich until a commercial jet that he was traveling on was intercepted by a Belarusian fighter jet and he was arbitrarily detained.  We join Lithuania in continuing to call for his immediate release and the release of all people being unjustly detained in Russia and in Belarus, including the growing number arrested for protesting the Kremlin’s ongoing war.  Yesterday alone, the Russian Government reportedly detained more than 4,600 people demonstrating against the war in 65 Russian cities and towns.</p>
<p>Vilnius recognized that a threat to the rules-based order anywhere has the potential to weaken it everywhere.  This includes the principle that every nation is free to associate with whom it chooses.  That’s why we respect and support Lithuania’s decision to expand commercial ties with Taiwan, another leading democracy.  Beijing has responded to Vilnius’s decision with economic coercion and political pressure designed to divide the European Union – and punishing Lithuania into reversing course.  We support the EU’s decision to launch a legal challenge against China at the WTO.  We have to defend the rules that keep trade fair.</p>
<p>Beijing talks a lot about the importance of upholding international order, stability, respecting sovereignty.  But from its coercion of Vilnius to its failure thus far to condemn Moscow’s flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, today and in 2014, Beijing’s actions are speaking much louder than its words.</p>
<p>The United States continues to stand by Lithuania and the right of every nation to choose its own path.  We’re supporting Lithuania as it reorients its supply chains and deepens its economic resilience.  In November we created a $600 million Export-Import Bank credit facility here, and that will help facilitate U.S. exports to Lithuania, but also help Lithuanian businesses in the sectors that have been hardest hit by the PRC’s measures like semiconductors, like biotechnology.  Our Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Jose Fernandez was just here – with colleagues from the Export-Import Bank – to support these efforts and deepen our economic cooperation.  As Lithuania continues to stand for these principles, it can count on the United States to stand with it.  Thank you.</p>

<p>Vilnius, Lithuania</p>
<p>Presidentura</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT NAUSEDA:  </strong>(Inaudible.)  Mr. Secretary, appreciate your visit to Vilnius.  Thankful for support of President Biden and you personally, Secretary, extend to Lithuania.  Always good to talk to a closest friend and ally.  I hope that the leaders of the Baltic countries will meet President Biden later this year to mark the 100th-year anniversary of the diplomatic relations between the United States and Lithuania.  And I think it will be very a very good opportunity to debut our U.S.-Baltic charter.</p>
<p>Thank you also for your leadership in uniting the world and for heavy support you bring.  Unfortunately, worsening security situation in the Baltic region is of great concern to – on all of us and around the globe.  Russia’s reckless aggression against Ukraine once again proves that it is a long-term threat to the European security, the security of the entire alliance, no matter how and when the war in Ukraine ends.  Furthermore, the fact of obstruction of Belarus and Russia is an additional very dangerous factor for us, for the region.  And probably this is a very good opportunity to rethink, rethink the alliance response, alliance defense plans, procedures.  And I’m happy to conclude that this process is underway.</p>
<p>I must say that, Antony, deterrence is no longer enough, and we need more defense here (inaudible), because otherwise it will be too late here, Mr. Secretary.  Putin will not stop in Ukraine; he will not stop.  It is our collective duty and obligation to help (inaudible) Ukrainians live all peace available by saying: all I need and need, all needs – if you want to avoid the third world war.  The choice is in our hands.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Mr. President, thank you very much.  Thank you for receiving us today.  Thank you for the historic partnership between our countries that, indeed, goes back a hundred years (inaudible) the extraordinary ups and downs (inaudible).  But throughout, we’ve been together, and we remain together in this moment, this a moment of tremendous challenge as a result of Russia’s unprovoked, unwarranted, premediated aggression against Ukraine, but also along with extraordinary solidarity.  We have seen countries throughout Europe, across the Atlantic, and, indeed, around the world come together in condemnation of Russia’s aggression and its support for Ukraine.  We’ve seen the alliance that we are both (inaudible) come together, not only in support of Ukraine, but also in reaffirmation of our common (inaudible) to Article 5, (inaudible) commitment that President Biden feels absolutely is sacrosanct.  An attack on one is an attack on all.  The United States, with all allies and partners, will defend every – every inch of NATO territory should it come under attack, and there should be no doubt about that on anyone’s mind.</p>
<p>To your point, we have a moment where not only is the solidarity necessary, but it&#8217;s also important to think (inaudible) how you approach our common (inaudible) – through NATO, together in our partnership – and that work is being done (inaudible).  But meanwhile, the most urgent matter is supporting our friends in Ukraine against this aggression.  Increasing pressure on Russia to stop this war of aggression – and doing everything we can (inaudible) to strengthen our alliance and ensure that it’s prepared for anything.  NATO has no aggressive intent, does not to seek out conflict, has never sought conflict, but we will always be prepared (inaudible).  Thank you.  (Inaudible) talking about these things in more detail.  Thank you.<input type="hidden" data-filter="1110000001" /></p>

<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Mr. President, thank you very much.  Thank you for receiving us today.  Thank you for the historic partnership between our countries that, indeed, goes back a hundred years (inaudible) the extraordinary ups and downs (inaudible).  But throughout, we’ve been together, and we remain together in this moment, this a moment of tremendous challenge as a result of Russia’s unprovoked, unwarranted, premediated aggression against Ukraine, but also along with extraordinary solidarity.  We have seen countries throughout Europe, across the Atlantic, and, indeed, around the world come together in condemnation of Russia’s aggression and its support for Ukraine.  We’ve seen the alliance that we are both (inaudible) come together, not only in support of Ukraine, but also in reaffirmation of our common (inaudible) to Article 5, (inaudible) commitment that President Biden feels absolutely is sacrosanct.  An attack on one is an attack on all.  The United States, with all allies and partners, will defend every – every inch of NATO territory should it come under attack, and there should be no doubt about that on anyone’s mind.</p>
<p>To your point, we have a moment where not only is the solidarity necessary, but it&#8217;s also important to think (inaudible) how you approach our common (inaudible) – through NATO, together in our partnership – and that work is being done (inaudible).  But meanwhile, the most urgent matter is supporting our friends in Ukraine against this aggression.  Increasing pressure on Russia to stop this war of aggression – and doing everything we can (inaudible) to strengthen our alliance and ensure that it’s prepared for anything.  NATO has no aggressive intent, does not to seek out conflict, has never sought conflict, but we will always be prepared (inaudible).  Thank you.  (Inaudible) talking about these things in more detail.  Thank you.<input type="hidden" data-filter="1110000001" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Wendy R. Sherman, Deputy Secretary of State</p>
<p>Madrid, Spain</p>
<p><em>As prepared   </em></p>
<p>Good morning. It’s wonderful to be here with all of you.</p>
<p>I want to begin by thanking my good friend, State Secretary Angeles Moreno Bau, for hosting us today for the first-ever Spain-U.S. Cybersecurity Seminar.</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe that it’s been less than a year since I was sworn in as Deputy Secretary and Angeles and I began working closely together, given how frequently we have reason to collaborate.</p>
<p>Spain was an extraordinary partner to the United States in the unprecedented effort to evacuate more than 120,000 people from Afghanistan last August, including by enabling the U.S. military to temporarily host thousands of Afghans at Rota and Moron. Angeles was absolutely essential to making that possible.</p>
<p>Now, of course, Angeles and I are in constant communication about Ukraine, and the premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war of choice that Vladimir Putin has unleashed there.</p>
<p>As a staunch NATO Ally and EU member state, Spain’s leadership is key to the transatlantic effort—really, the global effort—to impose severe, coordinated costs and consequences for President Putin’s war of choice, and to urge an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine.</p>
<p>And, of course, Spain will host the NATO Summit in June—a critical gathering at a critical moment for Europe, for the transatlantic Alliance, and for the entire world.</p>
<p>After so many video conferences and phone calls, it’s a pleasure to be here in Madrid with you, Angeles, for this important and very timely event.</p>
<p>I also want to thank Economy Ministry State Secretary Carme Artigas for joining today’s discussion. Cyber and technology policy issues cut across both foreign and domestic policy in Spain and the United States alike, so we are very fortunate to have both perspectives at the table today.</p>
<p>Thank you as well to Spanish Ambassador-at-large for Cybersecurity Nicolas Pascual de la Parte for proposing today’s event, and for the months of diplomatic and policy spadework to make it happen.</p>
<p>And finally, I want to acknowledge the United States’ exceptional Ambassador to Spain, Julissa Reynoso, for her work and the U.S. Embassy’s support of today’s event.</p>
<p>The digital technology revolution is happening all around us—but too many governments haven’t been keeping pace.</p>
<p>In recent years, we have seen increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyber incidents that violate consumers’ privacy, undermine our businesses’ competitiveness, and even threaten the security of our critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>We have seen more countries using the incredible powers of the Internet not to bring people together, but to suppress people’s freedoms.</p>
<p>We have seen all too painfully how digital technologies can be used as tools of surveillance and disinformation—and even to undermine democratic norms and institutions.</p>
<p>All of those trends mean that the United States has a vested national security interest in making sure the digital revolution benefits the American people and our allies and partners. That this transformation serves to strengthen the rules-based international order, not to undercut it.</p>
<p>For anyone who may have been skeptical that cyber and tech issues are major foreign policy issues for the 21st century, we need only to look at Ukraine and Russia right now.</p>
<p>As Russia moved tens of thousands of troops toward Ukraine’s borders, we also saw one of the largest malicious cyber incidents in Ukraine’s history, targeting government ministries and major banks. We were able to trace that activity to Russian intelligence services. Since 2014, malicious Kremlin-backed cyber activity have repeatedly hit Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, including the power grid and financial system.</p>
<p>That is why the United States has long included cybersecurity capacity-building investments in our security assistance to Ukraine, providing $40 million since 2017 to help grow Ukraine’s IT sector, build resilience, and strengthen the information security environment.</p>
<p>Our NATO Allies and European partners have also made significant contributions to help improve Ukraine’s cybersecurity.</p>
<p>And those investments have concretely helped Ukraine keep their Internet on and information flowing, even in the midst of a brutal Russian invasion.</p>
<p>Since President Putin directed his troops to invade Ukraine, we’ve also seen Russia taking extraordinary steps to crack down on internet freedom in their own country.</p>
<p>The Kremlin first throttled access to certain social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, and then blocked them entirely. They have barred news outlets from using words like “war” and “invasion.”</p>
<p>And President Putin just signed a law threatening up to 15 years in jail for anyone—journalists and ordinary citizens alike—who posts the truth about what Russia is doing in Ukraine.</p>
<p>As this war continues to sow chaos and carnage in Ukraine—and as President Putin becomes increasingly determined to control the Russian people—I fear we can expect to see even more cyberattacks, with implications for Ukraine and beyond, and certainly even more efforts to clamp down on free expression in Russia.</p>
<p>So, today’s Spain-U.S. Cybersecurity Seminar comes at an appropriate moment.</p>
<p>We need to work together to promote a global framework for how nations behave in cyberspace—to promote lasting peace, and prevent further conflict.</p>
<p>We need to hold malicious cyber actors—whether state-sponsored or private—accountable for their actions, because cyberattacks are not victimless crimes.</p>
<p>We need to help other countries build their own capacity to withstand cyberattacks that could damage their security, their economies, and their citizens’ trust.</p>
<p>We need to invest in innovation in the United States, in Spain, and in other likeminded democracies—so the tools and technologies of the future are built to expand opportunity, not diminish freedom.</p>
<p>And we need to defend and promote our values in cyberspace, just as we do in countries and organizations around the world. To uphold human rights and human dignity. To advocate for freedom of speech and freedom of the press. To facilitate the free flow of information between countries and continents.</p>
<p>The Internet and cyber technologies can be incredibly powerful enablers of truth, freedom, trust, and human connection.</p>
<p>We see that every time President Zelenskyy rallies the Ukrainian people with his video posts. Every time an online platform like Airbnb is used to help find housing for a family seeking refuge. Every time ordinary Ukrainians use Telegram or Twitter to show the world the truth of what President Putin’s war means on the ground.</p>
<p>It’s up to us to build the future of cyberspace and technology that we want to see.</p>
<p>At the State Department, Secretary Blinken has made elevating cyber and emerging technology issues a top priority.</p>
<p>Last year, we held wide-ranging consultations and conversations as part of a comprehensive review of cyberspace and emerging technology policy and organization at the State Department. And we consistently heard a few things.</p>
<p>First, just about everyone recognized that the United States urgently needs to strengthen our international leadership on cybersecurity, emerging technology, and digital policy.</p>
<p>Second, we heard that it isn’t sufficient to only focus on countering cyberattacks, or investing in innovation—we need to integrate our economic policy, our national security policy, and our values into a balanced approach to technology.</p>
<p>And third, we need to advance our diplomatic agenda in collaboration with our allies and partners.</p>
<p>As a result of this work, Secretary Blinken announced last fall that we will create a new Bureau for Cyberspace and Digital Policy and a new Special Envoy for Critical and Emerging Technologies.</p>
<p>Congress recently approved our plans, and we are actively working to stand up these new offices.</p>
<p>We’ll be advancing this agenda technology-by-technology, issue-by-issue, both within the U.S. government as well as with our allies and partners around the world—including, of course, our friends here in Spain.</p>
<p>So thank you again, Angeles, and your colleagues, for organizing today’s events. I know our delegations will have lively and useful discussions throughout the day, with each other and with the business and civil society leaders who will be joining for the afternoon’s sessions. We look forward to continued close collaboration and partnership between the United States and Spain on these issues.</p>
<p>Thank you. <input type="hidden" data-filter="1111110011" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Chisinau, Moldova</p>
<p>Novitas</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR LOGSDON:</strong>  All right.  So, Secretary Blinken, welcome back to Chisinau.  We’re glad to have you here.  You all know the Secretary has had multiple positions at the Department of State, and we’re glad to have him back this time at the helm of the Department of State.  It’s very great.</p>
<p>I’m here to introduce him to you, but I also want to introduce you to him.  This is an amazing team.  The last time a secretary of state visited us was 2013, so we’ve been waiting a while – no pressure – and it’s also one month from today that Michelle and I arrived.  So thanks for dropping in to celebrate our one-month anniversary.  I appreciate that.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>We have another VIP visitor here today, Carol Spahn, the acting director of the Peace Corps.  Very happy to have you.  (Applause.)  Peace Corps Moldova is one of the most successful Peace Corps programs I think in the world, and we’re eager to have the volunteers back, so no pressure, Carol.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>February 18th, we celebrated 30 years of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Moldova and the United States.  It was an exciting time.  Obviously, we didn’t get a lot of time to celebrate it because of everything that’s been happening in the region, but it was a really important 30 years and we have another 30 years ahead.  It’s a historic moment, historic opportunity, and we’re really glad to have the Secretary here to celebrate it with us.</p>
<p>That said, I’d have to take a moment and talk about COVID.  This community has really dealt with a very difficult past two years, especially under Chargé Laura Hruby’s leadership.  Well, we’ve lost people, lost people in our community, and we know that.  It’s been really tough.  So we want to go forward, but we also know that it’s been a tough time.</p>
<p>One more important aspect of this community I want to highlight, Mr. Secretary, is what this community has done to be part of the community here in Moldova, in Chisinau, taking care of the literally hundreds of thousands now of refugees from Ukraine who’ve crossed the border into Moldova over the last week.  This community organized, they jumped up, they said what can we do to help.  They connected with a former Peace Corps volunteer and his local business partner at a restaurant here, and they started collecting.  They started collecting everything you need – blankets, sheets, baby goods, food.  It’s been amazing, and I have to take just a minute and highlight Hannah Gardi for the work she’s done as really our (inaudible).  (Applause.)  So Hannah, thank you for your leadership.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary, thank you again for coming back to Moldova.  All of us here in the room, on the screen, we appreciate what you’re doing, what you’ve done for us, and we look forward to welcoming you back again very soon.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It is wonderful to see you all in this room.  So now I think I have a new way of saying this.  I used to say it’s great to meet mask to mask; now it’s great to meet at least face to mask, and we’re getting there.  By the way, back in Washington at Main State, following the rules of the District of Columbia, we’ve once again taken our masks off, and hopefully that will last.  The State Department is coming back piece by piece, bit by bit to where it needs to be – cafeteria reopening, various other important landmarks like the sort of Starbucks hopefully coming back online.</p>
<p>But I’m really here for a couple of reasons.  The main reason, and I’ll come to that, is simply to say thank you, thank you to each and every one of you for the remarkable service that you’re performing for our country and for this relationship between the United States and the Republic of Moldova.  Kent, it seems like a month ago – and it was – that we were sending you off, and things were a little bit different then, so I guess timing in life is everything.  You can decide whether the timing was good or something else, but in all seriousness, it is so great to have both of you here representing the country, leading this mission.  It’s making a huge difference at a time when that could not be more important.</p>
<p>And Laura, thank you so much for your extraordinary leadership here as well.  I’ll come back to that in a minute too, but this has been in so many ways a challenging time for missions around the world and certainly here as well.  And Carol, it’s great to be with you today.  I second what Kent said.  No pressure, but I definitely second that.</p>
<p>And to everyone here in the room, our family members and other colleagues who are there with us virtually, it is great to be back.  I was here I think almost exactly seven years ago, and some things have changed, other things haven’t.  It was particularly meaningful to me to see one of my favorite landmarks, the Malldova.  (Laughter.)  So whoever came up with that gets big points in my book.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, why are we here right now?  We’re here first and foremost because we are dealing with an egregious aggression by Russia against Ukraine, but an aggression that, of course, is having a horrific impact on the Ukrainian people – men, women, children – many of whom we saw just yesterday in Poland at the border, many of whom you’re seeing every single day here in Moldova, who’ve been forced to flee the violence; but also an impact on the very international order that we have worked so hard over so many decades to try to maintain, as imperfectly as we do it.</p>
<p>What Russia is doing, what Vladimir Putin is doing, is not only terrible violence to men, women, and children.  He’s doing terrible violence to the very principles that lie beneath that order and are working to keep peace and security around the world.  And, simply put, we can’t let either of those things go forward with impunity, because if we do, it opens a Pandora’s box that we will deeply, deeply regret not just in Europe but potentially around the world.</p>
<p>It’s basic principles that underlie the order, include the proposition that countries are entitled to sovereignty, to decide for themselves what their policies will be, with whom they’ll associate, to have their – the integrity of their borders respected, to basically allow their own people to decide their own future.  And all of that is on the line with this aggression.</p>
<p>But all of that equally applies here to the Republic of Moldova, and just as we’re standing strongly for Ukraine, for its territorial integrity, its independence, its sovereignty, so too do we stand with Moldova and any other country that may be threatened in the same way.  And that’s very much the message that I brought to the president, the prime minister, the foreign minister today.  It’s important that our friends here in Moldova understand that we and the world are with them too.</p>
<p>And I hope that at the very least one of the things that President Putin has seen in the unprecedented response to the aggression in Ukraine from virtually the entirety of the international community, starting with the United States and European allies and partners through NATO, the European Union, the OSCE, the G7, but also most of the international community – 141 countries at the United Nations standing up and saying we condemn this aggression and we stand with Ukraine – I hope that message is not lost on him, because it applies not just to Ukraine.  It would apply everywhere that we might face such aggression, including here.</p>
<p>What you’re doing every day, before this episode, now during it, and after it, is extraordinary because it’s supporting a relationship with an extraordinary country.  I have to tell you – and I suspect many of you feel the same way – it’s inspiring to see the work that our friends here are doing.  At a time in the world when over the last decade or 15 years we’ve seen in many places democratic backsliding, in country after country – we’ve had our own challenges – here in Moldova, we see a country with extraordinary leaders trying to move forward, to strengthen their democracy, to build it, and in so doing, of course, benefit the people of Moldova, but also set an example for the world.  So it’s a small country, but it is setting a very big example.</p>
<p>And you are a critical part of making that happen, because the work that you’re doing, the support you’re providing, the guidance you’re giving, all of that I think is essential to the success of this project.  And I just want to thank you for doing it.</p>
<p>I also know that under normal times, a visit by me or by someone from Washington puts a little extra burden on an embassy.  This is not an ordinary time.  I know people have been driving back and forth, three hours each way, to the border, including to help bring some of our folks back and forth.  Some of you will be doing that in just a short while.  At the same time, helping the refugees who are coming in, helping our Moldovan friends help them, and that support is extraordinary, and I really want to thank you as well because I know we’ve added to the burden.</p>
<p>And I know that some people in particular have been doing exceptional things.  Is Valeriu Cernea here?  Maybe on the screen?  I wanted to single out Valeriu and also Sam Ludwig – anywhere here today?  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>We have alumni from our exchange programs who are helping refugees as we speak.  They are part of a community.  Even after the exchange programs, their participation ends, it carries on.  They’re out there doing it.  We have, I know, family members who are with us on the screen who, as Kent said, have been delivering blankets, food, baby clothes to refugee centers.  We have the lifeblood of this and any embassy, our locally employed staff, opening their homes to refugees from Ukraine.  All of that is extraordinary even as it may seem ordinary to you because it’s just what you do.</p>
<p>And then, as Kent said, I know that the last two years have been difficult – more than difficult – because of COVID, and you’ve experienced loss.  You’ve managed despite that to carry on with incredible resilience, looking out for each other, having each other’s backs, delivering hundreds of thousands of COVID vaccines here to our friends in Moldova, working with civil society and the new government on all of the work they’re doing to tackle corruption, leading efforts to support an independent media throughout Moldova, and again, doing that at a time of personal challenge as well as professional challenge.</p>
<p>And I took note of some of the things that people have been doing, and again, they may seem small, but they have a big impact: providing groceries, providing child care when someone got sick as a result of COVID, keeping in touch through WhatsApp, finding some ways even in the midst of this to have fun, virtual wine tastings – I’m not quite sure how that works.  (Laughter.)  Chili cookoffs; something that I’d appreciate learning, how to make (inaudible) workshops – all of these things make a huge difference, because it creates a sense of community, it creates a sense of camaraderie, it creates a sense of caring for each other, and especially in challenging times that makes all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>So let me conclude by saying this:  As the ambassador said, we are celebrating 30 years of diplomatic relations with Moldova last month.  And as I mentioned a moment ago, we have local staff who’ve been serving with us since 1993.  Think about that.  That’s pretty extraordinary.  And let me see if any of them are actually in the room with us today.</p>
<p>Nicolai Jomiru – here, or maybe on the screen?  I’m just going to read off a couple names I really want to acknowledge because of this extraordinary service.  Constantin Mutaf, anywhere with us today?  I’m going to – we’re going to applaud all of them.  Vlad Cojuhari?  Here?  No?  All right.  Eduard Pirlea.  Dorin Trestianu.  All right.  Finally we got one.  (Applause.)  Aurel Veiru.  Yes.  (Applause.)  Please accept those applause on behalf of your other colleagues as well.  (Laughter.)  I’m glad.  I was getting worried.</p>
<p>But seriously, I really can’t thank each of you and each of your other colleagues who’ve been with us so long – I can’t find the words to express how much that means.  We’re so grateful for this partnership, for this service.  It makes all the difference in the world.  And let me just say to everyone here, whether you are local staff or whether you’re family, whether you’re an FSO, a civil servant; whether you’re State, Defense, USAID, Peace Corps, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Chisinau, Moldova</p>
<p>Novitas</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR LOGSDON:</strong>  All right.  So, Secretary Blinken, welcome back to Chisinau.  We’re glad to have you here.  You all know the Secretary has had multiple positions at the Department of State, and we’re glad to have him back this time at the helm of the Department of State.  It’s very great.</p>
<p>I’m here to introduce him to you, but I also want to introduce you to him.  This is an amazing team.  The last time a secretary of state visited us was 2013, so we’ve been waiting a while – no pressure – and it’s also one month from today that Michelle and I arrived.  So thanks for dropping in to celebrate our one-month anniversary.  I appreciate that.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>We have another VIP visitor here today, Carol Spahn, the acting director of the Peace Corps.  Very happy to have you.  (Applause.)  Peace Corps Moldova is one of the most successful Peace Corps programs I think in the world, and we’re eager to have the volunteers back, so no pressure, Carol.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>February 18th, we celebrated 30 years of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Moldova and the United States.  It was an exciting time.  Obviously, we didn’t get a lot of time to celebrate it because of everything that’s been happening in the region, but it was a really important 30 years and we have another 30 years ahead.  It’s a historic moment, historic opportunity, and we’re really glad to have the Secretary here to celebrate it with us.</p>
<p>That said, I’d have to take a moment and talk about COVID.  This community has really dealt with a very difficult past two years, especially under Chargé Laura Hruby’s leadership.  Well, we’ve lost people, lost people in our community, and we know that.  It’s been really tough.  So we want to go forward, but we also know that it’s been a tough time.</p>
<p>One more important aspect of this community I want to highlight, Mr. Secretary, is what this community has done to be part of the community here in Moldova, in Chisinau, taking care of the literally hundreds of thousands now of refugees from Ukraine who’ve crossed the border into Moldova over the last week.  This community organized, they jumped up, they said what can we do to help.  They connected with a former Peace Corps volunteer and his local business partner at a restaurant here, and they started collecting.  They started collecting everything you need – blankets, sheets, baby goods, food.  It’s been amazing, and I have to take just a minute and highlight Hannah Gardi for the work she’s done as really our (inaudible).  (Applause.)  So Hannah, thank you for your leadership.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary, thank you again for coming back to Moldova.  All of us here in the room, on the screen, we appreciate what you’re doing, what you’ve done for us, and we look forward to welcoming you back again very soon.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It is wonderful to see you all in this room.  So now I think I have a new way of saying this.  I used to say it’s great to meet mask to mask; now it’s great to meet at least face to mask, and we’re getting there.  By the way, back in Washington at Main State, following the rules of the District of Columbia, we’ve once again taken our masks off, and hopefully that will last.  The State Department is coming back piece by piece, bit by bit to where it needs to be – cafeteria reopening, various other important landmarks like the sort of Starbucks hopefully coming back online.</p>
<p>But I’m really here for a couple of reasons.  The main reason, and I’ll come to that, is simply to say thank you, thank you to each and every one of you for the remarkable service that you’re performing for our country and for this relationship between the United States and the Republic of Moldova.  Kent, it seems like a month ago – and it was – that we were sending you off, and things were a little bit different then, so I guess timing in life is everything.  You can decide whether the timing was good or something else, but in all seriousness, it is so great to have both of you here representing the country, leading this mission.  It’s making a huge difference at a time when that could not be more important.</p>
<p>And Laura, thank you so much for your extraordinary leadership here as well.  I’ll come back to that in a minute too, but this has been in so many ways a challenging time for missions around the world and certainly here as well.  And Carol, it’s great to be with you today.  I second what Kent said.  No pressure, but I definitely second that.</p>
<p>And to everyone here in the room, our family members and other colleagues who are there with us virtually, it is great to be back.  I was here I think almost exactly seven years ago, and some things have changed, other things haven’t.  It was particularly meaningful to me to see one of my favorite landmarks, the Malldova.  (Laughter.)  So whoever came up with that gets big points in my book.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, why are we here right now?  We’re here first and foremost because we are dealing with an egregious aggression by Russia against Ukraine, but an aggression that, of course, is having a horrific impact on the Ukrainian people – men, women, children – many of whom we saw just yesterday in Poland at the border, many of whom you’re seeing every single day here in Moldova, who’ve been forced to flee the violence; but also an impact on the very international order that we have worked so hard over so many decades to try to maintain, as imperfectly as we do it.</p>
<p>What Russia is doing, what Vladimir Putin is doing, is not only terrible violence to men, women, and children.  He’s doing terrible violence to the very principles that lie beneath that order and are working to keep peace and security around the world.  And, simply put, we can’t let either of those things go forward with impunity, because if we do, it opens a Pandora’s box that we will deeply, deeply regret not just in Europe but potentially around the world.</p>
<p>It’s basic principles that underlie the order, include the proposition that countries are entitled to sovereignty, to decide for themselves what their policies will be, with whom they’ll associate, to have their – the integrity of their borders respected, to basically allow their own people to decide their own future.  And all of that is on the line with this aggression.</p>
<p>But all of that equally applies here to the Republic of Moldova, and just as we’re standing strongly for Ukraine, for its territorial integrity, its independence, its sovereignty, so too do we stand with Moldova and any other country that may be threatened in the same way.  And that’s very much the message that I brought to the president, the prime minister, the foreign minister today.  It’s important that our friends here in Moldova understand that we and the world are with them too.</p>
<p>And I hope that at the very least one of the things that President Putin has seen in the unprecedented response to the aggression in Ukraine from virtually the entirety of the international community, starting with the United States and European allies and partners through NATO, the European Union, the OSCE, the G7, but also most of the international community – 141 countries at the United Nations standing up and saying we condemn this aggression and we stand with Ukraine – I hope that message is not lost on him, because it applies not just to Ukraine.  It would apply everywhere that we might face such aggression, including here.</p>
<p>What you’re doing every day, before this episode, now during it, and after it, is extraordinary because it’s supporting a relationship with an extraordinary country.  I have to tell you – and I suspect many of you feel the same way – it’s inspiring to see the work that our friends here are doing.  At a time in the world when over the last decade or 15 years we’ve seen in many places democratic backsliding, in country after country – we’ve had our own challenges – here in Moldova, we see a country with extraordinary leaders trying to move forward, to strengthen their democracy, to build it, and in so doing, of course, benefit the people of Moldova, but also set an example for the world.  So it’s a small country, but it is setting a very big example.</p>
<p>And you are a critical part of making that happen, because the work that you’re doing, the support you’re providing, the guidance you’re giving, all of that I think is essential to the success of this project.  And I just want to thank you for doing it.</p>
<p>I also know that under normal times, a visit by me or by someone from Washington puts a little extra burden on an embassy.  This is not an ordinary time.  I know people have been driving back and forth, three hours each way, to the border, including to help bring some of our folks back and forth.  Some of you will be doing that in just a short while.  At the same time, helping the refugees who are coming in, helping our Moldovan friends help them, and that support is extraordinary, and I really want to thank you as well because I know we’ve added to the burden.</p>
<p>And I know that some people in particular have been doing exceptional things.  Is Valeriu Cernea here?  Maybe on the screen?  I wanted to single out Valeriu and also Sam Ludwig – anywhere here today?  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>We have alumni from our exchange programs who are helping refugees as we speak.  They are part of a community.  Even after the exchange programs, their participation ends, it carries on.  They’re out there doing it.  We have, I know, family members who are with us on the screen who, as Kent said, have been delivering blankets, food, baby clothes to refugee centers.  We have the lifeblood of this and any embassy, our locally employed staff, opening their homes to refugees from Ukraine.  All of that is extraordinary even as it may seem ordinary to you because it’s just what you do.</p>
<p>And then, as Kent said, I know that the last two years have been difficult – more than difficult – because of COVID, and you’ve experienced loss.  You’ve managed despite that to carry on with incredible resilience, looking out for each other, having each other’s backs, delivering hundreds of thousands of COVID vaccines here to our friends in Moldova, working with civil society and the new government on all of the work they’re doing to tackle corruption, leading efforts to support an independent media throughout Moldova, and again, doing that at a time of personal challenge as well as professional challenge.</p>
<p>And I took note of some of the things that people have been doing, and again, they may seem small, but they have a big impact: providing groceries, providing child care when someone got sick as a result of COVID, keeping in touch through WhatsApp, finding some ways even in the midst of this to have fun, virtual wine tastings – I’m not quite sure how that works.  (Laughter.)  Chili cookoffs; something that I’d appreciate learning, how to make (inaudible) workshops – all of these things make a huge difference, because it creates a sense of community, it creates a sense of camaraderie, it creates a sense of caring for each other, and especially in challenging times that makes all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>So let me conclude by saying this:  As the ambassador said, we are celebrating 30 years of diplomatic relations with Moldova last month.  And as I mentioned a moment ago, we have local staff who’ve been serving with us since 1993.  Think about that.  That’s pretty extraordinary.  And let me see if any of them are actually in the room with us today.</p>
<p>Nicolai Jomiru – here, or maybe on the screen?  I’m just going to read off a couple names I really want to acknowledge because of this extraordinary service.  Constantin Mutaf, anywhere with us today?  I’m going to – we’re going to applaud all of them.  Vlad Cojuhari?  Here?  No?  All right.  Eduard Pirlea.  Dorin Trestianu.  All right.  Finally we got one.  (Applause.)  Aurel Veiru.  Yes.  (Applause.)  Please accept those applause on behalf of your other colleagues as well.  (Laughter.)  I’m glad.  I was getting worried.</p>
<p>But seriously, I really can’t thank each of you and each of your other colleagues who’ve been with us so long – I can’t find the words to express how much that means.  We’re so grateful for this partnership, for this service.  It makes all the difference in the world.  And let me just say to everyone here, whether you are local staff or whether you’re family, whether you’re an FSO, a civil servant; whether you’re State, Defense, USAID, Peace Corps, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Chisinau, Moldova</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  We go now to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who’s in Moldova this morning.  Mr. Secretary, good morning to you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good morning, Margaret.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Vladimir Putin has said that sanctions amount to a declaration of war.  They are impacting his economy, but they’re not stopping his military.  When will sanctions stop the fight?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Margaret, the impact of the sanctions is already devastating, which is presumably why he said what he said.  But at the same time, we continue to see President Putin doubling down and digging in on this aggression against Ukraine.  That’s continuing.  I think we have to be prepared, unfortunately, tragically, for this to go on for some time.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>NATO has said none of its 30 members are willing to set up a no-fly zone.  President Biden has been very clear he has no interest in that or combat troops.  But what more can the United States do here?  If, for instance, the Polish Government, a NATO member, wants to send fighter jets, does that get a green light from the U.S., or are you afraid that that will escalate tension?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  No, that gets a green light.  In fact, we’re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians.  What can we do?  How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they’re handing over to the Ukrainians?  We’re in very active discussions with them about that.</p>
<p>Look, I’ve been in Europe for the last couple of days working closely as always with our allies and partners at NATO, the European Union, the G7 countries, and all of us together are continuing to take steps to increase the pressure on Russia through additional sanctions, all of which are very actively under discussion and will be implemented in the coming days, as well as taking further steps to give the Ukrainians what they need to defend themselves against the Russian aggression.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  How do you convince Vladimir Putin that this isn’t ultimately about regime change?  How do you get him to back down?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>For us, it’s not about regime change.  That’s – the Russian people have to decide who they want to lead them.  And look, as I said, the challenge is this: Vladimir Putin continues to press this aggression.  That’s why I say I’m afraid this could go on for some time.  But it’s going to end, and it’s going to end with Ukraine prevailing, because even as Putin has the capacity because he can – the manpower, the equipment that he has that he can bring to bear, can continue to grind down these incredibly brave and resilient Ukrainians, winning a battle is not the same thing as winning a war.  Taking the city is not the same thing as capturing the hearts and minds of Ukrainians.</p>
<p>What they’ve demonstrated with extraordinary courage is that they will not be subjugated to Vladimir Putin’s will to – and be under Russia’s thumb.  So whether that takes another week, another month, another year to play out, it will.  And I know how this is going to end.  But the question is: Can we end it sooner rather than later with less suffering than to – going forward?</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  President Zelenskyy has repeatedly said that these may be his final days.  If Russia kills him, what will be the consequence?  And are you working on a contingency plan to support a Ukrainian government without him at the helm?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The leadership that President Zelenskyy has shown, the entire government has shown, is remarkable.  They’ve been the embodiment of this incredibly brave Ukrainian people.  I was just a day ago in Ukraine, at least about 15 feet into Ukraine with my friend and colleague, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.  The Ukrainians have plans in place that I’m not going to talk about or get into any details on to make sure that there is what we would call continuity of government one way or another.  And let me leave it at that.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I also want to ask you about another massive diplomatic undertaking, and this is the attempt to negotiate a deal to put a cap on Iran’s nuclear program.  Yesterday, Russia’s top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, said he wants you to personally give him a written guarantee of exemptions from sanctions in order to keep cooperation on the nuclear deal.  Are you giving him that?  Is the entire Iran deal at risk?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>The sanctions that are being put in place and that have been put in place on Russia have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal and the prospects of getting back into that agreement.  These things are totally different and are – just are not in any way linked together.  So I think that’s irrelevant.</p>
<p>It’s also in Russia’s interest irrespective of anything else for Iran not to be able to have a nuclear weapon or have the capacity to produce a weapon on very, very short order.  That interest remains, again, irrespective of where we are in our relationship with Russia as a result of its aggression in Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b> What are the prospects for that deal and also two other aspects here – the American hostages that are being held by Iran right now? And do you see the prospect for Iran agreeing to stop threatening people on U.S. soil like they did a journalist living in New York, like they have threatened your predecessor, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We’ve made real progress in recent weeks on getting back to reimplementation of the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, and I think we’re close.  But there are a couple of very challenging remaining issues, and nothing’s done until everything’s done.  And so unless we’re able to resolve a couple of outstanding issues, then we don’t get – we don’t get back to the deal.  But we’re working on it right now.  It is really coming down to whether we can resolve a couple of outstanding issues.  If we can, we’ll get back in the deal.  If we can’t, we won’t.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>On those specific issues of stopping threats against those on U.S. soil and on releasing hostages, are those two demands?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We’re going to continue to do everything we possibly can to get detained Americans, arbitrarily detained Americans, home, whether it’s Iran or anywhere else.  And that’s something we’re working, again, every single day.</p>
<p>When it comes to threats that that Iran is making, when it comes to actions that it’s taken outside of the nuclear area, including activities in the region, in the Middle East, that are threatening to us, threatening to allies and partners – again, irrespective of whether we get back into the deal or not, we will stand and act against those every single day.  We were very clear when we were in the deal originally that nothing about the deal prevents us from taking action against Iran when it’s engaged in actions that threaten us, threaten our allies and partners.  That will very much continue.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b> Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks, Margaret.  Good to be with you.</p>
