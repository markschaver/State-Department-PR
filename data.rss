					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>U.S. Embassy Berlin</p>
<p><strong>MS QUINVILLE:    </strong>Mr. Secretary, here and virtually, you have the community of mighty Mission Germany.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>All right.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS QUINVILLE:  </strong>This is our embassy and five consulates in Hamburg, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, and Leipzig.  We are 1,700 strong.  We are Americans from across our government.  We are Germans and folks from around the world who are resident here in Berlin and elsewhere in Germany.  We are creative, committed, energetic, and flexible.  In a crisis, we bend but never break.</p>
<p>When COVID hit, we knew it was going to define us as a community, so we were generous with each other.  We shifted to a mix of home office and in-office work with remarkable grace.  We accidentally met families and pets during our Zoom meetings, and we forgave each other our worst hair days.  For the 16 months of sometimes-tough-to-take lockdown, we have stood six feet apart and still supported each other.  And you will not find a better team to power our policy.  So I am proud to be part of this extraordinary group.</p>
<p>Now, for mighty Mission Germany, please welcome Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you all so very, very much.  Robin, I think you&#8217;ve summed it up better than I could.  I&#8217;ve heard about mighty Mission Germany.  Now I get to see mighty Mission Germany here on the screen, and to hear it also in your words.  I am so grateful to have everyone or have so many of you together in this room, to get to meet face to face or maybe mask to mask, depending.</p>
<p>And I just can&#8217;t begin to tell you how proud I am of the work that you&#8217;ve been doing, the way that you&#8217;ve been doing it in a time of tremendous, tremendous challenge.  And to your point, Robin, I think what we&#8217;ve seen here – and I&#8217;ve got to tell you, what we&#8217;ve seen in our missions around the world that I&#8217;ve had the privilege in these past couple of months to visit – we have seen exactly what you described, which is our teams, our people coming together, and six feet apart but standing together, continuing the work that you’re entrusted with.  And I am truly grateful for that.</p>
<p>There are few more important places to be doing that then right here in Germany.  I said yesterday that it&#8217;s hard to think of a better friend or a stronger partner to the United States.  And we need those strong partners and those good friends.  Everything that we&#8217;re doing on behalf of our fellow citizens back home, the challenges that they face, the things that are going to have a real impact on their lives, we can&#8217;t do it alone, certainly not as effectively.</p>
<p>And whether it&#8217;s the big issues of our time like dealing with this pandemic, climate change, disruptive impact of technology, to smaller day-in/day-out things, we know that even the United States can&#8217;t get the job done alone, that we benefit profoundly from working in coordination and cooperation with others.  And to me, it&#8217;s a tremendous sense of strength and comfort to know that we have such a strong, committed partner in Germany.  And that partnership, the day-in/day-out work of making it strong, building it, keeping it resilient – that&#8217;s exactly what all of you, each and every one of you, is doing every single day.  And I couldn&#8217;t be more grateful for that.</p>
<p>We had a short but very, very good visit here in these last 24-plus hours, including a very, very productive meeting with Chancellor Merkel that I&#8217;m grateful for, a lot of time with my friend and a wonderful person, Heiko Maas, the foreign minister.  You all saw that we took part of the important conference that Germany brought together on Libya and its future.  And just now, just across the street, we launched the U.S.-Germany Dialogue on Holocaust Issues.  That, in just a small way, captures the incredible breadth as well as the depth of what we&#8217;re doing together.</p>
<p>Robin, I know you are heading back home in just a few days, and I just want to salute your remarkable leadership these last 16 months at this mission.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  With your very dynamic DCM, I think you&#8217;ve demonstrated what an incredibly powerful duo can do and get done with the remarkable team here at Mission Germany.</p>
<p>I do want to spend one more second just on the resilience that all of you showed during COVID. We are getting to the end of it.  I know we’ve had – continue to have ups and downs, but we&#8217;re getting there.  But I have some feeling and understanding for what these months of lockdowns and being closed in and quarantined and other restrictions have meant.  And again, I just want to say thank you for doing, in so many different ways, big and small, what it took to keep morale high, to keep the mission going, to keep working on behalf of the American people, to take care of Americans here in Germany, just to keep the work of this mission going.</p>
<p>I heard about a couple of things that just struck me.  And, again, we&#8217;re – when we&#8217;re doing a lot of this work we sometimes are talking in terms of big high-policy issues and strategic matters of one kind or another.  But the human things have such a powerful impact too.  So the mass community outreach initiative that I heard about handmade more than a thousand cloth masks donated to hospitals, to eldercare facilities, to refugee camps, to the Ronald McDonald House.  I can&#8217;t begin to tell you how even that kind of gesture has a lasting, profound impact on people.  That&#8217;s the human connection that you&#8217;re also making every single day.</p>
<p>Now, maybe on a more challenging note, I know that you&#8217;ve waited just a little bit for the completion of the annex renovations.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>MS QUINVILLE:  </strong>Yeah.  Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>I know I’m treading on dangerous territory, but this is a major endeavor.  I think it’s demanded two things: patience and you mentioned flexibility – well, there’s another example of it, but I think well worth the wait.  New fitness facilities, basketball court, a satellite health office, beautiful community spaces – I hope, indeed, well worth the wait.</p>
<p>Let me close with this:  Whether you are a direct hire, Foreign Service Officer, civil servant; whether you&#8217;re working with one of our many partner agencies, departments; whether you&#8217;re a family member; whether you&#8217;re locally employed staff – we count on each and every one of you to keep this relationship strong, to keep it vital, to keep it going, to do the work that is so important to our fellow citizens.  And let me just say to the locally employed staff, very simply, thank you. You are the lifeblood of this mission.  You&#8217;re the lifeblood of missions everywhere around the world.  The real connectivity between our communities, you&#8217;re bringing that every single day.  I know that a number of you are here in this room.  I&#8217;m grateful to you on behalf of the United States.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve – we&#8217;re getting to the – I think the end of a challenging period.  We have lots of other challenges that we have to grapple with every single day.  When I get a chance to see each and every one of you, it gives me incredible hope.  It gives me incredible confidence, conviction that we&#8217;re going to meet the tests and challenges of our time.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> We wanted to do this just on background attributable to senior State Department officials to give you a sense of some of the discussions today, and we thought we would start with the Libya discussion. And  can offer a sense of how things went, the progress that was made, and what remains. So again, we’ll just do this on background.</p>
<p>And with that, I see  joining us. He will be another senior State Department official and he can obviously &#8212;</p>
<p>(Chit-chat.)</p>
<p>So let’s start with this – let’s start with this senior State Department official to talk about Libya and we’ll go from there.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Okay, hey. I think there are three things that we’re headlining out of this conference today. One is the – it’s the first appearance by a sovereign Libyan more or less united – interim united government in a long, long time, and they made their appearance on the international stage. They articulated their case, pushed for various things, and that’s already a huge step forward from where we were two years ago. So the Berlin process, which started with this summit in January of 2020, has now taken the next step with the participation of a sovereign interim Libyan Government.</p>
<p>The second headline is that – has to do with the elections. I mean, precisely, this is an interim government. Its mission is to establish – pave the way for elections on December 24th of 2021 and to deliver essential services in the meanwhile. Last summer, there were 20 hours a day of blackouts in Tripoli. There were lines at the gas stations, there were lines at the banks. This government’s primary mandate is – some people call it electricity and elections or elections and electricity, the two Es. And, of course, COVID is an issue in Libya too and they’re struggling to get on top of that.</p>
<p>So what we needed to do and what I think was achieved by this gathering was to send the signal and to hear the Libyan prime minister fully commit himself to December elections. Some people have raised doubts about his degree of commitment. There’s the perennial perception that people in power try to stay indefinitely, and in this case, we’re getting good assurances from him that that’s not the case. He plans to respect the process, the so-called LPDF – Libyan Political Dialogue Forum – process that established this date of December 24th.</p>
<p>The elections are really important for a number of reasons, not just to legitimize a long-term, credible Libyan government, but they relate to the third headline for us, which has to do with foreign forces, mercenaries, and fighters. A fully empowered, legitimate Libyan government will be in a much stronger position to turn to some of these foreign actors and say, “Thank you very much, it’s our country now and we’d like to be the ones to define the security cooperation relationships that we’re going to have and not have them imposed on us.” And so we did not get to a complete agreement on this. The Turks did a footnote on the language that relates to foreign forces because the Turks believe their trainers are there with a – by virtue of a legitimate agreement with the – of a viable agreement with a legitimate Libyan government, the previous Government of National Accord. So they don’t like being equated with foreign fighters and mercenaries, and the German foreign minister, I noticed at their press conference, made that point publicly.</p>
<p>But these are contentious issues with some of the other participants. The Egyptians believe that the Turks are just trying to use their influence to embed themselves permanently in Libya with a military presence with an ideological flavor, and so the Egyptians and the French have concerns about that. And there were serious attempts and I think good-faith attempts and useful attempts, because it showed everybody that and it showed the Libyans that there is a strong will to try to bridge the gap here. But they didn’t quite close the deal with the Turks.</p>
<p>The Libyans – again, to have them there as a sovereign government making their own case for themselves was a really instructive moment, because it was quite clear to a number of participants in the group that the Egyptians and the Turks were putting it pretty hard to the Libyans. And that’s not a good look.</p>
<p>So again, the – and then the other important thing on the foreign forces issue is that in addition to whatever might happen in this particular gathering, there have been some discussions underway for a while on how to make progress on the low-hanging fruit, the foreign fighters and mercenaries. You have a ceasefire that’s holding. Most of the foreign parties – I would say all of the foreign parties – realize that trying to achieve their goals by military means isn’t going to work. Those who backed Haftar, it failed. So they’re pretty much all committed now to a political process.</p>
<p>The – sorry, I lost my train of thought. But so the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Yeah, the low-hanging fruit. Thank you. The – everybody understands that getting the Turks and Wagner out is really hard, but to preserve the ceasefire and to build on it, you want to make some progress somewhere. And there is a recognition even by some of these outside parties that if you could do some confidence-building measures that don’t undermine the status quo militarily, that don’t expose one side to an attack, let’s try that.</p>
<p>And so we have – the French have put some pen to paper on this. We’ve – even before that we’re talking to the Turks, and we’re basically in a position where both the Turks and the Russians have agreed that this could be a topic of discussion, that let’s talk about whether you could get 300 Syrians on side and 300 Syrians from the other side, put them on a plane, and get them somewhere just as a tangible, practical first step. These processes always work step by step, and the problem with the differences and the inability to agree on language in the end was because, of course, people were trying to be very ambitious. And yes, the UN Security Council resolutions call for the immediate departure of all foreign forces and fighters and the Libyan ceasefire of October 2020 calls for the departure of all foreign – in 90 days. But it hasn’t happened.</p>
<p>So our approach, the typically American, pragmatic approach, is let’s go for the low-hanging fruit. And we think that we have some basis for moving forward on sort of a bilateral and under the aegis of these other activities and the forum here today was useful to pursue this, but it’s not something that was specifically agreed to at the Berlin conference.</p>
<p>So on those three issues – Libyan sovereignty, elections, foreign fighters – we thought – we found this a useful exercise. Got to congratulate the Germans for the role they’ve played. The previous UN secretary – special representative of the secretary-general, Ghassan Salame, I met him shortly after I started this job. He had just come from Berlin, so this would have been about August of 2019. He had met with Merkel and he had persuaded her that this could be a good thing for the Germans to do. It would be a nice legacy for her. It would – Germany is seen as not as terribly self-interested in Libya as, say, the French or the Italians, and they could play this role. And they’ve done it very well. But they can’t deliver 100 percent agreement. Nobody can right now.</p>
<p>So this was – they did a great job of staging a very good conference. And the last thing I’ll just say is the fact that Secretary Blinken showed up was considered as a very big deal. That’s one thing that brought a number of foreign ministers here. You had the Turk, the Egyptian, the French, the – you had pretty good representation here – the Algerian. And having – there’s something about the Libyan process where the Americans are seen as having kind of, again, a less self-interested perspective than some of the other countries and that our influence can still be put to good use and to have the administration engage at this level was really significant. And since this administration took office, one – they’ve tried to send the signal that – taking Libya a little more seriously. They – people got the message.</p>
<p>Joey Hood, the acting assistant secretary, came out and with – thanks to him coming out at that level, we got the airplane we needed to be able to go into Tripoli. So the first – May 18th, the first visit by the most senior official by an American official – most senior visit by an American official to Tripoli since 2014, and the first time an American ambassador had been there for a couple of years. And then now to have the Secretary come here, there was a sense that the United States is taking this issue seriously, lending its diplomatic influence. We’re not necessarily leading the process; we’re supporting the UN in its work.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that the UN special envoy was not able to attend. I want to respect his privacy, but let’s just say there’s a virus going around, and so he couldn’t come. But he had a representative here and he was watching it on – he’s monitoring it. So he’ll be able to pick up where this left off through some – several things that are going to happen over the coming days to especially drive the election process. And then again on a bilateral basis, we’re going to pursue some of these foreign force issues.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Sure, we can – yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Can I just clarify one thing? So you – there was not a complete agreement in the conference on the withdrawal of foreign forces, largely because of Turkey?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> I’m just going to say there was – because the participants were not able to agree.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> The Turks did a pretty good job of trying to then, in turn, isolate the Egyptians, who couldn’t agree on a different variation. So there are strong feelings – on one side the Turks, on the other side the Egyptians, to some extent the French. Each has a valid position in their own way. The frustrating part about it is that the Libyans were there saying, “Hey, what are we, chopped liver here?” And so their position was we can live with any one of these variations because it’s ultimately aimed at starting a practical process that will result in the departure of foreign forces.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right. But do you &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> If I could – if I could just follow on ’s comment. To underscore an answer to what you just asked – what  said earlier – what we did get, what the participants did agree upon, is something new, which is that foreign fighters &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, I was just going to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> &#8212; need to leave, and that needs to begin now, and that’s something to which all the parties present agreed. On the issue of foreign forces, 2570 sets out that goal. It’s all foreign forces. That’s an aspirational goal. There’s a process here, and saying, “All means all and they all leave tonight – why haven’t they left tonight? Will they leave tomorrow night?” is not, frankly, a realistic approach in a real-world situation such as Libya. Getting at what we think is one of the key destabilizing elements, the presence of those foreign fighters – Syrians, Chadians, Sudanese – that is an important first step and it’s not something we had before.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> Now it has to be made operational.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right. And you also said Turks and Russians have agreed to simultaneously pull out foreign mercenaries, so that was one thing that they &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Fighters.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Fighters.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> I would say fighters.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> We talked specifically – and I would say this is initial agreement to be pursued, but we have interest and agreement in principle to discuss departure of, let’s say, a cohort of Syrian fighters on each side.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Who was here from the Russians?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> The Russian deputy foreign minister, Vershinin.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> Sergey Vershinin.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Sergey Vershinin.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Could I just ask for some more detail on that? You were mentioning the hundreds of foreign fighters coming out and the foreign minister of Libya herself was saying in the coming days. Is that a set process that’s actually something that’s – is that more aspirational that this could just happen in the next few days or is there actually setting something – process set in motion for that to happen?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> This – it’s not a concrete process yet. The – again, the value of Berlin was actually the first real opportunity we’ve had to start to talk how to flesh this out. I believe, and I’m not in a position to confirm, but it’s my understanding that this subject was broached at the Geneva – at the Geneva summit recently. And so there is still work to be done with the Russians on this and the Turks. There’s deep suspicion, of course. But there’s also a realization that there could be some value to them in trying to show something on this. So what we want to do is explore that, and I don’t have a format for you yet on how we would do that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Haven’t the Turks already withdrawn some Syrians or said they’ve withdrawn (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> There was a story a couple of – even more than a couple of months ago that some cohort of Syrians had left.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> We were actually never able to confirm that, and if it did happen it was the only one.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> And this is a really complicated issue because the – who was it? The Emiratis told us that the Tunisian foreign minister had called them and said a lot of these Syrians are actually Tunisians, and the Tunisians don’t want them repatriated to Tunis. They don’t want a bunch of radical foreign fighters on their territory. So it’s not – even if you’ve got agreement to get them out, there are issues about where they would go, who would take them, how do you – it has to be verifiable. There is a mechanism through the UN monitoring presence; there’s a modest UN monitoring presence that’s being set up to monitor the Libyan ceasefire, 60 people or something. And then you have this 5+5 joint military commission of Libyan officers from each – from the west and the east. These are the mechanisms that would be used for verification. So we have a concept on that, but this is still at the initial stages.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> But let’s not be confused: We know who the Syrians are. They are either pro-regime Syrians brought in by Wagner Group or Haftar, or they’re Syrian National Army fighters brought in from northwest Syria by the Turks. There’s no great mystery &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And the Turks are paying them, right?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> &#8212; as to where they are – the issues of payment is a bit obscure and not something I would be confident in commenting on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I understand there’s no concrete process yet, but has the U.S. expressed any openness to providing material support to getting these foreign fighters out if that were to be something that’s needed?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>We’ve talked about lending diplomatic support to the process, and until we really have a better idea of what the process is, I don’t think we’re in a position to talk about &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any numbers at all on either side?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> I mean, people talk – they throw out the number 300 on each side.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Total? 300 fighters?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> To start with on – as an initial tranche.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, but what would the total be?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> To bring out.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>There are thousands.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> She’s asking the total number of &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Oh, how many are there?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible.) There are thousands.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong> Oh, there’s – there are 6,000 Syrians at least.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On both sides combined, you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> No. I think just on the Turkish side there’s 6,000 Syrians. Is that right, , or &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>Yeah. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And that 300 is both sides, Turkish and Russian side?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Do you have 300 from each side &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> This is all sort of notional still here. I don’t want to send the message that the process has been launched.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>But the idea, if it’s ever launched &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> &#8212; Chadians, Sudanese, Janjaweed, Syrians, eventually they all go. There’s got to be a tranche process.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> If there are thousands on the Turkish side, how many are there on the other side?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>Thousands.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thousands?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What does the United States think about Ankara’s position that they are invited?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> The Turks assert, as they did today, that the memorandum of understanding they’ve reached with the Serraj government some years ago continues to apply.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> We don’t dispute that, but we are focused on how to get beyond that.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> And I would simply note I think there is a growing recognition, which is a healthy one, that in a circumstance which we all hope is realized in the course of the coming months where there is a new government that emerges from the elections on December 24th (inaudible) a unified military structure. There is going to have to be a new arrangement for whatever form, if there is one, of train, advise, assist forces are there to help the new unified Libyan Armed Forces. That doesn’t take us to that happy goal tomorrow, and I can’t tell you at, what, 3:00 p.m. plus five it will happen. But that’s certainly the objective, and I think there’s a recognition that things change when there is a government post-election, when there is a unified Libyan military. And referencing to now four-year-old MOUs with a government which would then be twice removed is not going to carry you all that far.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Who picked December 24 for the election?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> The – it was one of the Libyan – or some of the Libyan participants in this LPDF.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I mean, I recognize that – I mean, it’s just like – seems designed for people not to be paying attention to it in most of the countries who are represented here today.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Grinch.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I recognize that – the Grinch? Okay. Yeah, I think that’s (inaudible) &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> No. And let’s give &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; going to get. But, I mean, why have an election on a day when no one in this group, most people who are attending the conference, are really going to be having their eye on the ball?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> This was not done with any view to the Western calendar. This was done &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, clearly. And I think that says my entire point.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> And the Libyans would say: So what? We’re not here to please the West. We’re trying to salvage our country.</p>
<p>And what people didn’t want, I think, was to have this drag into next year and have it keep being put off. But they pushed it off obviously as late as they could this year. I don’t know where the 24th comes in in terms of the Muslim calendar in December, but we have to – we should give credit to Stephanie Williams and the LPDF process, because basically that process took 74 people and had them make decisions about the future of Libya politically that have so far managed to stick, and that’s quite an achievement. And now the challenge is to keep it going.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I don’t – I mean, it’s fine for the Libyans to have – they can have – anyone can have their election on any day they want to. But in the – in a situation like this where you have conferences – this is the second one, right – where there are a ton of Western countries involved and any number of things can go wrong, are you going to tell me that any of the countries who are interested, with some few exceptions, are really going to be in a position on Christmas Eve to – or Christmas or over that week to actually do anything about it besides (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Well, I think we’re going to know before December 24th whether this is going to fall into place. There are going to have to be – we’ll see if there’s some patriotic election monitors and observers who want to go out around that time of year. But, I mean, nobody – you’re the first person who’s ever raised that question with me.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just ask you – you mentioned the commitment to the election. Was that conditional in any way, saying that we need some more support from the outside world? Where do you think the countries are in terms of the (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>I wouldn’t say it was conditional in the way he put it, but I – they will in the same breath say there are definitely going to be obstacles here – security, logistical, financial. But I think they accept our point that, yes, there are obstacles but none of them is insurmountable. And the – there is always a temptation when you’re in power to think you need to stay a little bit longer, and I think the prime minister is understanding that he wants to resist that temptation in the interests of the country.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On the – you said that the process is not a concrete one. So what is next? What is going to make it more concrete? What should we expect, or should we just wait for some withdrawals to (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>I would – let’s just say I’m not in a position to give you any detail on that, so I don’t want to speculate.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How would you describe America’s national interest in the outcome here?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Libya had the potential and potential – could still have the potential to be another ungoverned space where terrorists can operate with impunity. ISIS was quite well-installed in Libya, had to be beaten back. In the last month, there have been two small attacks, again, in Libya that were claimed by ISIS. And so it’s a reminder that the terrorist issue has not gone away, and I think for us that’s a primary interest.</p>
<p>The Russian involvement in Libya has turned this now into something that has geopolitical implications for the United States, and it’s on NATO’s southern flank that the Russians have embedded. They are projecting influence into sub-Saharan Africa. Wagner is – we don’t accept that this is a private company; it’s an armed Russian state, and they’re carrying out Russia’s strategic objectives in sub-Saharan Africa and in the southern Med.</p>
<p>Libya is a huge supplier of oil and gas; that’s not the driving interest that it might have been at one time, but it’s still a factor in global economic affairs.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And migration also?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> The migration issue.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>The migration issue is – it’s sort of not directly related to us, but to the extent it’s a tool to destabilize allies and partners in Europe, of course it’s an issue. And it’s a humanitarian issue. More Libyans are going to drown every day now because there’s a lot of migrants in Libya who at one point might have been happy to be there and do menial labor or have a job or whatever, but now because of the instability and the fighting and the fact the country hasn’t recovered yet, they’re not sticking around. And so from just a humanitarian perspective and a political perspective of the Europeans, you want to try to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> I know  has to take off shortly, so , is there anything you want to say just on the bilateral piece?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> Yeah, let me just say I think you’ve heard really a good summary of the topics and the tone when the two foreign – Foreign Minister Maas and the Secretary gave their on-the-record press conference, so I don’t think there’s a lot I can add there. The foreign minister thanked the Secretary for coming back to Europe, returning to Europe this week, underscored the Germany guiding principle of foreign policy of course is multilateralism, and thanked the United States for re-engagement, revitalization of so many multilateral fora. The fact that this is a week after President Biden came to Europe and participated in that series of summits that you’re very familiar with, he came first to Europe. A combined bilateral and multilateral diplomacy engagement was important.</p>
<p>Both of them talked (inaudible) about how there’s a focus on strengthening our own countries, and of course that’s why strong bilateral relations and multilateral relations are good, delivering results efficiently, productively, effectively for our own citizens is something we can do together, and I think they highlighted the fact that the competitive advantage that we have, and you can see this with the President’s progression from the G7 to the NATO summit to the U.S.-EU summit, is indeed the set of partnerships and alliances that we have where the partners and allies themselves choose to come together and support each other through these structures we’ve created. And the Secretary highlighted a response to the thanks that the minister gave for him coming here; in fact, wanted to recognize German leadership on issues like Libya and what my unnamed colleague here has just described. And the Secretary gave the foreign minister a fuller readout of the President Biden meeting with President Putin, just a chance to go into more details there, and promised, of course, to keep in close consultation on those set of issues. Safe to underscore we are very clear-eyed and sober in terms of relations with Russia.</p>
<p>Of course, the foreign minister highlighted the German elections, which are very much on people’s minds here. As we’ve seen in other fora, Russian efforts to influence German elections of course are something they keep a close eye on. They also were able to talk about Turkey, including a readout with a little more detail of the President’s meeting with President Erdogan, and focus on Afghanistan, and the work on maintaining a strong diplomatic mission there as the troops draw down, including international zone security and other issues. They touched on Belarus and highlighted the strong unity that’s remained between the U.S., the EU, and of course the UK, and Canada as well in terms of coordinating our sanctions and our response, and looking at ways to respond to things like the Ryanair incident and the other sort of outrageous crackdown that Lukashenko has perpetrated against people there who were just speaking out for fundamental rights and for a government that delivers for them.</p>
<p>They did talk about Syria and the humanitarian access issue that is important, of course, for – with the UN. Also touched on Iraq, and talked about the critical elections coming up there, our joint support for UNAMI and election monitoring, since you bring up elections. And did talk about Ukraine, of course; reviewed the Normandy format and the fact that there is a dynamic still there, albeit a tough one. And then, of course, as you guys asked and the Secretary described, they did discuss Nord Stream 2 and – in the context of this extremely broad and collegial, familial relationship where we’re able to pursue so much with the Germans, we do have a big difference on that particular issue. Both sides have acknowledged that. And we need to find a way to get to some significant steps in terms of the – mitigating the threats as the Secretary said on the record. And I think the minister acknowledged that and the fact that they were tackling this &#8212; well, and I won’t go into more of the details there, but that diplomacy continues, but I think, again, underscores what they both said: The broad relationship and its robust set of issues on which we’re working together is really quite, quite strong. And that allows us then to have an area where we disagree quite strongly, as the foreign minister acknowledged; he’s heard the Secretary and the U.S. position on this, and they’ll keep working on it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can you – , can I ask you about – there was a report today that the French and German have agreed together to invite President Putin to come and visit, and I wondered if that – this was brought in the EU, much to the dismay of the Baltic states. It was a big story in the FT this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> Sorry, I missed that. It did not come up in their meeting.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But I wonder if that was something that was discussed at all in the President’s meetings last week or discussed &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE: </strong>That, I wouldn’t be able to help you on. We’ve gotten no readouts.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Anything on it? Is this, like, totally news to you?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> To me, I’m not following Putin’s travels or this FT story. But &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, the story was about Macron and Merkel, that they agreed to do this, and they told the EU today that they want to do it.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> I’d just &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> &#8212; talk to them. I know in the Normandy format, they’re looking at a foreign ministers meeting &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, no, this was &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> &#8212; which is a step they’ve been talking about for some time.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So – just to be clear, then, so the chancellor didn’t pose the idea of having Russia come to some future EU meeting in the meeting with the Secretary today?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> I really don’t know what the chancellor has said. I was not in the meeting with the chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Got it.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> But in the meeting with Foreign Minister Maas, there was not a discussion, but they did discuss at the EU foreign ministers meeting yesterday, talked about having – for instance, the Iraqi foreign minister was there and they went through the kind of issues, they talked there. But that piece didn’t come up in the bilat meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister Maas.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, then let me just get in a Nord Stream 2 question. So, I mean, he was asked by one of the German reporters, I think, that – could there be an agreement on how you mitigate the Russian threat by the time that Merkel visits Washington, and he said, well, that’ll be great if it could happen, but – I know you don’t want to get into it, but how advanced are these discussions? Is there any common ground here on how they can actually do it? And the white paper that – or the non-paper – sorry – Jake gave to the German delegation before the President came here with U.S. suggestions, how &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, he – so after the decision on the – you know this, . Let’s – don’t play dumb.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> We’re going down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Laughter) Where we were back in Iceland and the sanctions announcement came out with the waivers, right, the Germans sent the team to Washington.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. And they reiterated their proposal from, like, two years ago about how they were going to try to allay your concerns. I won’t go into those details, but you know them well. Anyway, in response, Jake or someone at the NSC presented them with a response. And they came back here, they had been discussing this. I want to know where that stands, and if you think that there is any possibility that by the time that Merkel visits Washington there could be some kind of a resolution to this.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> I would agree violently with the Secretary that that would be a good thing and that we’re both – both sides are working hard on this. But it’s the kind of diplomacy and discussion and engagement. Today is another useful step there, and again, I wasn’t in the meeting with the chancellor, so to just keep at it. (Inaudible) And obviously, everybody’s aware of the various timelines, and certainly we all want to see the chancellor’s visit in Washington to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> One more data point on Sunday. The Secretary will have an opportunity to meet with the Israeli foreign minister in Rome. We will have a bilateral engagement with Foreign Minister Lapid on Sunday. We’ll have more details on the timing of that as it comes together, but wanted to pass that along as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> We wanted to do this just on background attributable to senior State Department officials to give you a sense of some of the discussions today, and we thought we would start with the Libya discussion. And  can offer a sense of how things went, the progress that was made, and what remains. So again, we’ll just do this on background.</p>
<p>And with that, I see  joining us. He will be another senior State Department official and he can obviously &#8212;</p>
<p>(Chit-chat.)</p>
<p>So let’s start with this – let’s start with this senior State Department official to talk about Libya and we’ll go from there.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Okay, hey. I think there are three things that we’re headlining out of this conference today. One is the – it’s the first appearance by a sovereign Libyan more or less united – interim united government in a long, long time, and they made their appearance on the international stage. They articulated their case, pushed for various things, and that’s already a huge step forward from where we were two years ago. So the Berlin process, which started with this summit in January of 2020, has now taken the next step with the participation of a sovereign interim Libyan Government.</p>
<p>The second headline is that – has to do with the elections. I mean, precisely, this is an interim government. Its mission is to establish – pave the way for elections on December 24th of 2021 and to deliver essential services in the meanwhile. Last summer, there were 20 hours a day of blackouts in Tripoli. There were lines at the gas stations, there were lines at the banks. This government’s primary mandate is – some people call it electricity and elections or elections and electricity, the two Es. And, of course, COVID is an issue in Libya too and they’re struggling to get on top of that.</p>
<p>So what we needed to do and what I think was achieved by this gathering was to send the signal and to hear the Libyan prime minister fully commit himself to December elections. Some people have raised doubts about his degree of commitment. There’s the perennial perception that people in power try to stay indefinitely, and in this case, we’re getting good assurances from him that that’s not the case. He plans to respect the process, the so-called LPDF – Libyan Political Dialogue Forum – process that established this date of December 24th.</p>
<p>The elections are really important for a number of reasons, not just to legitimize a long-term, credible Libyan government, but they relate to the third headline for us, which has to do with foreign forces, mercenaries, and fighters. A fully empowered, legitimate Libyan government will be in a much stronger position to turn to some of these foreign actors and say, “Thank you very much, it’s our country now and we’d like to be the ones to define the security cooperation relationships that we’re going to have and not have them imposed on us.” And so we did not get to a complete agreement on this. The Turks did a footnote on the language that relates to foreign forces because the Turks believe their trainers are there with a – by virtue of a legitimate agreement with the – of a viable agreement with a legitimate Libyan government, the previous Government of National Accord. So they don’t like being equated with foreign fighters and mercenaries, and the German foreign minister, I noticed at their press conference, made that point publicly.</p>
<p>But these are contentious issues with some of the other participants. The Egyptians believe that the Turks are just trying to use their influence to embed themselves permanently in Libya with a military presence with an ideological flavor, and so the Egyptians and the French have concerns about that. And there were serious attempts and I think good-faith attempts and useful attempts, because it showed everybody that and it showed the Libyans that there is a strong will to try to bridge the gap here. But they didn’t quite close the deal with the Turks.</p>
<p>The Libyans – again, to have them there as a sovereign government making their own case for themselves was a really instructive moment, because it was quite clear to a number of participants in the group that the Egyptians and the Turks were putting it pretty hard to the Libyans. And that’s not a good look.</p>
<p>So again, the – and then the other important thing on the foreign forces issue is that in addition to whatever might happen in this particular gathering, there have been some discussions underway for a while on how to make progress on the low-hanging fruit, the foreign fighters and mercenaries. You have a ceasefire that’s holding. Most of the foreign parties – I would say all of the foreign parties – realize that trying to achieve their goals by military means isn’t going to work. Those who backed Haftar, it failed. So they’re pretty much all committed now to a political process.</p>
<p>The – sorry, I lost my train of thought. But so the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Yeah, the low-hanging fruit. Thank you. The – everybody understands that getting the Turks and Wagner out is really hard, but to preserve the ceasefire and to build on it, you want to make some progress somewhere. And there is a recognition even by some of these outside parties that if you could do some confidence-building measures that don’t undermine the status quo militarily, that don’t expose one side to an attack, let’s try that.</p>
<p>And so we have – the French have put some pen to paper on this. We’ve – even before that we’re talking to the Turks, and we’re basically in a position where both the Turks and the Russians have agreed that this could be a topic of discussion, that let’s talk about whether you could get 300 Syrians on side and 300 Syrians from the other side, put them on a plane, and get them somewhere just as a tangible, practical first step. These processes always work step by step, and the problem with the differences and the inability to agree on language in the end was because, of course, people were trying to be very ambitious. And yes, the UN Security Council resolutions call for the immediate departure of all foreign forces and fighters and the Libyan ceasefire of October 2020 calls for the departure of all foreign – in 90 days. But it hasn’t happened.</p>
<p>So our approach, the typically American, pragmatic approach, is let’s go for the low-hanging fruit. And we think that we have some basis for moving forward on sort of a bilateral and under the aegis of these other activities and the forum here today was useful to pursue this, but it’s not something that was specifically agreed to at the Berlin conference.</p>
<p>So on those three issues – Libyan sovereignty, elections, foreign fighters – we thought – we found this a useful exercise. Got to congratulate the Germans for the role they’ve played. The previous UN secretary – special representative of the secretary-general, Ghassan Salame, I met him shortly after I started this job. He had just come from Berlin, so this would have been about August of 2019. He had met with Merkel and he had persuaded her that this could be a good thing for the Germans to do. It would be a nice legacy for her. It would – Germany is seen as not as terribly self-interested in Libya as, say, the French or the Italians, and they could play this role. And they’ve done it very well. But they can’t deliver 100 percent agreement. Nobody can right now.</p>
<p>So this was – they did a great job of staging a very good conference. And the last thing I’ll just say is the fact that Secretary Blinken showed up was considered as a very big deal. That’s one thing that brought a number of foreign ministers here. You had the Turk, the Egyptian, the French, the – you had pretty good representation here – the Algerian. And having – there’s something about the Libyan process where the Americans are seen as having kind of, again, a less self-interested perspective than some of the other countries and that our influence can still be put to good use and to have the administration engage at this level was really significant. And since this administration took office, one – they’ve tried to send the signal that – taking Libya a little more seriously. They – people got the message.</p>
<p>Joey Hood, the acting assistant secretary, came out and with – thanks to him coming out at that level, we got the airplane we needed to be able to go into Tripoli. So the first – May 18th, the first visit by the most senior official by an American official – most senior visit by an American official to Tripoli since 2014, and the first time an American ambassador had been there for a couple of years. And then now to have the Secretary come here, there was a sense that the United States is taking this issue seriously, lending its diplomatic influence. We’re not necessarily leading the process; we’re supporting the UN in its work.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that the UN special envoy was not able to attend. I want to respect his privacy, but let’s just say there’s a virus going around, and so he couldn’t come. But he had a representative here and he was watching it on – he’s monitoring it. So he’ll be able to pick up where this left off through some – several things that are going to happen over the coming days to especially drive the election process. And then again on a bilateral basis, we’re going to pursue some of these foreign force issues.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Sure, we can – yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Can I just clarify one thing? So you – there was not a complete agreement in the conference on the withdrawal of foreign forces, largely because of Turkey?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> I’m just going to say there was – because the participants were not able to agree.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> The Turks did a pretty good job of trying to then, in turn, isolate the Egyptians, who couldn’t agree on a different variation. So there are strong feelings – on one side the Turks, on the other side the Egyptians, to some extent the French. Each has a valid position in their own way. The frustrating part about it is that the Libyans were there saying, “Hey, what are we, chopped liver here?” And so their position was we can live with any one of these variations because it’s ultimately aimed at starting a practical process that will result in the departure of foreign forces.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right. But do you &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> If I could – if I could just follow on ’s comment. To underscore an answer to what you just asked – what  said earlier – what we did get, what the participants did agree upon, is something new, which is that foreign fighters &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, I was just going to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> &#8212; need to leave, and that needs to begin now, and that’s something to which all the parties present agreed. On the issue of foreign forces, 2570 sets out that goal. It’s all foreign forces. That’s an aspirational goal. There’s a process here, and saying, “All means all and they all leave tonight – why haven’t they left tonight? Will they leave tomorrow night?” is not, frankly, a realistic approach in a real-world situation such as Libya. Getting at what we think is one of the key destabilizing elements, the presence of those foreign fighters – Syrians, Chadians, Sudanese – that is an important first step and it’s not something we had before.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> Now it has to be made operational.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right. And you also said Turks and Russians have agreed to simultaneously pull out foreign mercenaries, so that was one thing that they &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Fighters.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Fighters.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> I would say fighters.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> We talked specifically – and I would say this is initial agreement to be pursued, but we have interest and agreement in principle to discuss departure of, let’s say, a cohort of Syrian fighters on each side.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Who was here from the Russians?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> The Russian deputy foreign minister, Vershinin.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> Sergey Vershinin.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Sergey Vershinin.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Could I just ask for some more detail on that? You were mentioning the hundreds of foreign fighters coming out and the foreign minister of Libya herself was saying in the coming days. Is that a set process that’s actually something that’s – is that more aspirational that this could just happen in the next few days or is there actually setting something – process set in motion for that to happen?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> This – it’s not a concrete process yet. The – again, the value of Berlin was actually the first real opportunity we’ve had to start to talk how to flesh this out. I believe, and I’m not in a position to confirm, but it’s my understanding that this subject was broached at the Geneva – at the Geneva summit recently. And so there is still work to be done with the Russians on this and the Turks. There’s deep suspicion, of course. But there’s also a realization that there could be some value to them in trying to show something on this. So what we want to do is explore that, and I don’t have a format for you yet on how we would do that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Haven’t the Turks already withdrawn some Syrians or said they’ve withdrawn (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> There was a story a couple of – even more than a couple of months ago that some cohort of Syrians had left.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> We were actually never able to confirm that, and if it did happen it was the only one.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> And this is a really complicated issue because the – who was it? The Emiratis told us that the Tunisian foreign minister had called them and said a lot of these Syrians are actually Tunisians, and the Tunisians don’t want them repatriated to Tunis. They don’t want a bunch of radical foreign fighters on their territory. So it’s not – even if you’ve got agreement to get them out, there are issues about where they would go, who would take them, how do you – it has to be verifiable. There is a mechanism through the UN monitoring presence; there’s a modest UN monitoring presence that’s being set up to monitor the Libyan ceasefire, 60 people or something. And then you have this 5+5 joint military commission of Libyan officers from each – from the west and the east. These are the mechanisms that would be used for verification. So we have a concept on that, but this is still at the initial stages.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> But let’s not be confused: We know who the Syrians are. They are either pro-regime Syrians brought in by Wagner Group or Haftar, or they’re Syrian National Army fighters brought in from northwest Syria by the Turks. There’s no great mystery &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And the Turks are paying them, right?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> &#8212; as to where they are – the issues of payment is a bit obscure and not something I would be confident in commenting on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I understand there’s no concrete process yet, but has the U.S. expressed any openness to providing material support to getting these foreign fighters out if that were to be something that’s needed?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>We’ve talked about lending diplomatic support to the process, and until we really have a better idea of what the process is, I don’t think we’re in a position to talk about &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any numbers at all on either side?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> I mean, people talk – they throw out the number 300 on each side.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Total? 300 fighters?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> To start with on – as an initial tranche.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, but what would the total be?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> To bring out.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>There are thousands.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> She’s asking the total number of &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Oh, how many are there?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible.) There are thousands.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong> Oh, there’s – there are 6,000 Syrians at least.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On both sides combined, you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> No. I think just on the Turkish side there’s 6,000 Syrians. Is that right, , or &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>Yeah. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And that 300 is both sides, Turkish and Russian side?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Do you have 300 from each side &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> This is all sort of notional still here. I don’t want to send the message that the process has been launched.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>But the idea, if it’s ever launched &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> &#8212; Chadians, Sudanese, Janjaweed, Syrians, eventually they all go. There’s got to be a tranche process.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> If there are thousands on the Turkish side, how many are there on the other side?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>Thousands.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thousands?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What does the United States think about Ankara’s position that they are invited?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> The Turks assert, as they did today, that the memorandum of understanding they’ve reached with the Serraj government some years ago continues to apply.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> We don’t dispute that, but we are focused on how to get beyond that.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> And I would simply note I think there is a growing recognition, which is a healthy one, that in a circumstance which we all hope is realized in the course of the coming months where there is a new government that emerges from the elections on December 24th (inaudible) a unified military structure. There is going to have to be a new arrangement for whatever form, if there is one, of train, advise, assist forces are there to help the new unified Libyan Armed Forces. That doesn’t take us to that happy goal tomorrow, and I can’t tell you at, what, 3:00 p.m. plus five it will happen. But that’s certainly the objective, and I think there’s a recognition that things change when there is a government post-election, when there is a unified Libyan military. And referencing to now four-year-old MOUs with a government which would then be twice removed is not going to carry you all that far.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Who picked December 24 for the election?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> The – it was one of the Libyan – or some of the Libyan participants in this LPDF.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I mean, I recognize that – I mean, it’s just like – seems designed for people not to be paying attention to it in most of the countries who are represented here today.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Grinch.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I recognize that – the Grinch? Okay. Yeah, I think that’s (inaudible) &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> No. And let’s give &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; going to get. But, I mean, why have an election on a day when no one in this group, most people who are attending the conference, are really going to be having their eye on the ball?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> This was not done with any view to the Western calendar. This was done &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, clearly. And I think that says my entire point.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> And the Libyans would say: So what? We’re not here to please the West. We’re trying to salvage our country.</p>
<p>And what people didn’t want, I think, was to have this drag into next year and have it keep being put off. But they pushed it off obviously as late as they could this year. I don’t know where the 24th comes in in terms of the Muslim calendar in December, but we have to – we should give credit to Stephanie Williams and the LPDF process, because basically that process took 74 people and had them make decisions about the future of Libya politically that have so far managed to stick, and that’s quite an achievement. And now the challenge is to keep it going.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I don’t – I mean, it’s fine for the Libyans to have – they can have – anyone can have their election on any day they want to. But in the – in a situation like this where you have conferences – this is the second one, right – where there are a ton of Western countries involved and any number of things can go wrong, are you going to tell me that any of the countries who are interested, with some few exceptions, are really going to be in a position on Christmas Eve to – or Christmas or over that week to actually do anything about it besides (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Well, I think we’re going to know before December 24th whether this is going to fall into place. There are going to have to be – we’ll see if there’s some patriotic election monitors and observers who want to go out around that time of year. But, I mean, nobody – you’re the first person who’s ever raised that question with me.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just ask you – you mentioned the commitment to the election. Was that conditional in any way, saying that we need some more support from the outside world? Where do you think the countries are in terms of the (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>I wouldn’t say it was conditional in the way he put it, but I – they will in the same breath say there are definitely going to be obstacles here – security, logistical, financial. But I think they accept our point that, yes, there are obstacles but none of them is insurmountable. And the – there is always a temptation when you’re in power to think you need to stay a little bit longer, and I think the prime minister is understanding that he wants to resist that temptation in the interests of the country.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On the – you said that the process is not a concrete one. So what is next? What is going to make it more concrete? What should we expect, or should we just wait for some withdrawals to (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>I would – let’s just say I’m not in a position to give you any detail on that, so I don’t want to speculate.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How would you describe America’s national interest in the outcome here?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Libya had the potential and potential – could still have the potential to be another ungoverned space where terrorists can operate with impunity. ISIS was quite well-installed in Libya, had to be beaten back. In the last month, there have been two small attacks, again, in Libya that were claimed by ISIS. And so it’s a reminder that the terrorist issue has not gone away, and I think for us that’s a primary interest.</p>
<p>The Russian involvement in Libya has turned this now into something that has geopolitical implications for the United States, and it’s on NATO’s southern flank that the Russians have embedded. They are projecting influence into sub-Saharan Africa. Wagner is – we don’t accept that this is a private company; it’s an armed Russian state, and they’re carrying out Russia’s strategic objectives in sub-Saharan Africa and in the southern Med.</p>
<p>Libya is a huge supplier of oil and gas; that’s not the driving interest that it might have been at one time, but it’s still a factor in global economic affairs.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And migration also?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> The migration issue.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>The migration issue is – it’s sort of not directly related to us, but to the extent it’s a tool to destabilize allies and partners in Europe, of course it’s an issue. And it’s a humanitarian issue. More Libyans are going to drown every day now because there’s a lot of migrants in Libya who at one point might have been happy to be there and do menial labor or have a job or whatever, but now because of the instability and the fighting and the fact the country hasn’t recovered yet, they’re not sticking around. And so from just a humanitarian perspective and a political perspective of the Europeans, you want to try to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> I know  has to take off shortly, so , is there anything you want to say just on the bilateral piece?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> Yeah, let me just say I think you’ve heard really a good summary of the topics and the tone when the two foreign – Foreign Minister Maas and the Secretary gave their on-the-record press conference, so I don’t think there’s a lot I can add there. The foreign minister thanked the Secretary for coming back to Europe, returning to Europe this week, underscored the Germany guiding principle of foreign policy of course is multilateralism, and thanked the United States for re-engagement, revitalization of so many multilateral fora. The fact that this is a week after President Biden came to Europe and participated in that series of summits that you’re very familiar with, he came first to Europe. A combined bilateral and multilateral diplomacy engagement was important.</p>
<p>Both of them talked (inaudible) about how there’s a focus on strengthening our own countries, and of course that’s why strong bilateral relations and multilateral relations are good, delivering results efficiently, productively, effectively for our own citizens is something we can do together, and I think they highlighted the fact that the competitive advantage that we have, and you can see this with the President’s progression from the G7 to the NATO summit to the U.S.-EU summit, is indeed the set of partnerships and alliances that we have where the partners and allies themselves choose to come together and support each other through these structures we’ve created. And the Secretary highlighted a response to the thanks that the minister gave for him coming here; in fact, wanted to recognize German leadership on issues like Libya and what my unnamed colleague here has just described. And the Secretary gave the foreign minister a fuller readout of the President Biden meeting with President Putin, just a chance to go into more details there, and promised, of course, to keep in close consultation on those set of issues. Safe to underscore we are very clear-eyed and sober in terms of relations with Russia.</p>
<p>Of course, the foreign minister highlighted the German elections, which are very much on people’s minds here. As we’ve seen in other fora, Russian efforts to influence German elections of course are something they keep a close eye on. They also were able to talk about Turkey, including a readout with a little more detail of the President’s meeting with President Erdogan, and focus on Afghanistan, and the work on maintaining a strong diplomatic mission there as the troops draw down, including international zone security and other issues. They touched on Belarus and highlighted the strong unity that’s remained between the U.S., the EU, and of course the UK, and Canada as well in terms of coordinating our sanctions and our response, and looking at ways to respond to things like the Ryanair incident and the other sort of outrageous crackdown that Lukashenko has perpetrated against people there who were just speaking out for fundamental rights and for a government that delivers for them.</p>
<p>They did talk about Syria and the humanitarian access issue that is important, of course, for – with the UN. Also touched on Iraq, and talked about the critical elections coming up there, our joint support for UNAMI and election monitoring, since you bring up elections. And did talk about Ukraine, of course; reviewed the Normandy format and the fact that there is a dynamic still there, albeit a tough one. And then, of course, as you guys asked and the Secretary described, they did discuss Nord Stream 2 and – in the context of this extremely broad and collegial, familial relationship where we’re able to pursue so much with the Germans, we do have a big difference on that particular issue. Both sides have acknowledged that. And we need to find a way to get to some significant steps in terms of the – mitigating the threats as the Secretary said on the record. And I think the minister acknowledged that and the fact that they were tackling this &#8212; well, and I won’t go into more of the details there, but that diplomacy continues, but I think, again, underscores what they both said: The broad relationship and its robust set of issues on which we’re working together is really quite, quite strong. And that allows us then to have an area where we disagree quite strongly, as the foreign minister acknowledged; he’s heard the Secretary and the U.S. position on this, and they’ll keep working on it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can you – , can I ask you about – there was a report today that the French and German have agreed together to invite President Putin to come and visit, and I wondered if that – this was brought in the EU, much to the dismay of the Baltic states. It was a big story in the FT this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> Sorry, I missed that. It did not come up in their meeting.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But I wonder if that was something that was discussed at all in the President’s meetings last week or discussed &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE: </strong>That, I wouldn’t be able to help you on. We’ve gotten no readouts.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Anything on it? Is this, like, totally news to you?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> To me, I’m not following Putin’s travels or this FT story. But &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, the story was about Macron and Merkel, that they agreed to do this, and they told the EU today that they want to do it.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> I’d just &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> &#8212; talk to them. I know in the Normandy format, they’re looking at a foreign ministers meeting &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, no, this was &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> &#8212; which is a step they’ve been talking about for some time.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So – just to be clear, then, so the chancellor didn’t pose the idea of having Russia come to some future EU meeting in the meeting with the Secretary today?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> I really don’t know what the chancellor has said. I was not in the meeting with the chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Got it.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> But in the meeting with Foreign Minister Maas, there was not a discussion, but they did discuss at the EU foreign ministers meeting yesterday, talked about having – for instance, the Iraqi foreign minister was there and they went through the kind of issues, they talked there. But that piece didn’t come up in the bilat meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister Maas.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, then let me just get in a Nord Stream 2 question. So, I mean, he was asked by one of the German reporters, I think, that – could there be an agreement on how you mitigate the Russian threat by the time that Merkel visits Washington, and he said, well, that’ll be great if it could happen, but – I know you don’t want to get into it, but how advanced are these discussions? Is there any common ground here on how they can actually do it? And the white paper that – or the non-paper – sorry – Jake gave to the German delegation before the President came here with U.S. suggestions, how &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, he – so after the decision on the – you know this, . Let’s – don’t play dumb.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> We’re going down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Laughter) Where we were back in Iceland and the sanctions announcement came out with the waivers, right, the Germans sent the team to Washington.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. And they reiterated their proposal from, like, two years ago about how they were going to try to allay your concerns. I won’t go into those details, but you know them well. Anyway, in response, Jake or someone at the NSC presented them with a response. And they came back here, they had been discussing this. I want to know where that stands, and if you think that there is any possibility that by the time that Merkel visits Washington there could be some kind of a resolution to this.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> I would agree violently with the Secretary that that would be a good thing and that we’re both – both sides are working hard on this. But it’s the kind of diplomacy and discussion and engagement. Today is another useful step there, and again, I wasn’t in the meeting with the chancellor, so to just keep at it. (Inaudible) And obviously, everybody’s aware of the various timelines, and certainly we all want to see the chancellor’s visit in Washington to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> One more data point on Sunday. The Secretary will have an opportunity to meet with the Israeli foreign minister in Rome. We will have a bilateral engagement with Foreign Minister Lapid on Sunday. We’ll have more details on the timing of that as it comes together, but wanted to pass that along as well.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the federal foreign office.  A very warm welcome to Berlin, dear Tony, or rather, welcome back.  After all, weren’t you in Europe only last week?  And during that visit, President Biden and your delegation underlined impressively that America is back, back on the international and multilateral scene, and we’re extremely pleased about this.</p>
<p>The world has not stopped turning over the last few years.  What we need these days is, above all, transatlantic collaboration and solidarity and a division of labor, and we need that more than ever before.  I am delighted that your first bilateral visit, working visit to Europe has brought you to Berlin today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Today, we are hosting the second Libya conference.  We want to ensure that Libya can once again enjoy sustainable peace and a stable situation, and we want to prepare the ground for that and make sure that we get international support.  We are focusing on three points: holding (inaudible) elections, withdrawal of foreign fighters and mercenaries, and unifying the security forces of the country.  And we will also use the opportunity to also focus on the economic development in Europe and providing support, to the extent possible, to us.</p>
<p>Of course, we also talked about a number of other issues today.  The sixth round of negotiations on restoring the Iran nuclear deal ended last Sunday.  Again, the talks in Vienna were very intensive.  We are making progress, but there’s still a few hard nuts to crack, as we all know only too well, and we also know that the environment of the negotiations continues to be very complex now that elections have taken place in Iran.</p>
<p>We also talked about Ukraine and the talks in the N4 format with the objective of putting an end to the conflict in the east of the country.  What is obvious is that no one can be satisfied about the present state of affairs, the status quo.  We insist that the Minsk agreements need to be implemented, and we need to inject new dynamic into the process.  And right now, we are preparing the substance for another meeting of the foreign ministers of the N4, and it is extremely good and extremely helpful to have the United States supporting us in this.</p>
<p>Of course, we also talked about the outcome of the bilateral talks between President Biden and President Putin.  We stand ready to support the strategic dialogue on arms control and armament agreed by both sides as best as we can, and we believe that this has been an extraordinary success achieved through these talks, and we are very grateful to President Biden for having taken the initiative.</p>
<p>The mere fact of affirming the so-called Reagan-Gorbachev formula that goes “A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought” has been an extremely important signal by these two presidents.</p>
<p>Now as we talk about all these subjects, we’re quite aware of the fact that even if we are linking arms across the Atlantic with likeminded countries, this does not mean that conflicts or missiles are going to vanish overnight.  But if we all act in concert, I believe we can produce a much greater impact.  The day before yesterday, such an impact was quite visible because on the very same day, the United States, Canada, and the European Union and Great Britain agreed on sanctions – determined sanctions against the regime in Belarus.  And that is an indication of the fact that if we stand together in assuming responsibility, we stand a chance of making our values future-proof and make them – make and ensure them being respected.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we will also be acting in the spirit of our shared future.  We will meet at the Holocaust Memorial and use that opportunity to discuss our cooperation and to enhance our cooperation to advance something that has been in both our interests, and that is the fight against anti-Semitism wherever it occurs, and it occurs still far too often.  In the afternoon, we will have the opportunity to talk to young adults about the future of transatlantic relations.  I very much look forward to these exchanges, and I’m grateful for the fact that Tony Blinken has come here today.  Thank you very much indeed.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, Heiko, thank you for a very productive meeting, but thank you, even more importantly, for your friendship and close collaboration these past few months.  It’s been terrifically important to me, important to the United States.  We’re grateful for your partnership, we’re grateful for the partnership with Germany across the board, and it’s a particular pleasure for me to be back in Berlin for the first time as Secretary of State, although many, many visits in different capacities before then.  I very much look forward to having a chance to see the chancellor later this afternoon following the very good meeting that we had and to be here, as Heiko said, so soon after the G7 meeting, the NATO meeting, the U.S.-EU Leaders Summit.</p>
<p>As President Biden said last week at the European Council, at a time when we have such vast changes taking place around the world – many good, some not so good – the best way for countries to deal with these changes is by working together.  And I think Heiko and I both strongly agree that there is probably not a single challenge that is having an impact on the lives of our citizens – whether it’s climate change, whether it’s this pandemic, whether it is the destructive impact of emerging technologies – that can be addressed by any one country acting alone.  We have an imperative, maybe more than ever before, to find ways to cooperate, work together, coordinate, and that’s exactly what the United States and Germany are doing.</p>
<p>That’s how we’ll ultimately end the COVID-19 pandemic, which is becoming, unfortunately, more dangerous in some parts of the world even as it’s increasingly under control in others.  It’s how we’ll tackle the climate crisis and protect our planet, our security, our health, while building a greener global economy.  It’s how we’ll maintain our security in the face of old and new threats.  And ultimately, it’s how we’ll protect our shared values and defend human rights and democracy both at home and around the world.  And in all of this, I think our common challenge, which we very much agree on, is the need to demonstrate together that democracies can deliver effectively for our citizens and indeed deliver for the world.</p>
<p>Germany and the United States have demonstrated time and again that we believe in cooperation bilaterally, multilaterally.  We’re both committed to multilateralism.  And that’s one reason why I’m visiting France and Italy after my time here in Berlin.  In addition to being three of our closest and most capable partners, Germany, France, and Italy are the only three countries that are members of the EU, NATO, and the G7, and that underscores the importance that all of us attach to working cooperatively in multilateral institutions.</p>
<p>We’ve worked closely together over the past several months in the lead-up to the summits that President Biden took part in, then at the summits themselves, to take on some of the most urgent challenges of our time and to help ensure that these institutions are as effective, adaptive, and innovative as possible.</p>
<p>But that work doesn’t end with the summits.  In a sense, it starts there.  It continues this week and beyond as we follow up on the steps that leaders took at NATO with the 2030 reform agenda and making sure the Alliance has the capability it needs; at the G7, where we committed to supply one billion COVID-19 vaccines to the world, end support for coal-fired power plants, partner with developing countries on infrastructure projects through Build Back Better, and at the U.S.-EU summit, where we pledged greater cooperation, deeper cooperation on trade and technology in particular.</p>
<p>We’re also working closely together to address regional challenges.  We’ll see that this afternoon when we gather with leaders from Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe, as well as the United Nations, at the Berlin II Conference on Libya.  And I want to thank Germany for its very important leadership on this issue.  As I’ll share at the meeting and as you heard from Heiko, we share the goal of a sovereign, stable, unified, secure Libya free from foreign interference.  It’s what the people of Libya deserve.  It’s critical to regional security as well.</p>
<p>For that to happen, national elections need to go forward in December, and that means urgent agreement is needed on constitutional and legal issues that would undergird those elections.  And the October 23rd ceasefire agreement has to be fully implemented, including by withdrawing all foreign forces from Libya.  We’re grateful, again, to Germany for hosting this meeting and for the longstanding leadership that it’s shown on this topic and so many others.  We’re very proud to be your partner, Heiko, in this endeavor.</p>
<p>And that brings me to a final point that I want to make today.  In addition to the work that we do together through regional and global conferences and institutions, we’re deeply committed to the bilateral relationship between Germany and the United States.  Simply put, Germany is among our closest friends and closest partners in the entire world.</p>
<p>It’s true, of course, on a governmental level, and I know President Biden is very much looking forward to welcoming Chancellor Merkel to Washington next month.</p>
<p>It’s true on an economic level.  As we see and know every single day, Germany is our largest trading partner in Europe.  We’re your largest export market, and hundreds of thousands of Germans work for American companies and vice versa.</p>
<p>It’s true on a person-to-person level.  The people of Germany and the people of the United States are connected in so many ways – family ties that stretch back for generations, young people studying in each other’s universities.  And like Heiko, I’m looking forward tomorrow to meeting with some of the alumni of our transatlantic youth exchange programs and talking to another generation of young Germans and Americans.</p>
<p>Our troops have stood shoulder to shoulder around the world.  We’re grateful to Germany for hosting U.S. troops, which serves our joint security.</p>
<p>And we’re connected, finally, by a shared commitment to democratic values, values that we’ll honor tomorrow when, as the foreign minister said, we will visit the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe together to reaffirm our commitment to human rights and dignity, to discuss how we can ensure that the lessons of the Holocaust are never forgotten.</p>
<p>I am reminded of something President Biden said recently at the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre in the United States.  He talked about how great nations face the lessons of their history no matter how painful they are.  And they do all that they can to repair whatever injustice can be repaired and build a better, fairer future.  Germany is a model to the world for how to do that.</p>
<p>So we’re grateful for the friendship.  We want it to be even stronger.  We don’t always agree.  The foreign minister and I spoke today about one of those areas of disagreement, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which we continue to believe is a threat to Europe’s energy security.  Germany has a different perspective, and that happens from time to time among friends, and we’ll handle our disagreements while pressing ahead on the many areas where we are working very closely together and are very much in agreement.</p>
<p>In this case, that means that Germany and the United States will keep standing together against any dangerous or provocative actions by Russia, whether that’s encroaching on Ukraine’s territory or imprisoning Aleksey Navalny or spreading disinformation in our democracies.  That’s what effective cooperation between countries looks like.  That’s what Germany and the United States are delivering together.</p>
<p>So thank you again, Mr. Foreign Minister, Heiko, for this partnership, for this very good work that we’re doing together, and my thanks to everyone here for the very warm reception we’ve already had.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Unfortunately, we have very limited time left due to following schedules, but the first question goes to Reuters, and please, a short question would be much appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Via interpreter)  Andreas Rinke from Reuters.  A question addressed to the foreign – Secretary of State:  As far as Libya is concerned, what do you expect from the Americans?  What should they deliver?</p>
<p>(In English) And Foreign Secretary, question to you, on the same question:  What is the U.S. willing to do?  Boots on the ground in anti-terror fight in the Sahel region, or what else?</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Well, today – today, it is first and foremost about Libya, and I’m extremely grateful to Tony Blinken for making sure that the United States are very engaged on this dossier, much more active than we have come to expect over the past few years.  Today is about reaffirming that elections take place on the 24th of September, that all foreign fighters are withdrawn, and that that is affirmed at this conference, and that then adds a step-by-step process – that this is then to take place as a step-by-step process.  In Libya too, it is important that the security forces on the ground are being unified – the security forces of the country.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, it is very important that the international community and those parties that played a part in the conflict play their part and do their bit.  And this is why I am very grateful to Tony Blinken and the American administration in Washington for being here today and for actively helping us develop that process.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  And I really wouldn’t and couldn’t say anything differently.  We have exactly the same objectives both for this meeting and for moving forward in terms of the steps that need to be taken to make sure that elections go forward in December, that the ceasefire continues to be fully implemented, and that all foreign forces leave Libya.  I think we have an opportunity that we have not had in recent years to really help Libya move forward as a safe, secure, sovereign country, and we’re determined together to seize that opportunity.</p>
<p>I think, again, Germany’s leadership in a very sustained way in bringing the international community together in support of Libya, in support of its progress is vitally, vitally important, and I hope that we’ll continue to move in the right direction today and the days that follow.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Our first question goes to the VOA, Cindy Saine.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes, (inaudible).  Secretary Blinken mentioned the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.</p>
<p>And for Foreign Minister Maas, what is Germany prepared to do to reassure the United States and Ukraine that Russia will not use the pipeline to pressure Ukraine or to harm them?</p>
<p>And for Secretary Blinken, in your discussions with the foreign minister, what measures are you considering implementing that could automatically trigger if Russia does pressure?</p>
<p>And for both of you, are you worried about threatening statements that Russian President Putin has made that he would exclude Ukraine from energy?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter)  During our conversation today, Tony was very clear in impressing upon me that as far as Nord Stream 2 is concerned, Washington has expectations of Germany and that expectations are that we make sure that President Putin cannot misuse the pipeline to exert pressure on Ukraine.  We are quite aware of this, and we want to make our contribution in that regard.</p>
<p>In the past, already we started to work in that direction by making sure that there is an alternative gas transit agreement via the Ukraine and that we’ll continue to stand – and that we’ll continue to stand once Nord Stream 2 goes operational.  We are right now in the midst of talks about how we can fulfill these expectations that Washington has of us.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  And thank you.  And we appreciate the important conversations that we’re having with Germany on this issue.  Right now, as I said earlier, this is one place where we disagree.  We believe, we continue to believe, that the pipeline is ultimately a Russian geopolitical project that threatens European energy security and potentially undermines the security of Ukraine and other countries in the region.</p>
<p>We recently imposed sanctions, more sanctions than have ever been imposed under the law, against a number of Russian entities involved in the pipeline.  And at the same time, we waived certain sanctions with regard to Nord Stream 2 AG and its CEO.  And the context is this:  By the time we took office, the pipeline as a matter of its physical construction was more than 90 percent complete.  That was the reality.  That’s something we inherited.</p>
<p>And we’re determined to see if we can make something positive out of a difficult situation that we inherited and to do what we can to make sure that the end result is that Europe’s energy security is not undermined – in fact, it’s strengthened; that Ukraine’s position is not weakened, that it’s actually reinforced.  And that is the nature of the conversations that we’re having with our German partners.</p>
<p>Our goal remains to ensure that Russia cannot use energy as a coercive tool, as a weapon, against Ukraine or anyone else in Europe, and I appreciate the work that we’re doing with Germany to move in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  The next question from Süddeutsche Zeitung, Herr Broessler.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Via interpreter)  Minister Maas, if I may, I would like to come back to Nord Stream 2.  With respect to the talks you mentioned, is there a timeframe for these talks?  Do both sides have the wish to solve this problem before the federal chancellor, Ms. Merkel, will visit Washington?  And more specifically, the Ukraine has asked Germany to provide guarantees.  Would Germany, for example, be willing to make good or compensate for the loss of transit fees?</p>
<p>(In English)  And Secretary Blinken, from what you said, can we understand that you have given up on the goal to not have Nord Stream Zwei completed or at least go operational?  And in case it is completed, is it your wish to have tools to stop gas transit via Nord Stream Zwei if need be?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via intrerpreter)  Probably we are able to save the world at large, but people would still ask us about Nord Stream 2.  Well, we’ll have to accept it and live with it.</p>
<p>We are engaging in these talks.  We are aware of the expectations from Washington, and it is of the utmost importance to us to reach results here that can also be supported by Washington.  As I said, we are engaging in these talks with our colleagues from the American administration in Washington, but we are also engaging with the Ukraine.  The Ukrainian foreign minister came to Berlin the week before last, and of course, we talked about this issue.</p>
<p>But as I said, we are engaging in these negotiations also with an eye to Eastern Europe and the – with an eye to the energy situation in more general terms.  There is a whole host of ways and means and approaches which we are discussing right now, but we are not discussing them in public.  And of course, I would wish us to make headway and achieve a result as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>As I said – as was said, the visit of the federal chancellor in Washington would be a suitable timeline, but of course, we cannot make it contingent only on this particular matter.  In August, legislative decisions are coming in Washington, so we have the ambition to have made headway on these issues and to have reached results that are acceptable to all parties involved.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>I share the views that the foreign minister just expressed.  I’m not going to address what might happen hypothetically in the future.  I think what’s important and what we agree on is that in the conversations that we’re having, in the talks that we’re having together, we need to produce very credible, concrete results to, again, ensure that Russia cannot use energy as a coercive tool directed at Ukraine or anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  We’ll go to Humeyra Pamuk of Reuters.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello, thank you.  I would like to ask about Iran first.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Maas, you just said, like, there are some nuts to be cracked still, and Jake Sullivan also over the weekend said there are still issues.  What is your sense on how close the two sides are on a deal, and until when are you willing to keep negotiating?</p>
<p>And then if I can move on to China quickly.  The United States says America is back, and you two talked a lot about multilateralism, but – and while – and Europe appears to be genuinely pleased to see that America is back.  But you have deep disagreements on a number of important topics, and China is one.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Maas, isn’t that weighing on the bilateral relationship?</p>
<p>And Secretary Blinken, you’ve said China’s treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang amount to genocide.  Are you urging the German Government to call on German companies to perhaps cease operations in Xinjiang?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter) As regards China, of course, this is a topic that we are engaging on.  We always touch upon China.  China is important for us, for the German Government but also for the European Union, and thus it is important that the European Union has a joint strategy regarding China.</p>
<p>I think we have made it clear in the last few weeks that we are capable of acting together.  Because of the human rights violations in Xinjiang, the human rights violations of the rights of the Uyghurs, we have made it clear that we have been able to agree on sanctions, and we have harmonized our actions with the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, with the European Union regarding, for example, Belarus.</p>
<p>We want to cooperate closely with the United States apart from the historic friendship existing between both our countries and peoples, also with respect to an eye what we owe to the United States, with an eye to the Second World War and the period that followed.  We are much better and have a greater impact if we act together and coordinate our actions, and thus we have a great interest in making sure that our China strategy is coordinated closely across the Atlantic between Germany and the United States and the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p>And as far as the negotiations in Vienna are concerned, they are not easy.  In the past few weeks, that has become quite obvious.  There are a whole host of technical issues that need solving still.  We are making headway step by step, one round of negotiations after the other, and we expect that now that a new government has been elected there are good opportunities for negotiations to continue and be concluded.</p>
<p>We, for one, are convinced that it is worthwhile to engaging with the other parties even over such a longer period of time and to ensuring that the JCPOA is being revitalized and revived.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  And coming back to China, I think what you’re seeing and what you saw particularly in the last week is a growing convergence of views in terms of how to deal with China.  We recognize that all of our countries have complex and consequential relationships with China that can’t be summed up in a bumper sticker.  And whether it’s the United States, whether it’s Europe, we’re seeing, as we’ve said before, adversarial aspects of the relationship, competitive ones, and also cooperative ones.</p>
<p>But the common denominator is we’re all going to be more effective in engaging China in any of those areas when we’re working and acting together.  And increasingly, we’re demonstrating that we can do that.  I think it was evident in the work that was done at the G7, at NATO, at the U.S.-EU Summit.  I’d remind you that with regard to the G7, the last time previous to this G7 meeting that there was a meeting, China didn’t even factor into the equation, into the communique.  And at NATO we’ve agreed to renew and revitalize our strategic concept.  The last time that was done in 2010, again, China was not – was not even mentioned.</p>
<p>But I think what’s very important here to recognize – and this is what brings us together – is we are not about containing China or holding China back.  What we are about is upholding the free and open rules-based international order that we have spent so many decades building, investing in, working on together.  And if that order is challenged in any way by anyone, we will stand up and defend it.  And that’s not directed at China.  It’s about defending the order.</p>
<p>But more – as important, I think what you saw from the United States and Europe across so many different areas was an affirmative vision for what the future can and should be.  For example, the work that we did together at the G7 with Build Back Better for the World, where we will come together as countries pooling some of our development resources to help other countries develop their infrastructure and to do it to the highest standards and the most positive way.  The work that we’re doing together on vaccines – a billion vaccines for the world with no political strings attached.  All of this shows that we can come together and deliver effectively.</p>
<p>Last word.  When it comes to Xinjiang, when it comes to genocide, human rights abuses, I think what’s incumbent upon all of us to do whatever we can to make sure that products that may be the result of forced labor are not coming into our countries, and similarly that we’re not exporting to any country, China or otherwise, technologies or products that can be used to repress people and deny them their human rights.  We’ve done work on that.  That was clear last week as well on forced labor.  And as the foreign minister said, we’ve come together to sanction China for the actions that it’s taken against Uyghurs and others in Xinjiang.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the federal foreign office.  A very warm welcome to Berlin, dear Tony, or rather, welcome back.  After all, weren’t you in Europe only last week?  And during that visit, President Biden and your delegation underlined impressively that America is back, back on the international and multilateral scene, and we’re extremely pleased about this.</p>
<p>The world has not stopped turning over the last few years.  What we need these days is, above all, transatlantic collaboration and solidarity and a division of labor, and we need that more than ever before.  I am delighted that your first bilateral visit, working visit to Europe has brought you to Berlin today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Today, we are hosting the second Libya conference.  We want to ensure that Libya can once again enjoy sustainable peace and a stable situation, and we want to prepare the ground for that and make sure that we get international support.  We are focusing on three points: holding (inaudible) elections, withdrawal of foreign fighters and mercenaries, and unifying the security forces of the country.  And we will also use the opportunity to also focus on the economic development in Europe and providing support, to the extent possible, to us.</p>
<p>Of course, we also talked about a number of other issues today.  The sixth round of negotiations on restoring the Iran nuclear deal ended last Sunday.  Again, the talks in Vienna were very intensive.  We are making progress, but there’s still a few hard nuts to crack, as we all know only too well, and we also know that the environment of the negotiations continues to be very complex now that elections have taken place in Iran.</p>
<p>We also talked about Ukraine and the talks in the N4 format with the objective of putting an end to the conflict in the east of the country.  What is obvious is that no one can be satisfied about the present state of affairs, the status quo.  We insist that the Minsk agreements need to be implemented, and we need to inject new dynamic into the process.  And right now, we are preparing the substance for another meeting of the foreign ministers of the N4, and it is extremely good and extremely helpful to have the United States supporting us in this.</p>
<p>Of course, we also talked about the outcome of the bilateral talks between President Biden and President Putin.  We stand ready to support the strategic dialogue on arms control and armament agreed by both sides as best as we can, and we believe that this has been an extraordinary success achieved through these talks, and we are very grateful to President Biden for having taken the initiative.</p>
<p>The mere fact of affirming the so-called Reagan-Gorbachev formula that goes “A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought” has been an extremely important signal by these two presidents.</p>
<p>Now as we talk about all these subjects, we’re quite aware of the fact that even if we are linking arms across the Atlantic with likeminded countries, this does not mean that conflicts or missiles are going to vanish overnight.  But if we all act in concert, I believe we can produce a much greater impact.  The day before yesterday, such an impact was quite visible because on the very same day, the United States, Canada, and the European Union and Great Britain agreed on sanctions – determined sanctions against the regime in Belarus.  And that is an indication of the fact that if we stand together in assuming responsibility, we stand a chance of making our values future-proof and make them – make and ensure them being respected.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we will also be acting in the spirit of our shared future.  We will meet at the Holocaust Memorial and use that opportunity to discuss our cooperation and to enhance our cooperation to advance something that has been in both our interests, and that is the fight against anti-Semitism wherever it occurs, and it occurs still far too often.  In the afternoon, we will have the opportunity to talk to young adults about the future of transatlantic relations.  I very much look forward to these exchanges, and I’m grateful for the fact that Tony Blinken has come here today.  Thank you very much indeed.</p>

<p>In this case, that means that Germany and the United States will keep standing together against any dangerous or provocative actions by Russia, whether that’s encroaching on Ukraine’s territory or imprisoning Aleksey Navalny or spreading disinformation in our democracies.  That’s what effective cooperation between countries looks like.  That’s what Germany and the United States are delivering together.</p>
<p>So thank you again, Mr. Foreign Minister, Heiko, for this partnership, for this very good work that we’re doing together, and my thanks to everyone here for the very warm reception we’ve already had.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Unfortunately, we have very limited time left due to following schedules, but the first question goes to Reuters, and please, a short question would be much appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Via interpreter)  Andreas Rinke from Reuters.  A question addressed to the foreign – Secretary of State:  As far as Libya is concerned, what do you expect from the Americans?  What should they deliver?</p>
<p>(In English) And Foreign Secretary, question to you, on the same question:  What is the U.S. willing to do?  Boots on the ground in anti-terror fight in the Sahel region, or what else?</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Well, today – today, it is first and foremost about Libya, and I’m extremely grateful to Tony Blinken for making sure that the United States are very engaged on this dossier, much more active than we have come to expect over the past few years.  Today is about reaffirming that elections take place on the 24th of September, that all foreign fighters are withdrawn, and that that is affirmed at this conference, and that then adds a step-by-step process – that this is then to take place as a step-by-step process.  In Libya too, it is important that the security forces on the ground are being unified – the security forces of the country.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, it is very important that the international community and those parties that played a part in the conflict play their part and do their bit.  And this is why I am very grateful to Tony Blinken and the American administration in Washington for being here today and for actively helping us develop that process.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  And I really wouldn’t and couldn’t say anything differently.  We have exactly the same objectives both for this meeting and for moving forward in terms of the steps that need to be taken to make sure that elections go forward in December, that the ceasefire continues to be fully implemented, and that all foreign forces leave Libya.  I think we have an opportunity that we have not had in recent years to really help Libya move forward as a safe, secure, sovereign country, and we’re determined together to seize that opportunity.</p>
<p>I think, again, Germany’s leadership in a very sustained way in bringing the international community together in support of Libya, in support of its progress is vitally, vitally important, and I hope that we’ll continue to move in the right direction today and the days that follow.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Our first question goes to the VOA, Cindy Saine.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes, (inaudible).  Secretary Blinken mentioned the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.</p>
<p>And for Foreign Minister Maas, what is Germany prepared to do to reassure the United States and Ukraine that Russia will not use the pipeline to pressure Ukraine or to harm them?</p>
<p>And for Secretary Blinken, in your discussions with the foreign minister, what measures are you considering implementing that could automatically trigger if Russia does pressure?</p>
<p>And for both of you, are you worried about threatening statements that Russian President Putin has made that he would exclude Ukraine from energy?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter)  During our conversation today, Tony was very clear in impressing upon me that as far as Nord Stream 2 is concerned, Washington has expectations of Germany and that expectations are that we make sure that President Putin cannot misuse the pipeline to exert pressure on Ukraine.  We are quite aware of this, and we want to make our contribution in that regard.</p>
<p>In the past, already we started to work in that direction by making sure that there is an alternative gas transit agreement via the Ukraine and that we’ll continue to stand – and that we’ll continue to stand once Nord Stream 2 goes operational.  We are right now in the midst of talks about how we can fulfill these expectations that Washington has of us.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  And thank you.  And we appreciate the important conversations that we’re having with Germany on this issue.  Right now, as I said earlier, this is one place where we disagree.  We believe, we continue to believe, that the pipeline is ultimately a Russian geopolitical project that threatens European energy security and potentially undermines the security of Ukraine and other countries in the region.</p>
<p>We recently imposed sanctions, more sanctions than have ever been imposed under the law, against a number of Russian entities involved in the pipeline.  And at the same time, we waived certain sanctions with regard to Nord Stream 2 AG and its CEO.  And the context is this:  By the time we took office, the pipeline as a matter of its physical construction was more than 90 percent complete.  That was the reality.  That’s something we inherited.</p>
<p>And we’re determined to see if we can make something positive out of a difficult situation that we inherited and to do what we can to make sure that the end result is that Europe’s energy security is not undermined – in fact, it’s strengthened; that Ukraine’s position is not weakened, that it’s actually reinforced.  And that is the nature of the conversations that we’re having with our German partners.</p>
<p>Our goal remains to ensure that Russia cannot use energy as a coercive tool, as a weapon, against Ukraine or anyone else in Europe, and I appreciate the work that we’re doing with Germany to move in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  The next question from Süddeutsche Zeitung, Herr Broessler.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Via interpreter)  Minister Maas, if I may, I would like to come back to Nord Stream 2.  With respect to the talks you mentioned, is there a timeframe for these talks?  Do both sides have the wish to solve this problem before the federal chancellor, Ms. Merkel, will visit Washington?  And more specifically, the Ukraine has asked Germany to provide guarantees.  Would Germany, for example, be willing to make good or compensate for the loss of transit fees?</p>
<p>(In English)  And Secretary Blinken, from what you said, can we understand that you have given up on the goal to not have Nord Stream Zwei completed or at least go operational?  And in case it is completed, is it your wish to have tools to stop gas transit via Nord Stream Zwei if need be?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via intrerpreter)  Probably we are able to save the world at large, but people would still ask us about Nord Stream 2.  Well, we’ll have to accept it and live with it.</p>
<p>We are engaging in these talks.  We are aware of the expectations from Washington, and it is of the utmost importance to us to reach results here that can also be supported by Washington.  As I said, we are engaging in these talks with our colleagues from the American administration in Washington, but we are also engaging with the Ukraine.  The Ukrainian foreign minister came to Berlin the week before last, and of course, we talked about this issue.</p>
<p>But as I said, we are engaging in these negotiations also with an eye to Eastern Europe and the – with an eye to the energy situation in more general terms.  There is a whole host of ways and means and approaches which we are discussing right now, but we are not discussing them in public.  And of course, I would wish us to make headway and achieve a result as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>As I said – as was said, the visit of the federal chancellor in Washington would be a suitable timeline, but of course, we cannot make it contingent only on this particular matter.  In August, legislative decisions are coming in Washington, so we have the ambition to have made headway on these issues and to have reached results that are acceptable to all parties involved.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>I share the views that the foreign minister just expressed.  I’m not going to address what might happen hypothetically in the future.  I think what’s important and what we agree on is that in the conversations that we’re having, in the talks that we’re having together, we need to produce very credible, concrete results to, again, ensure that Russia cannot use energy as a coercive tool directed at Ukraine or anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  We’ll go to Humeyra Pamuk of Reuters.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello, thank you.  I would like to ask about Iran first.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Maas, you just said, like, there are some nuts to be cracked still, and Jake Sullivan also over the weekend said there are still issues.  What is your sense on how close the two sides are on a deal, and until when are you willing to keep negotiating?</p>
<p>And then if I can move on to China quickly.  The United States says America is back, and you two talked a lot about multilateralism, but – and while – and Europe appears to be genuinely pleased to see that America is back.  But you have deep disagreements on a number of important topics, and China is one.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Maas, isn’t that weighing on the bilateral relationship?</p>
<p>And Secretary Blinken, you’ve said China’s treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang amount to genocide.  Are you urging the German Government to call on German companies to perhaps cease operations in Xinjiang?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter) As regards China, of course, this is a topic that we are engaging on.  We always touch upon China.  China is important for us, for the German Government but also for the European Union, and thus it is important that the European Union has a joint strategy regarding China.</p>
<p>I think we have made it clear in the last few weeks that we are capable of acting together.  Because of the human rights violations in Xinjiang, the human rights violations of the rights of the Uyghurs, we have made it clear that we have been able to agree on sanctions, and we have harmonized our actions with the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, with the European Union regarding, for example, Belarus.</p>
<p>We want to cooperate closely with the United States apart from the historic friendship existing between both our countries and peoples, also with respect to an eye what we owe to the United States, with an eye to the Second World War and the period that followed.  We are much better and have a greater impact if we act together and coordinate our actions, and thus we have a great interest in making sure that our China strategy is coordinated closely across the Atlantic between Germany and the United States and the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p>And as far as the negotiations in Vienna are concerned, they are not easy.  In the past few weeks, that has become quite obvious.  There are a whole host of technical issues that need solving still.  We are making headway step by step, one round of negotiations after the other, and we expect that now that a new government has been elected there are good opportunities for negotiations to continue and be concluded.</p>
<p>We, for one, are convinced that it is worthwhile to engaging with the other parties even over such a longer period of time and to ensuring that the JCPOA is being revitalized and revived.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  And coming back to China, I think what you’re seeing and what you saw particularly in the last week is a growing convergence of views in terms of how to deal with China.  We recognize that all of our countries have complex and consequential relationships with China that can’t be summed up in a bumper sticker.  And whether it’s the United States, whether it’s Europe, we’re seeing, as we’ve said before, adversarial aspects of the relationship, competitive ones, and also cooperative ones.</p>
<p>But the common denominator is we’re all going to be more effective in engaging China in any of those areas when we’re working and acting together.  And increasingly, we’re demonstrating that we can do that.  I think it was evident in the work that was done at the G7, at NATO, at the U.S.-EU Summit.  I’d remind you that with regard to the G7, the last time previous to this G7 meeting that there was a meeting, China didn’t even factor into the equation, into the communique.  And at NATO we’ve agreed to renew and revitalize our strategic concept.  The last time that was done in 2010, again, China was not – was not even mentioned.</p>
<p>But I think what’s very important here to recognize – and this is what brings us together – is we are not about containing China or holding China back.  What we are about is upholding the free and open rules-based international order that we have spent so many decades building, investing in, working on together.  And if that order is challenged in any way by anyone, we will stand up and defend it.  And that’s not directed at China.  It’s about defending the order.</p>
<p>But more – as important, I think what you saw from the United States and Europe across so many different areas was an affirmative vision for what the future can and should be.  For example, the work that we did together at the G7 with Build Back Better for the World, where we will come together as countries pooling some of our development resources to help other countries develop their infrastructure and to do it to the highest standards and the most positive way.  The work that we’re doing together on vaccines – a billion vaccines for the world with no political strings attached.  All of this shows that we can come together and deliver effectively.</p>
<p>Last word.  When it comes to Xinjiang, when it comes to genocide, human rights abuses, I think what’s incumbent upon all of us to do whatever we can to make sure that products that may be the result of forced labor are not coming into our countries, and similarly that we’re not exporting to any country, China or otherwise, technologies or products that can be used to repress people and deny them their human rights.  We’ve done work on that.  That was clear last week as well on forced labor.  And as the foreign minister said, we’ve come together to sanction China for the actions that it’s taken against Uyghurs and others in Xinjiang.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>Chancellery</p>
<p><strong>CHANCELLOR MERKEL:</strong> (Via interpreter) Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to welcome the foreign secretary, the Secretary of State of the United States Antony Blinken, and that I have the opportunity to get to know him a little bit better in his new position.</p>
<p>Actually, what brings him here is the conference on Libya that has taken place this afternoon, and I’m very grateful for the fact that Tony Blinken has set out on this journey to attend this conference because it is very important that we send out a united signal in the direction of Libya that we want to, first and foremost, see that the people of Libya determine their future, but also to indicate that international partners stand ready to accompany them on their path. Because we’re all aware of the strategic importance that the situation in Libya has with an eye to Africa, but also with an eye to the relationship between Africa and Europe.</p>
<p>We will have the opportunity for a brief exchange of views and we will undoubtedly touch upon the transatlantic agenda, the individual issues there. I had the opportunity of meeting the newly elected American President Joe Biden at the G7 Summit meeting in Cornwall and then afterwards at the NATO Summit meeting in Brussels. I would say that we’ve been able to find a common basis on which to tackle the geostrategic challenges of the world, not only identify them but actually to agree on a common approach towards these problems. This is true with an eye to Russia, with an eye to China, but it is equally true with an eye to the possible alliances we might form that represent our interests, and we will continue that exchange.</p>
<p>There’s also been a bilateral exchange of views between President Biden and the Russian President Mr. Putin, and I strongly welcome the fact that such a meeting has taken place. He has also met with the Chinese leadership – in Alaska, that is. Given all the controversies in the world, I think it is fair to say that we need to keep open channels for dialogue in which we can explain our positions and our approaches and then seek possible corridors towards solving these problems.</p>
<p>Again, thank you very much for coming to pay a visit. We look back on a very long history of good American-German relations and we are delighted that the American states, in order to quote the American President Joe Biden, are back again on the international, multilateral scene. Germany and America are partners in that regard, we are aware of the responsibility we bear, and I look forward to the exchange of views today.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Chancellor Merkel, thank you very much. Thank you for receiving me. Thank you for taking the time. But thank you especially for your remarkable leadership. I think it’s fair to say that the United States has no better partner, no better friend in the world than Germany. And it starts with, of course, shared values and shared interests but also, I think something the chancellor has expressed, a shared conviction that of all of the challenges that we face and that have an impact on the lives of our people, we know and we agree that no one country can address them alone.</p>
<p>There is a premium, maybe more than ever before, on cooperation, on coordination, on working with others, and Germany has set the example in doing just that. Whether it’s on COVID-19, climate change, the disruptive impact of new technologies, across the board the things that are really having an impact on the lives of our people, Germany and the United States share a conviction that we have to find ways to work together and work with others. And President Biden has focused these first six months of his presidency on reinvigorating our alliances on a bilateral basis, reinvigorating our engagement in multilateral institutions. And across the board, Germany has been our strong partner.</p>
<p>I think we also agree that we have a responsibility, particularly in this moment, to demonstrate that democracies can deliver – deliver in the lives of our people, deliver for people around the world. And there again, the example that the chancellor has set, that Germany has set could not be stronger, and today is a very good example of that with the work that Germany has done on Libya and the hope of this moment to actually see Libya hopefully take a course of security, freedom, independence, backed by the international community.</p>
<p>There is indeed a lot to talk about from China to Russia to many other issues in between, but for today, Chancellor, let me just simply say again, thank you, and also to tell you again how much President Biden looks forward to seeing you in Washington next month.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>CHANCELLOR MERKEL:</strong> Okay, <em>danke schoen</em>.</p>

<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good afternoon, everyone.  It’s very, very good to be here in Berlin, especially good to be here because we have an important conference bringing together international and Libyan partners in, I think, a moment of opportunity to reinforce the support of the international community for Libya as it moves forward toward elections, sustaining the ceasefire, getting foreign forces out of the country, and continuing the support of the international community.</p>
<p>So we want to take advantage of this moment of opportunity with great thanks to Germany for bringing everyone together, for the work that it’s done continuously to try to help Libya move toward a better and stronger and independent future.</p>
<p>So a lot of good work to be done today.  Great thanks to our hosts here in Germany for making this possible.  Thank you.  Thanks.</p>
