					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State has suspended operations at our Embassy in Minsk, Belarus and authorized the voluntary departure (“authorized departure”) of non-emergency employees and family members at our Embassy in Moscow, Russia. We took these steps due to security and safety issues stemming from the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces in Ukraine.  The Department of State continually adjusts its posture at embassies and consulates throughout the world in line with its mission, the local security environment, and the health situation. We ultimately have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens, and that includes our U.S. government personnel and their dependents serving around the world.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The report today from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a reminder that the climate crisis threatens us all, in every region of the world and across every sector of the economy.  It also demonstrates why the international community must urgently continue to pursue ambitious climate action, even as we face other pressing global challenges.</p>
<p>We know the significant risks climate change poses to our health and safety, and we know the climate plays a decisive role in shaping the trajectory of peace and prosperity in the world.  While political and economic decisions are the primary drivers of conflict, climate change will increase as a threat to global and local stability.</p>
<p>The IPCC report underscores the ways climate impacts are affecting lives and livelihoods globally now.  The report reflects scientists’ increased confidence that the harm already being experienced as a result of climate impacts will worsen as the world continues to warm, with growing adverse effects on economies, ecosystems, and human health.</p>
<p>Importantly, the IPCC report concludes that effective adaptation measures can help build a more resilient global society in the near term and beyond. The report also emphasizes that solutions are most effective when they prioritize inclusion and equity in planning and implementation and work across all levels of government.</p>
<p>The IPCC’s findings reinforce the importance and urgency of work already underway across the U.S. government to implement President Biden’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE), the cornerstone of the U.S. government response to addressing the increasing impacts of the global climate crisis.  PREPARE will bring together the United States’ diplomatic, development, and technical expertise to help more than half a billion people in developing countries adapt to and manage the impacts of climate change by 2030.</p>
<p>Approval of this report is the result of more than five years of work by hundreds of scientists from the United States and around the world to comprehensively assess what is known about the global impacts of and vulnerabilities to climate change.  I commend the many expert contributors to this report, which has provided us with a comprehensive and authoritative synthesis of knowledge about global climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation.</p>
<p>The United States is committed to continued participation in IPCC activities and to the rigorous use of scientific information as a foundation for action to address the threats from climate change.</p>

<p>The following is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>On February 26, Special Representative for the DPRK Sung Kim held calls to discuss the DPRK’s February 26 ballistic missile launch with Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director General for Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau Funakoshi Takehiro and ROK Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs Noh Kyu-duk.</p>
<p>Special Representative Kim condemned the launch, which violated multiple UN Security Council resolutions and presented a serious threat to regional stability.  Special Representative Kim underscored the United States’ continued commitment to close trilateral coordination with our Japanese and ROK allies and readiness to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy with the DPRK.  He reaffirmed the shared goal of complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of the ROK and Japan.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>I spoke this morning with Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi and our G-7 counterparts, and, together, we reaffirmed that we have never been more fully aligned across the globe to defend and preserve the freedom and sovereignty of Ukraine and all states.  We stand resolutely together against Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack.  Japan’s announcement today of comprehensive financial sanctions to isolate Russia from the international financial system demonstrates the unity and resolve of the United States, Japan, and other G-7 partners to stop Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.  These actions will deny selected Russian banks access to the global SWIFT financial messaging system, impose restrictions on the Bank of Russia, and sanction key Russian leaders, including President Putin.  The strong and decisive steps of Prime Minister Kishida and the Government of Japan, together with those of other allies and partners, will impose massive costs on Russia and thwart its ability to wage its war of choice on Ukraine.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today marks seven years since Boris Nemtsov, the former Russian Deputy Prime Minister, anti-corruption activist and physicist, was assassinated just blocks from the Kremlin.  Through his time in public service and by his civic activism, Nemtsov sought to make his country a better place by exposing corruption and advocating for political and economic reforms, for which he paid the ultimate price.  Among Nemtsov’s final projects before he was killed in 2015 was a report exposing Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine, which President Vladimir Putin had denied.  Though police ransacked Nemtsov’s apartment and confiscated his writings after his murder, they could not erase his legacy.  We glimpse Boris Nemtsov’s spirit in the courageous citizens of Russia who have publicly condemned the Kremlin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, including petitions signed by hundreds of journalists and municipal leaders condemning the invasion and the thousands of peaceful anti-war protestors detained by Russian authorities in recent days.  As the Kremlin attempts to spread disinformation and suppress dissent, we deeply respect those in Russia who follow Boris Nemtsov’s example and bravely speak up for what is right.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Our partnership with the people of Ukraine is steadfast and enduring, and we are focused on Ukraine&#8217;s urgent humanitarian needs as an important part of our response to Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack.  It is with the welfare of ordinary Ukrainians in mind that we are announcing the provision of nearly $54 million in humanitarian assistance to those affected by Russia’s further invasion.  This funding includes nearly $26 million from the Department of State and $28 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development.</p>
<p>The United States is one of the largest humanitarian donors to Ukraine, and our humanitarian assistance now amounts to nearly $405 million to vulnerable communities since Russia invaded Ukraine eight years ago.  This latest tranche of humanitarian assistance will flow through independent humanitarian organizations that deliver needs-based assistance with impartiality, humanity, neutrality, and independence.</p>
<p>This additional assistance will enable international humanitarian organizations to further support the people of Ukraine, working closely with the Government of Ukraine and European allies and partners at the forefront of any response.  This includes the provision of food, safe drinking water, shelter, emergency health care, winterization, and protection. Our funding will also help humanitarian organizations maintain contact between family members who have been separated due to the conflict, hopefully leading to reunification in some cases.</p>
<p>The United States commends the hospitality of the neighboring countries in the region hosting fleeing Ukrainians, and we are engaging diplomatically to support their efforts to keep their borders open and assist those seeking international protection.  As with any refugee situation, we call on the international community to respond to the needs of those seeking protection in a way consistent with the principle of non-refoulement and our shared obligations under international law.  We welcome the contributions of other donors toward this crisis response and urge still others to generously support the immediate humanitarian needs in Ukraine and the region.</p>

<p>The United States is one of the largest humanitarian donors to Ukraine, and our humanitarian assistance now amounts to nearly $405 million to vulnerable communities since Russia invaded Ukraine eight years ago.  This latest tranche of humanitarian assistance will flow through independent humanitarian organizations that deliver needs-based assistance with impartiality, humanity, neutrality, and independence.</p>
<p>This additional assistance will enable international humanitarian organizations to further support the people of Ukraine, working closely with the Government of Ukraine and European allies and partners at the forefront of any response.  This includes the provision of food, safe drinking water, shelter, emergency health care, winterization, and protection. Our funding will also help humanitarian organizations maintain contact between family members who have been separated due to the conflict, hopefully leading to reunification in some cases.</p>
<p>The United States commends the hospitality of the neighboring countries in the region hosting fleeing Ukrainians, and we are engaging diplomatically to support their efforts to keep their borders open and assist those seeking international protection.  As with any refugee situation, we call on the international community to respond to the needs of those seeking protection in a way consistent with the principle of non-refoulement and our shared obligations under international law.  We welcome the contributions of other donors toward this crisis response and urge still others to generously support the immediate humanitarian needs in Ukraine and the region.</p>
