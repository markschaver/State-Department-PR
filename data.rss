					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the American people, I join the citizens of the European Union in celebrating Europe Day.</p>
<p>On this day, 72 years ago, French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman put forward the idea for what would eventually become the European Union.  His vision became real 30 years ago with the signature of the Treaty on European Union in Maastricht.  Schuman’s animating principle was that closer cooperation and creative thinking could bring about lasting peace in Europe and around the world.  That same spirit continues to inspire cooperation both within the EU and across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The U.S.-EU partnership has grown deeper and stronger in the decades since, expanding to encompass the full range of regional and global challenges that we face together.  Alongside our EU partners and friends, we have brought to life the prospect of cooperation and creativity that Schuman and so many leaders on both sides of the Atlantic envisioned.</p>
<p>Today’s U.S.-EU relationship is a forward-looking partnership that seeks not only to respond to the crises we face but also to build the opportunities of the future.  From working to end the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to tackling the climate crisis, from strengthening our cooperation on technology and the digital economy to advocating for human rights and democracy within our own borders and worldwide, the United States and EU are working together more closely than ever to make the world a safer and more resilient place where all people can live in dignity and freedom.</p>
<p>The Russian government’s brutal and unjustified war against Ukraine has made clearer than ever the urgency of promoting and defending the values and ideals that the EU and the U.S.-EU relationship represent.  It has also demonstrated how the dream of a Europe whole, free, and at peace continues to motivate those in Europe and beyond working for a more secure, more just, and more prosperous world.</p>
<p>Today, on Europe Day, I extend my congratulations and warm wishes to the European Union’s citizens, member states, and institutions.</p>

<p>Highlighting the deepening ties of friendship between the United States and Qatar, the Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), the U.S. Mission in Doha, and other U.S. and local officials broke ground today for a new U.S. Embassy in Qatar’s capital city.</p>
<p>Located on a 12.3-acre site in a new diplomatic zone in Doha’s Wadi al Banat district, the new U.S. Embassy will support the continued expansion of U.S.–Qatari diplomatic, security, and commercial relations.</p>
<p>Richärd Kennedy Architects of Phoenix, Arizona, is the design architect, American International Contractors Inc. (Special Projects), of McLean, Virginia, is the Design/Build contractor, and KCCT of Washington is the Architect of Record.  An estimated $110 million will be invested in the local economy and approximately 1,200 third-country nationals will be employed during construction.  The new U.S. Embassy is scheduled for completion in 2026 and will provide a future-forward, resilient platform for diplomacy in Doha.</p>
<p>Since the start of the Department’s Capital Security Construction Program in 1999, OBO has completed 171 new diplomatic facilities.  OBO currently has more than 50 active projects in the design phase or under construction worldwide.</p>
<p>OBO provides safe, secure, functional, and resilient facilities that represent the U.S. government to the host nation and that support U.S. diplomats in advancing U.S. foreign policy objectives abroad.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Eighty years ago, the United States and Australia formed an unprecedented partnership just months after the attack on Pearl Harbor and the bombings of Darwin and Broome.  This partnership has endured and strengthened as our nations have commemorated the 80th Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea.</p>
<p>Our countries joined forces and our service members fought side-by-side for four days in what would become a turning point in the war in the Pacific.  Our nations are forever grateful for the heroism demonstrated by those courageous Americans and Australians.  We will always remember the sacrifice they made for the cause of freedom in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The battle paved the way for an alliance that today is a foundational underpinning to the stability of the region and for democracy in the Indo-Pacific. We remain committed to our shared values and a shared vision for the region for the years to come.</p>
<p>Whether we are combating the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening our economies, or advancing peace and prosperity, the United States and Australia continue to be steadfast allies for each other and the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

<p>Our countries joined forces and our service members fought side-by-side for four days in what would become a turning point in the war in the Pacific.  Our nations are forever grateful for the heroism demonstrated by those courageous Americans and Australians.  We will always remember the sacrifice they made for the cause of freedom in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The battle paved the way for an alliance that today is a foundational underpinning to the stability of the region and for democracy in the Indo-Pacific. We remain committed to our shared values and a shared vision for the region for the years to come.</p>
<p>Whether we are combating the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening our economies, or advancing peace and prosperity, the United States and Australia continue to be steadfast allies for each other and the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The text of the following statement was released by the G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union.</p>
<p><i>Begin Text:</i></p>
<p>We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, underscore our grave concern over the selection process for the Chief Executive in Hong Kong as part of a continued assault on political pluralism and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p>Last year, PRC and Hong Kong authorities moved away from the ultimate aim of universal suffrage as set out in Hong Kong’s Basic Law by increasing the number of non-elected members appointed to the Election Committee and dramatically curtailing the number of voters eligible to participate in the Committee elections.</p>
<p>The current nomination process and resulting appointment are a stark departure from the aim of universal suffrage and further erode the ability of Hong Kongers to be legitimately represented. We are deeply concerned about this steady erosion of political and civil rights and Hong Kong’s autonomy. We continue to call on China to act in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and its other legal obligations.  We urge the new Chief Executive to respect protected rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, as provided for in the Basic Law, and ensure the court system upholds the rule of law.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>As President Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war enters its fourth month, the United States recognizes the staggering human toll of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.  Civilian casualties continue to mount, as do widespread reports of war crimes and other atrocities perpetrated by Russia’s forces in Ukraine.  As the people of Ukraine continue to fight bravely against Russia’s brutality, we will continue imposing severe costs to hold President Putin accountable for his utter disregard for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We also will hold to account those involved in his war of choice, including those suspected of taking part in atrocities and human rights abuses against civilians.</p>
<p>Today, the United States, in coordination with our allies and partners, is taking further actions to increase the pressure on the Russian Federation by designating the executives and board members of two of Russia’s most important banks, Sberbank and Gazprombank; a Russian state-owned bank, Moscow Industrial Bank, and 10 of its subsidiaries; and a state-supported weapons manufacturer, Promtekhnologiya.</p>
<p>Further, following our recent port ban, we continue to target Russia’s maritime defense logistics capabilities by designating the Ministry of Defense’s shipping company and six other maritime shipping companies that transport weapons and other military equipment for the Government of Russia, while identifying 69 of their vessels as blocked property.  Additionally, we are designating Fertoing, a specialized marine engineering company that produces remotely operated subsea equipment, among other activities.  Fertoing will now be blocked from accessing critical U.S. technologies.</p>
<p>In addition, the Treasury Department is designating Russia-1, Channel One, and NTV, all of which are directly or indirectly state-owned and controlled media within Russia, spreading disinformation to bolster Putin’s war.  These television stations have been among the largest recipients of foreign revenue, which feeds back to the Russian state.  The United States remains a steadfast champion for media freedom.</p>
<p>We are also taking steps today to impose visa restrictions on over 2,600 Russian and Belarusian military officials who are believed to have been involved in actions that threaten or violate the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of Ukraine.  Included among this group are personnel who reportedly took part in Russian military activities in Bucha, the horrors of which have shocked the world.  We are further announcing a new visa restriction policy targeting Russian Federation military officials and Russian-backed or Russian-installed purported authorities who are believed to have been involved in human rights abuses, violations of international humanitarian law, or public corruption in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In addition to holding the Lukashenka regime accountable for its complicity in enabling the Kremlin’s war, we continue to promote accountability for those involved in the decades-long violent repression of the political opposition in Belarus.  In that context, the State Department has designated three Belarusian officials, Dzmitry Paulichenka, Yury Sivakov, and Viktar Sheiman, pursuant to Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act for their involvement in gross violation of human rights, namely the enforced disappearance of at least one of Lukashenka’s political opponents in 1999.  Under this authority, immediate family members are also ineligible for entry to the United States, to include Viktar Sheiman’s wife, Elena Sheiman, and his adult son, Sergei Sheiman.</p>
<p>Finally, the United States is cutting off Russia’s access to certain key services from U.S. companies that the Russian Federation and Russian elites use to hide their wealth and evade sanctions.  We are prohibiting U.S. persons, wherever located, from providing accounting, trust and corporate formation, and management consulting services to any person located in the Russian Federation, under Executive Order (E. O.) 14071.  We are also identifying the accounting, trust and corporate formation services, and management consulting sectors of the Russian economy pursuant to E.O. 14024, which will allow the United States to target any person who operates or has operated in these sectors of the Russian Federation economy.</p>
<p>Our actions today complement previous steps we have taken with our allies and partners since the beginning of Russia’s unconscionable war.  As long as the Russian Federation continues its aggression against Ukraine, the United States will continue implementing new economic measures against Russia, in particular against its institutions and elites enabling the destruction of entire cities and the killing of thousands of civilians in Ukraine.</p>
