					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Today, the United States is launching a plan to address the root causes of irregular migration from Central America and to manage migration humanely throughout North and Central America.  As President Biden announced shortly after taking office, the United States is committed to a multi-year, $4 billion, comprehensive, regional strategy to improve people’s lives throughout the region.  We are partnering with civil society, the private sector, labor unions, governments in the region, and international partners to carry out an effective strategy that achieves results.  To address the root causes of irregular migration we are focusing our efforts on five areas:</p>
<p>(1) Address economic insecurity and inequality,</p>
<p>(2) Combat corruption, strengthen democratic governance, and advance the rule of law,</p>
<p>(3) Promote respect for human rights, labor rights, and a free press,</p>
<p>(4) Counter and prevent violence, extortion, and other crimes perpetrated by criminal gangs, trafficking networks, and other organized criminal organizations,</p>
<p>(5) Combat sexual, gender-based, and domestic violence.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government’s complete Root Causes Strategy is available here: <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Root-Causes-Strategy.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Root-Causes-Strategy.pdf</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a></p>
<p>We are also pursuing a comprehensive approach to humanely manage migration and strengthen asylum processes throughout North and Central America.  This collaborative focus will encourage greater responsibility sharing among regional governments and a broader range of international donors.  It will also expand access to legal pathways to protection, family reunification, and temporary labor opportunities.  The Collaborative Migration Management Strategy is the first U.S. government strategy to focus on strengthening cooperative efforts across North and Central America to humanely manage migration.</p>
<p>In working collaboratively with governments in the region, cooperation is centered on eight lines of action:</p>
<p>(1) Stabilize populations facing acute needs,</p>
<p>(2) Expand access to international protection,</p>
<p>(3) Expand access to protection in home countries,</p>
<p>(4) Expand access to temporary labor programs in the region while improving worker protections,</p>
<p>(5) Assist and reintegrate returned persons,</p>
<p>(6) Foster secure and humane border management,</p>
<p>(7) Strengthen regional public messaging on migration, and</p>
<p>(8) Support lawful pathways for protection and opportunity in the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government’s complete Collaborative Migration Management Strategy is available here: <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Collaborative-Migration-Management-Strategy.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Collaborative-Migration-Management-Strategy.pdf</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a></p>
<p>Our objective is to support people in Central America in their efforts to advance economically; live, work, and learn in safety and dignity; contribute to and benefit from the democratic process; reduce inequality; and create the futures they desire for themselves and their families.  The success of these initiatives will strengthen U.S. national security and promote a more prosperous, democratic, and secure region.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p class="p1">Today marks 50 years since the Turkish Constitutional Court ruled that all institutions of higher education must either nationalize or close, resulting in the closure of the Theological School of Halki, a seminary of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the Eastern Orthodox Church.  The Halki Seminary had operated for 127 years, and its closing deprived the Ecumenical Patriarchate of a training school for Orthodox clergy in Turkey, its home for 1,690 years.  Since Halki’s closure, those wishing to become Orthodox clergy have been forced to go abroad for their training.</p>
<p class="p1">The United States continues to urge the Turkish government to respect the right to freedom of religion or belief as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and allow the reopening of the Halki Seminary.  Moreover, we call upon the government of Turkey to allow all religious groups to again train their clergy within the country.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New Delhi, India</p>
<p>The Leela Palace Hotel</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Welcome to <em>The</em> <em>Times of India</em>, and &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So let’s just start off right.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So what has – what have we achieved in the Quad so far?  And where do you think it’s (inaudible)?  You’ve got a summit coming up.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, first we had the first ever leaders-level meeting of the Quad.  That was in and of itself very significant, because it just underscored the importance that the four countries – India, the United States, Japan, and Australia – attach to the Quad.  And what we’ve achieved already is bringing together four likeminded democracies in common purpose to deal with some of the most important problems and challenges facing our countries, and in fact facing the region and even the world, starting with COVID-19, and a commitment to work together to finance, to produce, to distribute millions of vaccines.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Are you satisfied with the progress on the vaccine?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Yeah, I think we’re making – we’re making progress on that.  I think the – when the leaders get together next, they’ll be able to assess that progress.  Of course, COVID-19 remains a huge challenge for all of us, and since the first virtual leaders meeting, the second wave hit India.  I’m proud that the United States was able to come to India’s assistance, as India came to our assistance early during the pandemic when we had real challenges.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We’ve seen reports of a digital services tax that had been proposed by the U.S.  Is there something &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I’m sorry, digital services?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  A digital services agreement between countries – likeminded countries, I guess.  Is there something that you &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We’re – there – we’re doing work in a wide variety of areas, to include not just COVID-19, but working together on the climate crisis, working together on infrastructure, on maritime security, on – and on emerging technologies.  And that includes in the digital space.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And if you would tell us, for Indian readers, because we are – we know the China challenge.  We’ve shed blood.  What – how would you describe the challenge of China to the world, to West and India &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  For the United States, in a way as for India, it’s both one of the most consequential and most complicated relationships that we have.  I think we’ve seen China – unfortunately, the government in Beijing act more repressively at home and more aggressively abroad in recent years.  That poses a challenge for all of us.  As we look at it, we see a relationship that is in parts adversarial, in parts competitive, and also in parts cooperative.  And I think what we’ve found is that whether it’s adversarial, whether it’s competitive, whether it’s cooperative, the most effective way to engage China is working with other countries that are similarly situated and that face similar challenges.  India, of course, is a strong partner for the United States.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Do you think the era of cooperation with China may be over?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  No.  As I said, I think the relationship has different elements in it.  Cooperation remains one of them because on some issues, it’s profoundly in our mutual interest to cooperate, and irrespective of the competition, irrespective of the adversarial nature of parts of the relationship, that’s – those interests remain.  Climate may be the best example.  That’s an issue that is important to all of us.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  With the troops withdrawal – U.S. troops withdrawal from Afghanistan, I have two questions.  One is:  Do you think it affects the U.S. credibility as a partner?  Second, as a woman, I have to ask this:  For 20 years, women have had a good run in Afghanistan.  Do you think we’re sort of feeding them to the wolves, so to speak?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Two things.  As you just said, 20 years.  It’s been 20 years.  We have to remember why we went to Afghanistan in the first place.  It’s because we were attacked on 9/11.  We went to do justice for – to those who attacked us and to try to make sure that it couldn’t happen again.  And we’ve largely succeeded in that effort.  Usama bin Ladin was brought to justice 10 years ago.  And al-Qaida, the organization that attacked us, in terms of its capacity to do that again from Afghanistan, that’s been vastly diminished.</p>
<p>It’s now 20 years later, a trillion dollars later, more than 4,500 American soldiers lost their lives later.  Afghanistan ultimately has to be able to shape its own future, but with our support.  Even as we withdraw our forces, we are staying very much engaged in Afghanistan with a strong embassy, with programs to support women and girls, economic development, humanitarian assistance, and the security forces.  So we’re remaining very much engaged – also with our diplomacy, because the only resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan is at the negotiating table, not at the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Pakistan continues to support the Taliban.  And are we seeing the same effect in Afghanistan today that we saw for the last 20 years?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Pakistan has a vital role to play in using its influence with the Taliban to do whatever it can to make sure that the Taliban does not seek to take the country by force.  And it does have influence, and it does have a role to play, and we hope that it plays it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  What are your priority items with India?  And when do we expect a presidential visit to India?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, I can’t put a date on it, but I know that President Biden very much looks forward to visiting India, and similarly to having Prime Minister Modi in the United States.  But no date yet, but I’m sure that that will come.</p>
<p>Look, in terms of priorities, the relationship is both so wide and so deep there are – as we discussed today through several hours with Foreign Minister Jaishankar – a multiplicity of places where we’re working together.  But I would say, again, we’re obviously focused on COVID together.  We’re focused on climate together.  We’re focused on the role of emerging technologies together.  But we’re also focused on strengthening our trade and investment relationship, bringing our scientists and technologists and innovators together, strengthening people-to-people ties.  We look forward to welcoming nearly 70,000 Indian students to the United States for this next semester.</p>
<p>So it’s incredibly broad, and what we’ve seen over the last 20 years, 25 years through different administrations in both countries is a relationship that’s only gotten stronger and deeper.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Squeezing in one last &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Very short.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  The – India will probably take delivery of the S-400 from Russia later this year.  How will that impact, given what the Congress – CAATSA act?  What – how would that impact U.S.-India relations?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, we have – we have our laws.  We’ll – we apply our laws, but we shared our concerns with India about this.  But I’m not going to get ahead of myself.  We’ll see how things evolve in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you so much, Secretary.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I’m sorry, digital services?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  A digital services agreement between countries – likeminded countries, I guess.  Is there something that you &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We’re – there – we’re doing work in a wide variety of areas, to include not just COVID-19, but working together on the climate crisis, working together on infrastructure, on maritime security, on – and on emerging technologies.  And that includes in the digital space.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And if you would tell us, for Indian readers, because we are – we know the China challenge.  We’ve shed blood.  What – how would you describe the challenge of China to the world, to West and India &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  For the United States, in a way as for India, it’s both one of the most consequential and most complicated relationships that we have.  I think we’ve seen China – unfortunately, the government in Beijing act more repressively at home and more aggressively abroad in recent years.  That poses a challenge for all of us.  As we look at it, we see a relationship that is in parts adversarial, in parts competitive, and also in parts cooperative.  And I think what we’ve found is that whether it’s adversarial, whether it’s competitive, whether it’s cooperative, the most effective way to engage China is working with other countries that are similarly situated and that face similar challenges.  India, of course, is a strong partner for the United States.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Do you think the era of cooperation with China may be over?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  No.  As I said, I think the relationship has different elements in it.  Cooperation remains one of them because on some issues, it’s profoundly in our mutual interest to cooperate, and irrespective of the competition, irrespective of the adversarial nature of parts of the relationship, that’s – those interests remain.  Climate may be the best example.  That’s an issue that is important to all of us.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  With the troops withdrawal – U.S. troops withdrawal from Afghanistan, I have two questions.  One is:  Do you think it affects the U.S. credibility as a partner?  Second, as a woman, I have to ask this:  For 20 years, women have had a good run in Afghanistan.  Do you think we’re sort of feeding them to the wolves, so to speak?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Two things.  As you just said, 20 years.  It’s been 20 years.  We have to remember why we went to Afghanistan in the first place.  It’s because we were attacked on 9/11.  We went to do justice for – to those who attacked us and to try to make sure that it couldn’t happen again.  And we’ve largely succeeded in that effort.  Usama bin Ladin was brought to justice 10 years ago.  And al-Qaida, the organization that attacked us, in terms of its capacity to do that again from Afghanistan, that’s been vastly diminished.</p>
<p>It’s now 20 years later, a trillion dollars later, more than 4,500 American soldiers lost their lives later.  Afghanistan ultimately has to be able to shape its own future, but with our support.  Even as we withdraw our forces, we are staying very much engaged in Afghanistan with a strong embassy, with programs to support women and girls, economic development, humanitarian assistance, and the security forces.  So we’re remaining very much engaged – also with our diplomacy, because the only resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan is at the negotiating table, not at the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Pakistan continues to support the Taliban.  And are we seeing the same effect in Afghanistan today that we saw for the last 20 years?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Pakistan has a vital role to play in using its influence with the Taliban to do whatever it can to make sure that the Taliban does not seek to take the country by force.  And it does have influence, and it does have a role to play, and we hope that it plays it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  What are your priority items with India?  And when do we expect a presidential visit to India?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, I can’t put a date on it, but I know that President Biden very much looks forward to visiting India, and similarly to having Prime Minister Modi in the United States.  But no date yet, but I’m sure that that will come.</p>
<p>Look, in terms of priorities, the relationship is both so wide and so deep there are – as we discussed today through several hours with Foreign Minister Jaishankar – a multiplicity of places where we’re working together.  But I would say, again, we’re obviously focused on COVID together.  We’re focused on climate together.  We’re focused on the role of emerging technologies together.  But we’re also focused on strengthening our trade and investment relationship, bringing our scientists and technologists and innovators together, strengthening people-to-people ties.  We look forward to welcoming nearly 70,000 Indian students to the United States for this next semester.</p>
<p>So it’s incredibly broad, and what we’ve seen over the last 20 years, 25 years through different administrations in both countries is a relationship that’s only gotten stronger and deeper.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Squeezing in one last &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Very short.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  The – India will probably take delivery of the S-400 from Russia later this year.  How will that impact, given what the Congress – CAATSA act?  What – how would that impact U.S.-India relations?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, we have – we have our laws.  We’ll – we apply our laws, but we shared our concerns with India about this.  But I’m not going to get ahead of myself.  We’ll see how things evolve in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you so much, Secretary.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>

<p>The United States condemns the recent escalation of violence along the international border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  We call on Armenia and Azerbaijan to uphold their ceasefire commitments by taking immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.</p>
<p>Continued tensions along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border underscore the fact that only a comprehensive resolution that addresses all outstanding issues can normalize relations between the two countries and allow the people of the region to live together peacefully.  The United States urges Armenia and Azerbaijan to return as soon as possible to substantive discussions under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs to achieve a long-term political settlement to the conflict.</p>

<p>Protests in Iran that began with a water shortage &#8212; owing to drought and governmental mismanagement and neglect &#8212; in the Khuzestan province have now spread across various cities including Tehran, Karaj and Tabriz.  The Iranian people are now putting a spotlight not only on their unmet needs, but also their unfulfilled aspirations for respect for human rights &#8212; rights to which individuals the world over are entitled.</p>
<p>The Iranian people have a right to voice their frustrations and hold their government accountable, but we have seen disturbing reports that security forces fired on protesters, resulting in multiple deaths.  We condemn the use of violence against peaceful protestors.  We support the rights of Iranians to peacefully assemble and express themselves, without fear of violence and detention by security forces.  We are also monitoring reports of internet slowdowns in the region.</p>
