					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The following is the joint statement released by the Secretary of State of the United States and the Foreign Ministers of the Governments of Australia, India, and Japan.</p>
<p><em>Begin Text</em>.</p>
<p>We, the Foreign Ministers of Australia, India and Japan and the Secretary of State of the United States met in Melbourne, Australia on 11 February 2022, for the fourth Quad Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. In meeting, we reaffirm the Quad’s commitment to supporting Indo Pacific countries’ efforts to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific – a region which is inclusive and resilient, and in which states strive to protect the interests of their people, free from coercion.</p>
<p>Our meeting advanced the Quad’s positive and ambitious agenda. We are focused on working closely with Indo-Pacific partners to address the region’s most important challenges. Working together as the Quad, we are more effective in delivering practical support to the region.</p>
<p>As unwavering supporters of ASEAN unity and centrality, and the ASEAN-led architecture, we continue to support ASEAN partners to advance the practical implementation of ASEAN’s Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. The Outlook’s principles are fundamental to regional stability and prosperity and will be key to guiding the region’s economic and political future. We acknowledge the importance of sub-regional mechanisms and institutions, including in the Mekong sub-region. We will continue to support Cambodia in its important role as 2022 ASEAN Chair.</p>
<p>As we enter the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Quad partners have collectively provided more than 500 million vaccine doses. Together, we have pledged to donate more than 1.3 billion vaccine doses globally. We are pleased with the Quad Vaccine Partnership’s rapid progress in expanding vaccine production at the Biological E Ltd facility in India, which aims to deliver at least 1 billion vaccines by the end of 2022. We look forward to the delivery of the first batch of Quad-supported vaccines in the first half of this year. We are assisting to train healthcare workers, combat vaccine hesitancy and augment infrastructure, especially cold chain systems, for ‘last mile’ vaccine delivery. We are working to identify and address vaccine gaps and barriers exacerbated by gender, disability and social inequities, and ensure safe, effective, affordable and quality-assured vaccination coverage in hard-to-reach areas. We welcome the timely initiative for coordinating the response to combat the COVID pandemic under a Global Action Plan for Enhanced Engagement.</p>
<p>We welcome progress on the practical cooperation we lead as Quad Foreign Ministers to address regional challenges, including humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR), maritime security, counter-terrorism, countering disinformation and cyber security.</p>
<p>We are strengthening HADR cooperation in the region. Since 2004, when we collaborated in response to the Indian Ocean tsunami, Quad partners have continued to respond quickly and effectively to natural disasters in the Indo-Pacific. We recognise that recent natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the need to build and maintain resilience against such events, and are proud to be supporting our Tongan partners in their response and recovery efforts following the January 2022 volcano eruption and tsunami. We commit to further strengthening our collaboration and building links between our response agencies to provide timely and effective HADR support to the region.</p>
<p>The Quad recognises that international law, peace, and security in the maritime domain underpins the development and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific. We reiterate the importance of adherence to international law, particularly as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to meet challenges to the maritime rules-based order, including in the South and East China Seas. We are determined to deepen engagement with regional partners, including through capacity-building and technical assistance, to strengthen maritime domain awareness; protect their ability to develop offshore resources, consistent with UNCLOS; ensure freedom of navigation and overflight; combat challenges, such as illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; and promote the safety and security of sea lines of communication.</p>
<p>The Quad is exchanging information on ever-evolving threats and working with Indo-Pacific countries, and in multilateral fora, to counter all forms of terrorism and violent extremism. We denounce the use of terrorist proxies for cross-border terrorism and urge countries to work together to eliminate terrorist safe havens; disrupt terrorist networks and the infrastructure and financial channels which sustain them; and halt cross-border movement of terrorists. In this context, we call on all countries to ensure that territory under their control is not used to launch terror attacks and to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of such attacks. We reiterate our condemnation of terrorist attacks in India, including 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot attacks. We reaffirm <em>UNSC Resolution 2593 (2021) </em>that Afghan territory should not be used to threaten or attack any country, shelter or train terrorists, or plan or finance terrorist acts, with such ungoverned spaces being a direct threat to the safety and security of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>The Quad is supporting regional neighbours to build resilience and counter disinformation. We will also coordinate efforts to assist partners across the Indo-Pacific to address the growing threat of ransomware, by strengthening capacity building to ensure resilient cyber security and to counter cybercrime. We are committed to promoting international peace and stability in cyberspace, and to helping build the capacity of regional countries to implement the UN Voluntary Framework for Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace.</p>
<p>Quad partners champion the free, open, and inclusive rules-based order, rooted in international law, that protects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of regional countries. We reaffirm our commitment to upholding and strengthening the rules-based multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization at its core. We oppose coercive economic policies and practices that run counter to this system and will work collectively to foster global economic resilience against such actions.</p>
<p>We express our commitment to strengthen our diplomatic efforts so that the vision for technologies, guided by the Quad Principles on Technology Design, Development, Governance, and Use, will be further shared by all like-minded nations.</p>
<p>Reflecting Quad leaders’ commitment to cooperate to establish responsible and resilient clean-energy supply chains, we welcome Australia’s proposal to host an Indo-Pacific Clean Energy Supply Chain Forum in mid-2022.</p>
<p>We reaffirm our belief that our people-to-people ties are among the Quad’s greatest strengths and welcomed the United States’ new exchange programs in the fields of cyber security, maritime security, countering disinformation, and promoting transparency in governance. We are exploring a track 1.5 dialogue between our respective strategic thinkers.</p>
<p>Alongside our Quad Foreign Ministers’ agenda, we welcome other ongoing work in delivering Quad Leaders’ ambitious initiatives in key areas, such as the Quad Vaccine Partnership, climate change, cyber security, infrastructure, and the peaceful use of outer space, education, and critical and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>We remain gravely concerned about the crisis in Myanmar and call for an end to violence, the release of all those arbitrarily detained, including foreigners, and unhindered humanitarian access. We reaffirm our support for ASEAN efforts to seek a solution in Myanmar and call on the military regime to urgently implement ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus and swiftly return Myanmar to the path of democracy. We encourage the international community to work together to support an end to the violence.</p>
<p>We condemn North Korea’s destabilising ballistic missile launches in violation of UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs), reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearisation of North Korea consistent with UNSCRs, and reconfirm the necessity of immediate resolution of the issue of Japanese abductees.</p>
<p>We look forward to Japan hosting the next Quad Leaders’ Summit in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>We will continue to meet annually to deliver as a force for good for the region.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Melbourne, Australia</p>
<p>Park Hyatt Hotel</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER PAYNE:</b>  Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Tony, it’s such a pleasure to be welcoming you here today.  Our COVID protocols (inaudible) those that are speaking can speak without their mask.  We will replace them once we’ve finished speaking.</p>
<p>It is a great pleasure to welcome you to Melbourne, but first of all let me acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we (inaudible) here this morning and pay my respects to the elders past, present, and emerging of the Wurundjeri people, and acknowledge their stewardship of this great land.</p>
<p>As I said, it’s a great pleasure to welcome you to Australia and also to Melbourne.  Only two of your predecessors have visited Melbourne before, as I understand it – Secretary Rice and Secretary Clinton.  So you follow in the footsteps of great women, and it is an absolute pleasure to have you here today.</p>
<p>A lot has changed not just in Melbourne since those secretaries both visited, of course.  And indeed, in 2022, I think we are facing challenges of a different scale than those which we have been dealing with over the preceding decades.  But as you have said and as you reiterated in some of your comments since your arrival, when allies and partners work together we are so much more efficient, we are so much more collaborative.  When we are committed to our shared values, there are no challenges we cannot and will not overcome.</p>
<p>Australia affirms that.  I affirm that and I look forward to discussing those matters with you today.  Our work together in the Indo-Pacific is growing exponentially, and it is very rewarding to see the engagement of so many of our partners in the region with us both, as well as COVID-19 recovery, which, of course, is a very significant priority.  We work to counter disinformation.  We are going to talk today, I am sure, about the threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine as well, outside our own region.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss our AUKUS partnership and the progress that we have made so far, and very much welcome the collaborative work the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia are doing on such an important undertaking, not just in relation to the delivery of a submarine, nuclear-powered submarine to Australia, but on those issues of artificial intelligence, of quantum computing, of cyber and other capabilities.</p>
<p>More than one authoritarian regime is presenting itself in the current world climate as a challenge – the DPRK, China as well – and that will be part of our discussions today.  We strongly support U.S. leadership on those challenges.  I want to commend you and your team particularly in terms of the extraordinary efforts you are making in relation to Russia and the destabilizing effect it is having on security and stability on the Ukraine border and more broadly.</p>
<p>I think I said in Washington, D.C. last year that our alliance mission was to work together in line with our values, to keep our people safe, and to preserve and enhance peace and stability.  Having you here together today affirms our commitment to that goal, and I very much look forward to working with you as you are going about your journey here in Australia.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Marise, colleagues, it’s wonderful to be with all of you today.  I want to thank you, first of all, for doing this here in Melbourne.  I was first here in 1980, so I got here actually probably a little bit before Secretary Rice and Secretary Clinton (inaudible).  (Laughter.)  But their footsteps are large to follow, but I’m glad for the opportunity to do that.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful day yesterday spending time at the University of Melbourne.  There’s a deep family connection there.  My stepfather is an alumnus, so that was wonderful to reconnect, also just to talk to some remarkable young Australians who are really the future of the relationship, the partnership between us – incredibly engaged, incredibly smart, incredibly thoughtful about the present and the future.  And also time on campus with companies – Australian, American – working on the challenge of the moment, COVID-19.  And the public-private partnerships that we’re building together even across a great distance are having a great impact.  So it was a wonderful way to start the day – the botanic gardens as well – and connecting to what really grounds us.  So I thank you for the opportunity to be here.</p>
<p>But to everything you said, I couldn’t agree more.  We have talked many times in the year or so that we’ve been working together.  We know that we are stronger and more effective working together to meet these challenges, whether it’s COVID, whether it’s climate, whether it’s emerging technologies, whether it’s the challenge posed by autocratic regimes to the order that we’ve worked so hard to establish together – indeed have been side by side for many, many years in doing that.  We know with respect to the United States that we simply can’t do it without partnerships, and Australia for us is right at the top of the list of partnerships that we’ve been working to strengthen, to invigorate, and to carry forward in all the ways that you said.</p>
<p>So we do indeed have a lot to cover today, both the immediate agenda, challenges posed far away from here but that have an impact on this region as well, but also all of the work that we’re doing together to ensure that we have a free and open Indo-Pacific for many, many years to come.  And I think the United States, Australia as partners, as mates, are essential to that goal, to that shared goal.  I’m glad to be here working today on that.  Thank you for having us.</p>

<p>The United States condemns the terrorist attack by the Houthis today that struck the commercial airport in Abha, Saudi Arabia, injuring at least a dozen innocent civilians.  We wish the victims a full recovery.  Repeated attacks of the last several weeks have harmed civilians and civilian infrastructure and undermine international efforts for a peaceful solution to the Yemen conflict and threaten the more than 70,000 U.S. citizens living in Saudi Arabia. The Houthis have pursued a dangerous pattern of increasingly obstructive and aggressive actions against Yemenis, Yemen’s neighbors, and the international community.  As President Biden reiterated in his call to King Salman yesterday, the United States is firmly committed to supporting the defense of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The United States, along with the international community, continues to urge de-escalation of the conflict.  The parties should come to the negotiating table to work together and support the new, more inclusive UN-led peace process.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Troika (Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America), Canada, Switzerland, and the European Union are alarmed by the February 9 arrests and detentions of several high-profile political figures.  These troubling actions are part of a recent pattern of arrests and detentions of civil society activists, journalists, and humanitarian workers occurring throughout Sudan these last weeks.  We condemn this harassment and intimidation on the part of Sudan’s military authorities.  This is wholly inconsistent with their stated commitment to participate constructively in a facilitated process to resolve Sudan’s political crisis to return to a democratic transition.</p>
<p>We call for an immediate end to such practices and for the immediate release of all those unjustly detained.  We remind Sudan’s military authorities of their obligations to respect the human rights and guarantee the safety of those detained or arrested and the need to ensure that due process is consistently followed in all cases.  The lifting of the state of emergency, declared at the time of the October 25 military takeover would send a positive signal.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Department of State welcomes the issuance today of a report by a committee of the International Labor Organization (ILO) calling on the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to review, repeal, and revise its laws and practices of employment discrimination against racial and religious minorities in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This report, produced by the ILO’s <wbr />Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, <wbr />expresses deep concern regarding the PRC’s policies and calls on <wbr />the PRC government to take specific steps toward eliminating <wbr />racial and religious discrimination in employment and occupation, and to amend <wbr />national and regional policies utilizing vocational training and rehabilitation centers for “political re-education&#8221; based on administrative detention.</p>
<p>China joined the ILO in 1919 as one of the founding member states. The United States calls on the PRC to take the steps requested by the Committee of Experts.  We also reiterate our call for the PRC to end its genocide and crimes against humanity perpetrated <wbr />against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, as well as its use of these groups for forced labor in Xinjiang and beyond. The State Department is committed to working with our international partners and allies to end forced labor and strengthen international action against the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The Committee’s report can be found here &#8211; <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_836653.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/&#8212;ed_norm/&#8212;relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_836653.pdf</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Department of State is pleased to announce that Matt Murray will be the new U.S. Senior Official for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Senior Official Murray brings a wealth of experience to this position as a career member of the Senior Foreign Service. Throughout his 23 years in the Foreign Service, he has served primarily in economic policy roles both in Washington and at diplomatic posts in the Asia-Pacific region.<b><u></u></b></p>
<p>Senior Official Murray most recently led the State Department’s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs as Senior Bureau Official following an assignment as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Trade Policy and Negotiations.  His service in the Asia-Pacific region includes leadership roles both as Minister Counselor for Economic Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and Counselor for Economic Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Canberra.  He also directly supported U.S. engagement in APEC while working in the Office of the Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment during the U.S. host year in 2011.</p>
<p>The United States fully supports APEC’s mission to advance a free, fair, and open economic policy agenda that benefits U.S. workers, businesses, and families.  The 21 APEC member economies account for approximately 47 percent of global trade, and the region is the destination for more than 62 percent of U.S. goods exports.  Through engagement at APEC, the United States supports U.S. innovation and the digital economy; helps U.S. companies do business and support jobs and families here at home; expands women’s participation in the economy; and promotes healthy, resilient, and sustainable economies.  APEC is a forum for the United States to help the region’s economies recover from the pandemic, enhance climate action, and support economic prosperity for our workers and all our people.</p>
