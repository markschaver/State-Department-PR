					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The text of the following statement was released by the G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union.</p>
<p><em>Begin Text:</em></p>
<p>We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union condemn in the strongest terms the unprecedented action by the Belarusian authorities in arresting independent journalist Raman Pratasevich and his companion, Sofia Sopega, after forcing flight FR4978 on which they were travelling to land in Minsk on 23 May.</p>
<p>This action jeopardised the safety of the passengers and crew of the flight. It was also a serious attack on the rules governing civil aviation. All our countries, and our citizens, depend on every state acting responsibly in fulfilling their duties under the Chicago Convention so that civil aircraft can operate safely and securely. We call on the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to urgently address this challenge to its rules and standards.</p>
<p>This action also represents a serious attack on media freedom. We demand the immediate and unconditional release of Raman Pratasevich, as well as all other journalists and political prisoners held in Belarus.</p>
<p>We will enhance our efforts, including through further sanctions as appropriate, to promote accountability for the actions of the Belarusian authorities.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Amman, Jordan</p>
<p>St. Regis Hotel</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Let me start with a few words before taking some questions.  And let me start, first of all, by congratulating the people of Jordan on the 75th anniversary of the kingdom’s independence this week.  I’d very much like to thank His Majesty King Abdullah for a very warm welcome today and a very good conversation.  Our time in Jordan has been brief, but we had very broad-ranging and very substantive discussions at the palace today.</p>
<p>Jordan’s recent contributions to help bring an end to the conflict in Israel demonstrate the kingdom’s enduring role as a force for peace in the region, which is one of the reasons our relationship is so strong and so vital.  His Majesty King Abdullah’s leadership has been crucial on this run, as it has been in so many other areas where Jordan and the United States work together, including efforts to promote stability, economic opportunity, and justice across the region.</p>
<p>Jordan is more than a strategic partner to America.  It’s a friend.  And friends stand by one another in challenging times, and I know this past period has been difficult on Jordan, as it has been on many of us.  Both of our nations are now grappling with how we can grow our economies so that they can deliver real opportunities for our people.  The fact that Jordan is doing this while continuing to show considerable generosity to people who came here fleeing violence and persecution is a reflection of the country’s character and the big hearts of the Jordanian people.</p>
<p>As you know, President Biden asked me to make this trip, and I’ve kept him updated on our progress throughout.  Securing the ceasefire was important, particularly because of the devastating toll violence took on families on both sides.  But we see the ceasefire not as an end, but as a beginning, something to build on.  Earlier today, I discussed how we can do this with President al-Sisi and Foreign Minister Shoukry in Cairo.  Egypt played a crucial role in brokering the ceasefire.  It’s already committed $500 million to the reconstruction effort in Gaza.  We talked about that.</p>
<p>We also discussed Egypt’s water needs and the importance of finding a diplomatic solution to issues around the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam that meet the legitimate needs of Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia.  I commended Egypt for its leadership in urging Libya’s legislature to keep elections on track for December, and we agreed on the need for all foreign forces to leave Libya.  I also underscored the importance that President Biden places on human rights, and we agreed to engage in a constructive dialogue on these issues in Egypt.</p>
<p>Here today in Amman, my conversation with His Majesty touched on, again, a range of topics, including the urgent work we need to do together to meet humanitarian and reconstruction needs in Gaza while ensuring that the Palestinian people, not Hamas, benefit from this assistance.  We discussed Jordan’s essential role as a custodian of Muslim holy places and the importance of preserving the historic status quo at Jerusalem’s holy sites.  Jordan also plays a vital role in the West Bank.  As the U.S. re-engages with the Palestinian people and reopens our consulate in Jerusalem, we’ll have a lot of work to do together as well.</p>
<p>Our meetings today in Cairo and Amman, indeed this whole trip, reflect a fundamental reality.  If we want to avoid a return to the harrowing violence of recent weeks, the countries of this region need to help and support one another.  In the coming days, I’ll be consulting broadly with Gulf countries and other partners to ensure we all contribute to recovery, stability, and the reduction of tensions.</p>
<p>We covered a fair bit of ground in a short trip, but I think one thing is very clear from the many conversations that I’ve had:  The aspirations of people in every place we visit – Palestinians, Israelis, Egyptians, Jordanians – are remarkably similar.  They want security for themselves and their loved ones.  They want opportunity.  They want greater equity.  They want their leaders to deliver on their most fundamental needs.  They want their rights to be respected.  They want to live with dignity.  These are the aspirations we all have, including Americans; indeed, they’re universal.  As people in this region make hard choices and do hard work to meet these goals, the United States will stand with them.</p>
<p>And with that, I’m happy to take some questions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  We’ll turn to Nike Ching.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  How are you?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We understand you had a very busy schedule today, so thank you for talking to the press.  On the human rights issue with regard to your meeting with – earlier today with President Sisi, are Americans or other detainees being released by Egypt soon?  How did the discussion come about, or was there a discussion to prompt the release?  And if I may, why not include a meeting with human rights defenders in Egypt in the original schedule?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you very much.  We had a lengthy discussion and exchange on human rights today in the meeting with President al-Sisi, which followed on President Biden’s conversation with President al-Sisi some days ago.  And a couple of things.  First, with regard to Americans who are detained, first let me say that we remain deeply saddened by the needless death in custody of Mustafa Kassem.  We’ve seen, I think, just in the last hours the Freedom Initiative and the good-faith work that it’s doing to put a light on this important issue.  I certainly raised this in my meeting today, and we’ll continue to do so until Americans are reunited with their families.</p>
<p>More broadly, I think you know that President Biden takes the issue of human rights and our commitment to human rights very seriously.  Indeed, he’s asked us to put it at the heart of our foreign policy, and that’s exactly what we’re doing, and that was reflected in the conversations that we had today.</p>
<p>Oh, and I’m sorry, as to – with regard to meetings, look, we had unfortunately in Egypt, and also here in Amman, a very compressed time to work with.  And I had an opportunity, as you know, when I was in Ramallah, to meet with civil society leaders, including some remarkable people who are working on human rights.  I expect that in the future and on future trips, I’ll have an opportunity to do more of that.  We just had, unfortunately, in Cairo, a very, very tight time and only were able to do meetings with the government.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Saleh Khawaldeh from Petra News Agency.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  Your Excellency, what’s the next U.S. step for dealing with the conflict after the ceasefire, especially after the – President Biden’s statement that the two-state solution is the only solution?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you very much.  The most urgent thing is humanitarian assistance for the people in Gaza, and particularly water, sanitation, electricity.  We all have to come together to answer those immediate needs.  Beyond that, reconstruction, rebuilding.  And we had very good conversations over the course of the last couple of days with the Palestinian Authority, with Israel, with Egypt, and we were also in conversation with the United Nations about that effort, and we’ve already contributed significant sums.  The Egyptians have contributed a very significant sum to the rebuilding process.  So we will start to engage in that as well.</p>
<p>But more broadly than that, what we want to see and what we’re working on is steps that all sides can take to reduce tensions and to build both some more trust and more hope going forward.  And as that takes shape and as that hopefully moves forward, then I think we’re – we can see the possibility of conditions developing in which it will be more possible to actually advance on the prospect of two states.  But most urgently, again, is dealing with the immediate needs of people and then taking the necessary steps that I think can create better conditions in which we can try to move forward on two states.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Tracy Wilkinson, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes, hi, thank you.  You had very long meetings today with both President Sisi and King Abdullah.  So I just wondered if you could give a little more detail about the kinds of steps you talked about them taking – Egypt, for example – beyond just reconstruction, but maintaining the ceasefire, keeping it in check.  You mentioned the money that Egypt is going to contribute to reconstruction, but what other concrete steps are they prepared to take?  For example, we’ve seen Israel has already relaxed some of the fishing restrictions on Gaza.  What in that kind of vein might Egypt take?  Jordan – King Abdullah for a long time has been very upset about restrictions that Israel is putting on access to al-Aqsa.  Have you been able to reassure him or convey any reassurances from Israel that that will be less of an issue in the future?</p>
<p>And then finally, a human rights question to follow up on the human rights issue with President Sisi.  This administration came in saying that human rights would be the core value of your foreign policy.  Do you feel at all like President Sisi thinks that maybe now that you need him for Gaza, he is somehow inoculated against your demands for improving the human rights situations in Egypt?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Great, thank you.  There are a number of things that everyone involved is looking at, and I think will be doing to address the – some of the needs that I’ve described.  And in particular when it comes to Gaza, there has to be – and we’re working on this – a process to, in a very deliberate way, evaluate exactly what is required, what needs to be rebuilt, and then how do we most effectively go about doing that.  And that is going to involve the United Nations, that’s going to involve Israel, Egypt, the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>And so we’re working to put together the right process, the right mechanism to do that.  And it really does start with assessing exactly what’s needed and then how to address the need.  And again, just to make the clear distinction, we have – and this is already moving – urgent humanitarian requirements, as I’ve said, particularly water, electricity, sanitation.  That’s already moving forward with different things moving into Gaza as we speak.</p>
<p>With regard to some of the flashpoints that contributed to the events of the last couple of weeks, we discussed those in some detail, to include the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Temple Mount, to include the evictions of Palestinians who’ve been living in homes for decades, even generations, to include a number of other issues of incitement to violence, payments to prisoners who – or their families, who are engaged or been engaged in acts of terrorism.  We cover all of those and more and shared our strongly held view that it’s really incumbent on all sides to, again, avoid taking steps that could potentially reignite this cycle of violence, and longer-term would make the efforts to pursue a two-state solution even more challenging than they already are.  So we certainly shared that.</p>
<p>And again, to come back to human rights, I think the fact that, as I said, we had a lengthy exchange on that with President al-Sisi as a reflection of the fact that it remains very much on the agenda with Egypt.  And my own exchange followed one that President Biden had with President al-Sisi when they spoke on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Final question from Priyanka Navani from Roya TV.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Good evening.  Thank you so much for being here, and welcome to Jordan.  Yesterday during a press conference with Netanyahu, you reaffirmed President Biden’s support for the idea that Palestinians and Israelis should both be able to leave – live, sorry – securely and safely.  And actually you just underscored that very point, that Palestinians should be able to live safely, in your speech.  But yesterday in your press conference, you said that the U.S. would be contributing more money to the Iron Dome, and then you said also that Palestinians – you would be expanding trade and investment in Palestine.  So I’m just wondering:  Why not commit to building infrastructure in Palestine that would keep Palestinians safe?  Maslow’s hierarchy would indicate that safety would be more of a priority than trade and investment.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you.  A few things there.  As we announced yesterday, the United States is in the process of providing more than $360 million of assistance to the Palestinian people.  That includes nearly $40 million in new assistance and that’s directed primarily to support the humanitarian efforts in the West Bank and Gaza.  The new assistance includes nearly 33 million for UNRWA in support of the West Bank and Gaza operations, an additional five and a half million, again, for humanitarian partners.</p>
<p>And all of this will support humanitarian organizations in the first instance to provide what’s needed immediately, and that’s the emergency shelter, food, relief items, health care, mental health, et cetera.  But beyond that, working with Congress, the State Department, USAID intend to provide about 75 million in additional development and economic assistance over the next year that can support relief, recovery, and indeed, infrastructure in the West Bank as well as in Gaza.  It will help advance private sector growth, which is really critical to bringing jobs to people who need them, as well as access to basic needs, services, like health care, like food.  And there are additional programs as well.  This is on top of about $250 million in economic, development, and security and humanitarian assistance that we announced before recent events, back in March and April.</p>
<p>And that’s where you get to a total of about $360 million for the Palestinian people.  All of this does go to building things – some concrete things, some programmatic things, all of which are designed to bring more hope, but also, concretely, more prospects, more opportunity for Palestinians.  And some of that need will include infrastructure.  This is critical because so much of this is, in the first instance, doing everything we can to improve in material ways the lives that people are living.  That’s where I think it starts.  That’s where you try to build hope as well as opportunity.  And that, both in a literal sense when it comes to infrastructure and in a broader sense, is the foundation, I believe, upon which maybe we can build something even better.</p>
<p>So there’s a lot that’s already in the works.  It’s going to take some time to see the effect, to see the impact, but it is moving forward.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Thank you very much.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Amman, Jordan</p>
<p>St. Regis Hotel</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Let me start with a few words before taking some questions.  And let me start, first of all, by congratulating the people of Jordan on the 75th anniversary of the kingdom’s independence this week.  I’d very much like to thank His Majesty King Abdullah for a very warm welcome today and a very good conversation.  Our time in Jordan has been brief, but we had very broad-ranging and very substantive discussions at the palace today.</p>
<p>Jordan’s recent contributions to help bring an end to the conflict in Israel demonstrate the kingdom’s enduring role as a force for peace in the region, which is one of the reasons our relationship is so strong and so vital.  His Majesty King Abdullah’s leadership has been crucial on this run, as it has been in so many other areas where Jordan and the United States work together, including efforts to promote stability, economic opportunity, and justice across the region.</p>
<p>Jordan is more than a strategic partner to America.  It’s a friend.  And friends stand by one another in challenging times, and I know this past period has been difficult on Jordan, as it has been on many of us.  Both of our nations are now grappling with how we can grow our economies so that they can deliver real opportunities for our people.  The fact that Jordan is doing this while continuing to show considerable generosity to people who came here fleeing violence and persecution is a reflection of the country’s character and the big hearts of the Jordanian people.</p>
<p>As you know, President Biden asked me to make this trip, and I’ve kept him updated on our progress throughout.  Securing the ceasefire was important, particularly because of the devastating toll violence took on families on both sides.  But we see the ceasefire not as an end, but as a beginning, something to build on.  Earlier today, I discussed how we can do this with President al-Sisi and Foreign Minister Shoukry in Cairo.  Egypt played a crucial role in brokering the ceasefire.  It’s already committed $500 million to the reconstruction effort in Gaza.  We talked about that.</p>
<p>We also discussed Egypt’s water needs and the importance of finding a diplomatic solution to issues around the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam that meet the legitimate needs of Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia.  I commended Egypt for its leadership in urging Libya’s legislature to keep elections on track for December, and we agreed on the need for all foreign forces to leave Libya.  I also underscored the importance that President Biden places on human rights, and we agreed to engage in a constructive dialogue on these issues in Egypt.</p>
<p>Here today in Amman, my conversation with His Majesty touched on, again, a range of topics, including the urgent work we need to do together to meet humanitarian and reconstruction needs in Gaza while ensuring that the Palestinian people, not Hamas, benefit from this assistance.  We discussed Jordan’s essential role as a custodian of Muslim holy places and the importance of preserving the historic status quo at Jerusalem’s holy sites.  Jordan also plays a vital role in the West Bank.  As the U.S. re-engages with the Palestinian people and reopens our consulate in Jerusalem, we’ll have a lot of work to do together as well.</p>
<p>Our meetings today in Cairo and Amman, indeed this whole trip, reflect a fundamental reality.  If we want to avoid a return to the harrowing violence of recent weeks, the countries of this region need to help and support one another.  In the coming days, I’ll be consulting broadly with Gulf countries and other partners to ensure we all contribute to recovery, stability, and the reduction of tensions.</p>
<p>We covered a fair bit of ground in a short trip, but I think one thing is very clear from the many conversations that I’ve had:  The aspirations of people in every place we visit – Palestinians, Israelis, Egyptians, Jordanians – are remarkably similar.  They want security for themselves and their loved ones.  They want opportunity.  They want greater equity.  They want their leaders to deliver on their most fundamental needs.  They want their rights to be respected.  They want to live with dignity.  These are the aspirations we all have, including Americans; indeed, they’re universal.  As people in this region make hard choices and do hard work to meet these goals, the United States will stand with them.</p>
<p>And with that, I’m happy to take some questions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  We’ll turn to Nike Ching.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  How are you?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We understand you had a very busy schedule today, so thank you for talking to the press.  On the human rights issue with regard to your meeting with – earlier today with President Sisi, are Americans or other detainees being released by Egypt soon?  How did the discussion come about, or was there a discussion to prompt the release?  And if I may, why not include a meeting with human rights defenders in Egypt in the original schedule?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you very much.  We had a lengthy discussion and exchange on human rights today in the meeting with President al-Sisi, which followed on President Biden’s conversation with President al-Sisi some days ago.  And a couple of things.  First, with regard to Americans who are detained, first let me say that we remain deeply saddened by the needless death in custody of Mustafa Kassem.  We’ve seen, I think, just in the last hours the Freedom Initiative and the good-faith work that it’s doing to put a light on this important issue.  I certainly raised this in my meeting today, and we’ll continue to do so until Americans are reunited with their families.</p>
<p>More broadly, I think you know that President Biden takes the issue of human rights and our commitment to human rights very seriously.  Indeed, he’s asked us to put it at the heart of our foreign policy, and that’s exactly what we’re doing, and that was reflected in the conversations that we had today.</p>
<p>Oh, and I’m sorry, as to – with regard to meetings, look, we had unfortunately in Egypt, and also here in Amman, a very compressed time to work with.  And I had an opportunity, as you know, when I was in Ramallah, to meet with civil society leaders, including some remarkable people who are working on human rights.  I expect that in the future and on future trips, I’ll have an opportunity to do more of that.  We just had, unfortunately, in Cairo, a very, very tight time and only were able to do meetings with the government.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Saleh Khawaldeh from Petra News Agency.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  Your Excellency, what’s the next U.S. step for dealing with the conflict after the ceasefire, especially after the – President Biden’s statement that the two-state solution is the only solution?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you very much.  The most urgent thing is humanitarian assistance for the people in Gaza, and particularly water, sanitation, electricity.  We all have to come together to answer those immediate needs.  Beyond that, reconstruction, rebuilding.  And we had very good conversations over the course of the last couple of days with the Palestinian Authority, with Israel, with Egypt, and we were also in conversation with the United Nations about that effort, and we’ve already contributed significant sums.  The Egyptians have contributed a very significant sum to the rebuilding process.  So we will start to engage in that as well.</p>
<p>But more broadly than that, what we want to see and what we’re working on is steps that all sides can take to reduce tensions and to build both some more trust and more hope going forward.  And as that takes shape and as that hopefully moves forward, then I think we’re – we can see the possibility of conditions developing in which it will be more possible to actually advance on the prospect of two states.  But most urgently, again, is dealing with the immediate needs of people and then taking the necessary steps that I think can create better conditions in which we can try to move forward on two states.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Tracy Wilkinson, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes, hi, thank you.  You had very long meetings today with both President Sisi and King Abdullah.  So I just wondered if you could give a little more detail about the kinds of steps you talked about them taking – Egypt, for example – beyond just reconstruction, but maintaining the ceasefire, keeping it in check.  You mentioned the money that Egypt is going to contribute to reconstruction, but what other concrete steps are they prepared to take?  For example, we’ve seen Israel has already relaxed some of the fishing restrictions on Gaza.  What in that kind of vein might Egypt take?  Jordan – King Abdullah for a long time has been very upset about restrictions that Israel is putting on access to al-Aqsa.  Have you been able to reassure him or convey any reassurances from Israel that that will be less of an issue in the future?</p>
<p>And then finally, a human rights question to follow up on the human rights issue with President Sisi.  This administration came in saying that human rights would be the core value of your foreign policy.  Do you feel at all like President Sisi thinks that maybe now that you need him for Gaza, he is somehow inoculated against your demands for improving the human rights situations in Egypt?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Great, thank you.  There are a number of things that everyone involved is looking at, and I think will be doing to address the – some of the needs that I’ve described.  And in particular when it comes to Gaza, there has to be – and we’re working on this – a process to, in a very deliberate way, evaluate exactly what is required, what needs to be rebuilt, and then how do we most effectively go about doing that.  And that is going to involve the United Nations, that’s going to involve Israel, Egypt, the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>And so we’re working to put together the right process, the right mechanism to do that.  And it really does start with assessing exactly what’s needed and then how to address the need.  And again, just to make the clear distinction, we have – and this is already moving – urgent humanitarian requirements, as I’ve said, particularly water, electricity, sanitation.  That’s already moving forward with different things moving into Gaza as we speak.</p>
<p>With regard to some of the flashpoints that contributed to the events of the last couple of weeks, we discussed those in some detail, to include the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Temple Mount, to include the evictions of Palestinians who’ve been living in homes for decades, even generations, to include a number of other issues of incitement to violence, payments to prisoners who – or their families, who are engaged or been engaged in acts of terrorism.  We cover all of those and more and shared our strongly held view that it’s really incumbent on all sides to, again, avoid taking steps that could potentially reignite this cycle of violence, and longer-term would make the efforts to pursue a two-state solution even more challenging than they already are.  So we certainly shared that.</p>
<p>And again, to come back to human rights, I think the fact that, as I said, we had a lengthy exchange on that with President al-Sisi as a reflection of the fact that it remains very much on the agenda with Egypt.  And my own exchange followed one that President Biden had with President al-Sisi when they spoke on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Final question from Priyanka Navani from Roya TV.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Good evening.  Thank you so much for being here, and welcome to Jordan.  Yesterday during a press conference with Netanyahu, you reaffirmed President Biden’s support for the idea that Palestinians and Israelis should both be able to leave – live, sorry – securely and safely.  And actually you just underscored that very point, that Palestinians should be able to live safely, in your speech.  But yesterday in your press conference, you said that the U.S. would be contributing more money to the Iron Dome, and then you said also that Palestinians – you would be expanding trade and investment in Palestine.  So I’m just wondering:  Why not commit to building infrastructure in Palestine that would keep Palestinians safe?  Maslow’s hierarchy would indicate that safety would be more of a priority than trade and investment.</p>

<p>So there’s a lot that’s already in the works.  It’s going to take some time to see the effect, to see the impact, but it is moving forward.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Thank you very much.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Jerusalem</p>
<p>David Citadel Hotel</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, welcome.  Thank you very much for talking to us today.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Hi.  Good to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  This isn’t – you’re of course not a stranger to the region.  This is far from being your first time here, but it’s the first time as Secretary of State.  And I wanted to begin by asking you about the ceasefire.  I mean, you seem to be in this cycle of every couple of years having a short but devastating war between Israel and Hamas, and of course, the U.S. played a constructive role in bringing about a ceasefire.</p>
<p>(Interruption.)</p>
<p>I’m going to ask just part of that again.  The U.S. played a constructive role in bringing about a ceasefire, but many Israelis believe that this is just a countdown to the next conflict.  What can be done?  What is the way out?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I think we do have to try to break the cycle of violence, because if we don’t it will repeat itself.  And maybe it’s next month, maybe it’s next year, maybe it’s in five years, but I don’t think that’s in anyone’s interests.  It’s not in the interests of Israelis.  It’s not in the interests of Palestinians.  It’s not in the interests of the broader region.</p>
<p>So I think we have to all try to work on a few things.  First, of course, we need to deal with the urgent situation in Gaza itself – humanitarian assistance, water, electricity, sanitation – to respond to the immediate needs.  We need to work together to try and rebuild and create some prospects for a better life for people who live in Gaza.  But then I think it’s really incumbent on both sides to try to do something to take away some of the things that can spark the cycle of violence.  And ultimately, what that really comes down to is, at least in our judgment, doing everything possible to make sure that Israelis and Palestinians alike have in their lives equal measures of security, of opportunity, of dignity.  And that manifests itself in many different ways, but I think at heart, that’s what needs to happen.  And so we spent some time today talking to our allies here in Israel about how that might go forward and did the same with the Palestinians.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Regarding the U.S.’s military assistance to Israel, during this operation in Gaza we heard mounting opposition from progressive lawmakers to the arms deal with Israel and trying to block it.  Is there any chance that the administration will reconsider the deal to supply Israel with precision-guided weapons?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  President Biden has been absolutely clear, and he’s been clear on more than one occasion:  We are committed to Israel’s security, period.  We will make sure that Israel has the means to defend itself.  And particularly when we have something like what the Israelis experienced in the last couple of weeks, attacks from a terrorist group indiscriminately targeting civilians, we want to make sure that Israel has the means to deal with that.</p>
<p>At the same time, as a democracy, I think Israel has an extra burden, and we owe the same thing to make sure that when it is defending itself, defending its citizens, it is doing everything it possibly can to avoid civilian casualties, to minimize the harm that is done to those who can get caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Do you believe that Israel did in this case?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I think Israel took very significant steps to do that, but we also know that on both sides men, women, and especially children were lost, and I think that’s deeply painful, and it’s a reminder that we throw around numbers, statistics, but these statistics, these numbers can’t hide the fact that we’re talking about real human beings.  And that’s important because I think it just reminds us about the need to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to avoid a repetition.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Taking the opportunity to talk about the bigger picture, the relationship between Israel and Palestinians, will there be an attempt to reignite the Israel-Palestinian peace process?  You spoke in your confirmation hearings saying that a Palestinian state is realistically – it’s hard to see near-term prospects for moving forward.  Do you still think that?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, two things.  I think a lot of work needs to be redone to try to rebuild some confidence, to try to rebuild some trust, to try to build some conditions and an environment in which it might be possible to re-engage in a meaningful way on two states.  But equally important, we continue to believe very strongly that a two-state solution is not just the best way, but probably the only way to really assure that going forward, Israel has a future as a secure Jewish and democratic state, and the Palestinians have a state to which they’re entitled.</p>
<p>So I think we want to get to that.  But right now, the focus is on dealing with the aftermath, the recent violence, trying to build on the ceasefire, address the immediate needs and concerns, and then see if over time the conditions are such that there’s a better environment for trying to pursue a two-state solution.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I want to move on to Iran.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said last Thursday that his country’s close to reaching a deal.  He said we have taken a big step and an agreement in principle has been achieved.  Is that true?  How close is the deal?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, I think that would be news to us, because we’re now, I think, in the fifth rounds of talks in Vienna.  These are – as I think you know – indirect talks.  We haven’t been talking directly to the Iranians.  It’s been through the European Union and our other partners.  I think we’ve clarified increasingly what each side would need to do to come back into compliance with the JCPOA, but it remains an unanswered question whether Iran is actually prepared to do what it needs to do to come back into compliance.  The jury is still out on that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Israeli prime minister has been quite clear in his opposition to the Iran deal.  Today during your joint statement, he said, “I hope the U.S.  not  to the old JCPOA.”  So let me ask you, Mr. Secretary, are the plans indeed to return to the same terms as the JCPOA or additional safeguards, for example to ensure that Iran – Iran’s compliance?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  The United States and Israel are absolutely united in the proposition that Iran can never acquire a nuclear weapon.  We are joined in that goal and in that commitment.  It’s also no secret that over time we’ve had differences over the best way to get there, to make sure that Iran does not get a weapon.  From our perspective, the JCPOA did exactly what it set out to accomplish, which was to cut off all of the pathways that Iran had to producing fissile material for a nuclear weapon on short order.  And our experts verified that it was working, international experts verified that it was working, and it had the most intrusive inspections regime of any arms control agreement ever achieved.  And the result was that when the agreement was in force, Iran, had it decided to try to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon, would have required at least a year to do so, which would have been plenty of time to see it and, if necessary, to do something about it.</p>
<p>But here’s what happened since.  Now that we’re out of the deal, Iran has started to ignore the constrains that the deal imposed.  And it is closer and closer and closer to being able to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon on very short order.  And so far from getting less dangerous without the deal, it’s gotten more dangerous.  And I think there’s a certain amount of urgency to try to put Iran back into the nuclear box that the deal constructed.</p>
<p>So having said that, if – what we’ve said along is if we succeed in doing that, if Iran returns to compliance with the deal, we would do the same.  We would also seek to make it, as we say, longer and stronger.  And we’d also work hard to engage the other issues where Iran is a very dangerous and problematic actor for us and for Israel – destabilizing activities in the region, proliferation of weapons, support for terrorist groups, et cetera.  All of those things &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So when you say “longer” does that mean the sunset clause is extended, for example?  It won’t end in 2031?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Yeah, I think this is important.  Of course, with the passage of time the different timelines have gotten shorter.  Having said that, the two most important timelines – the level at which Iran can enrich, 3.67 percent, the limits on the stockpile of enriched uranium to 300 kilograms – those don’t expire until 2030.  So if Iran were to come back into compliance, we would also have some time to seek to extend those deadlines and others.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Sir, I think you spoke in your acceptance speech – you spoke about your stepfather Samuel being a Holocaust survivor.  I think that resonated with many Israelis.  And I wanted to ask you:  When we see this rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S., could you tell us what that makes you feel not only on the national level as the Secretary of State, but on a personal level?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>It&#8217;s profoundly, profoundly disturbing.  And we have seen, not just in the last week although we&#8217;ve seen – well, actually, we have seen a very disturbing eruption of anti-Semitic incidents.  But the truth of the matter is anti-Semitism’s been on the rise in the United States and around the world for the last several years.  And we know this from history.  It’s the canary in the coal mine because it’s almost inevitable that when you see anti-Semitism erupt and emerge, hatred directed at other groups almost is sure to follow.  And we’re seeing that in the United States now with hatred directed, for example, at Asian Americans.</p>
<p>And so when I see that I feel it both on a very personal level, but I also see it as a warning sign, a signal that there are – things are happening that we have to address.  Because if it’s allowed to fester, if it’s allowed to grow, if it’s allowed to go even further with impunity, you wind up having a conflagration that affects a lot of people.  So we&#8217;re taking this very, very seriously.  I think you heard President Biden’s speech just yesterday – the most recent incidents we’ve seen in the United States, he called them despicable.  And we’re determined to deal with that and put it to an end.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict obviously has been stoking anti-Semitic violence in Europe for years.  When we see, for example, known figures on the far left in the United States referring to Israel as an apartheid state, are you worried that this rhetoric could lead to more anti-Semitic incidents, instead of calming things down?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>One of the – one of the great things about my job right now as Secretary of State is I don&#8217;t do politics, I just focus on policy.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>So I’m not going to ask you anything about Israeli politics either.  Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>No, no – no Israeli politics, no American politics.  But look, I think we all have to be attentive.  And whether – when we see anti-Semitism emerge anywhere, whether it’s in the United States, whether it’s in this part of the world, whether it’s anywhere in the world, we have to take it seriously, we have to address it, we have to deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Mr. Secretary, my final question:  President Biden, of course, has been here many times.  His famous story about as a young senator meeting Golda Meir, he’s been here as a senator and as a vice president.  Can you let us in on when his first visit as President will be to Israel?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>I don’t have the time, I don’t have the date, but I can tell you I know that he very much looks forward to coming back.  And you’re right, he’s been engaged here for – ever since Golda Meir.  And as he’s often said, he’s worked with every Israeli prime minister since Golda Meir.  This is something that he feels deeply: the relationship with Israel, the commitment to Israel’s security.  That’s something that’s very deeply rooted in him.  And of course, as a true friend of Israel’s, he’s also fully prepared to say when he might disagree with something.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the nature of our relationship, of our alliance, of our partnership.  We speak very directly, very frankly to each other, and ultimately we try to reason through problems together, right?  That was the nature of the conversations that I had today with the prime minister, with the foreign minister, with the defense minister, and so many others.  And I suspect that when the President does come here, he’ll pursue a long, longstanding conversation that he’s had going back a few years.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Well, you still have a long schedule in front of you, so thank you so much, Mr. Secretary, for talking to us today.  We really appreciate it.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Great to be with you.  Thanks for having me.</p>

<p>Jerusalem</p>
<p>David Citadel Hotel</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, welcome.  Thank you very much for talking to us today.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Hi.  Good to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  This isn’t – you’re of course not a stranger to the region.  This is far from being your first time here, but it’s the first time as Secretary of State.  And I wanted to begin by asking you about the ceasefire.  I mean, you seem to be in this cycle of every couple of years having a short but devastating war between Israel and Hamas, and of course, the U.S. played a constructive role in bringing about a ceasefire.</p>
<p>(Interruption.)</p>
<p>I’m going to ask just part of that again.  The U.S. played a constructive role in bringing about a ceasefire, but many Israelis believe that this is just a countdown to the next conflict.  What can be done?  What is the way out?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I think we do have to try to break the cycle of violence, because if we don’t it will repeat itself.  And maybe it’s next month, maybe it’s next year, maybe it’s in five years, but I don’t think that’s in anyone’s interests.  It’s not in the interests of Israelis.  It’s not in the interests of Palestinians.  It’s not in the interests of the broader region.</p>
<p>So I think we have to all try to work on a few things.  First, of course, we need to deal with the urgent situation in Gaza itself – humanitarian assistance, water, electricity, sanitation – to respond to the immediate needs.  We need to work together to try and rebuild and create some prospects for a better life for people who live in Gaza.  But then I think it’s really incumbent on both sides to try to do something to take away some of the things that can spark the cycle of violence.  And ultimately, what that really comes down to is, at least in our judgment, doing everything possible to make sure that Israelis and Palestinians alike have in their lives equal measures of security, of opportunity, of dignity.  And that manifests itself in many different ways, but I think at heart, that’s what needs to happen.  And so we spent some time today talking to our allies here in Israel about how that might go forward and did the same with the Palestinians.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Regarding the U.S.’s military assistance to Israel, during this operation in Gaza we heard mounting opposition from progressive lawmakers to the arms deal with Israel and trying to block it.  Is there any chance that the administration will reconsider the deal to supply Israel with precision-guided weapons?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  President Biden has been absolutely clear, and he’s been clear on more than one occasion:  We are committed to Israel’s security, period.  We will make sure that Israel has the means to defend itself.  And particularly when we have something like what the Israelis experienced in the last couple of weeks, attacks from a terrorist group indiscriminately targeting civilians, we want to make sure that Israel has the means to deal with that.</p>
<p>At the same time, as a democracy, I think Israel has an extra burden, and we owe the same thing to make sure that when it is defending itself, defending its citizens, it is doing everything it possibly can to avoid civilian casualties, to minimize the harm that is done to those who can get caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Do you believe that Israel did in this case?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I think Israel took very significant steps to do that, but we also know that on both sides men, women, and especially children were lost, and I think that’s deeply painful, and it’s a reminder that we throw around numbers, statistics, but these statistics, these numbers can’t hide the fact that we’re talking about real human beings.  And that’s important because I think it just reminds us about the need to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to avoid a repetition.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Taking the opportunity to talk about the bigger picture, the relationship between Israel and Palestinians, will there be an attempt to reignite the Israel-Palestinian peace process?  You spoke in your confirmation hearings saying that a Palestinian state is realistically – it’s hard to see near-term prospects for moving forward.  Do you still think that?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, two things.  I think a lot of work needs to be redone to try to rebuild some confidence, to try to rebuild some trust, to try to build some conditions and an environment in which it might be possible to re-engage in a meaningful way on two states.  But equally important, we continue to believe very strongly that a two-state solution is not just the best way, but probably the only way to really assure that going forward, Israel has a future as a secure Jewish and democratic state, and the Palestinians have a state to which they’re entitled.</p>
<p>So I think we want to get to that.  But right now, the focus is on dealing with the aftermath, the recent violence, trying to build on the ceasefire, address the immediate needs and concerns, and then see if over time the conditions are such that there’s a better environment for trying to pursue a two-state solution.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I want to move on to Iran.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said last Thursday that his country’s close to reaching a deal.  He said we have taken a big step and an agreement in principle has been achieved.  Is that true?  How close is the deal?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, I think that would be news to us, because we’re now, I think, in the fifth rounds of talks in Vienna.  These are – as I think you know – indirect talks.  We haven’t been talking directly to the Iranians.  It’s been through the European Union and our other partners.  I think we’ve clarified increasingly what each side would need to do to come back into compliance with the JCPOA, but it remains an unanswered question whether Iran is actually prepared to do what it needs to do to come back into compliance.  The jury is still out on that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Israeli prime minister has been quite clear in his opposition to the Iran deal.  Today during your joint statement, he said, “I hope the U.S.  not  to the old JCPOA.”  So let me ask you, Mr. Secretary, are the plans indeed to return to the same terms as the JCPOA or additional safeguards, for example to ensure that Iran – Iran’s compliance?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  The United States and Israel are absolutely united in the proposition that Iran can never acquire a nuclear weapon.  We are joined in that goal and in that commitment.  It’s also no secret that over time we’ve had differences over the best way to get there, to make sure that Iran does not get a weapon.  From our perspective, the JCPOA did exactly what it set out to accomplish, which was to cut off all of the pathways that Iran had to producing fissile material for a nuclear weapon on short order.  And our experts verified that it was working, international experts verified that it was working, and it had the most intrusive inspections regime of any arms control agreement ever achieved.  And the result was that when the agreement was in force, Iran, had it decided to try to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon, would have required at least a year to do so, which would have been plenty of time to see it and, if necessary, to do something about it.</p>
<p>But here’s what happened since.  Now that we’re out of the deal, Iran has started to ignore the constrains that the deal imposed.  And it is closer and closer and closer to being able to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon on very short order.  And so far from getting less dangerous without the deal, it’s gotten more dangerous.  And I think there’s a certain amount of urgency to try to put Iran back into the nuclear box that the deal constructed.</p>
<p>So having said that, if – what we’ve said along is if we succeed in doing that, if Iran returns to compliance with the deal, we would do the same.  We would also seek to make it, as we say, longer and stronger.  And we’d also work hard to engage the other issues where Iran is a very dangerous and problematic actor for us and for Israel – destabilizing activities in the region, proliferation of weapons, support for terrorist groups, et cetera.  All of those things &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So when you say “longer” does that mean the sunset clause is extended, for example?  It won’t end in 2031?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Yeah, I think this is important.  Of course, with the passage of time the different timelines have gotten shorter.  Having said that, the two most important timelines – the level at which Iran can enrich, 3.67 percent, the limits on the stockpile of enriched uranium to 300 kilograms – those don’t expire until 2030.  So if Iran were to come back into compliance, we would also have some time to seek to extend those deadlines and others.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Sir, I think you spoke in your acceptance speech – you spoke about your stepfather Samuel being a Holocaust survivor.  I think that resonated with many Israelis.  And I wanted to ask you:  When we see this rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S., could you tell us what that makes you feel not only on the national level as the Secretary of State, but on a personal level?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>It&#8217;s profoundly, profoundly disturbing.  And we have seen, not just in the last week although we&#8217;ve seen – well, actually, we have seen a very disturbing eruption of anti-Semitic incidents.  But the truth of the matter is anti-Semitism’s been on the rise in the United States and around the world for the last several years.  And we know this from history.  It’s the canary in the coal mine because it’s almost inevitable that when you see anti-Semitism erupt and emerge, hatred directed at other groups almost is sure to follow.  And we’re seeing that in the United States now with hatred directed, for example, at Asian Americans.</p>
<p>And so when I see that I feel it both on a very personal level, but I also see it as a warning sign, a signal that there are – things are happening that we have to address.  Because if it’s allowed to fester, if it’s allowed to grow, if it’s allowed to go even further with impunity, you wind up having a conflagration that affects a lot of people.  So we&#8217;re taking this very, very seriously.  I think you heard President Biden’s speech just yesterday – the most recent incidents we’ve seen in the United States, he called them despicable.  And we’re determined to deal with that and put it to an end.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict obviously has been stoking anti-Semitic violence in Europe for years.  When we see, for example, known figures on the far left in the United States referring to Israel as an apartheid state, are you worried that this rhetoric could lead to more anti-Semitic incidents, instead of calming things down?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>One of the – one of the great things about my job right now as Secretary of State is I don&#8217;t do politics, I just focus on policy.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>So I’m not going to ask you anything about Israeli politics either.  Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>No, no – no Israeli politics, no American politics.  But look, I think we all have to be attentive.  And whether – when we see anti-Semitism emerge anywhere, whether it’s in the United States, whether it’s in this part of the world, whether it’s anywhere in the world, we have to take it seriously, we have to address it, we have to deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Mr. Secretary, my final question:  President Biden, of course, has been here many times.  His famous story about as a young senator meeting Golda Meir, he’s been here as a senator and as a vice president.  Can you let us in on when his first visit as President will be to Israel?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>I don’t have the time, I don’t have the date, but I can tell you I know that he very much looks forward to coming back.  And you’re right, he’s been engaged here for – ever since Golda Meir.  And as he’s often said, he’s worked with every Israeli prime minister since Golda Meir.  This is something that he feels deeply: the relationship with Israel, the commitment to Israel’s security.  That’s something that’s very deeply rooted in him.  And of course, as a true friend of Israel’s, he’s also fully prepared to say when he might disagree with something.</p>
<p>But that’s exactly the nature of our relationship, of our alliance, of our partnership.  We speak very directly, very frankly to each other, and ultimately we try to reason through problems together, right?  That was the nature of the conversations that I had today with the prime minister, with the foreign minister, with the defense minister, and so many others.  And I suspect that when the President does come here, he’ll pursue a long, longstanding conversation that he’s had going back a few years.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Well, you still have a long schedule in front of you, so thank you so much, Mr. Secretary, for talking to us today.  We really appreciate it.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Great to be with you.  Thanks for having me.</p>
