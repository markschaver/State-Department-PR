					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining this call, and especially thanks for joining it on short notice.</p>
<p>As you saw from the department as well as from the White House this morning, Secretary Blinken will be traveling to Jerusalem, Ramallah, Cairo, and Amman at the request of President Biden and will be departing later today.  We wanted to give you an opportunity to hear a little bit more about this travel and to ask questions.</p>
<p>We have with us this morning a senior State Department official to offer a bit more context and to take your questions.  This call is embargoed until the end of the call.  It is also on background.  You can attribute what you hear to a senior State Department official.  Just for the knowledge of those on this call, you’ll be hearing today from , who will be speaking and answering your questions, but again, he will be referred to as a senior State Department official, and this is embargoed until the end of the call.</p>
<p>So with that, I will turn it over to our speaker.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thank you, and good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining.  I want to speak to you on the Secretary’s upcoming trip to Israel, the West Bank, Egypt, and Jordan, as well as take your questions after this bit, but first I want to recognize the important development of last week, the ceasefire led by Egypt.</p>
<p>This ceasefire was agreed to after 11 days of violence which tragically claimed the lives of innocent Palestinians and Israelis, including children, and it’s just really heartbreaking.  The United States wants to convey our deepest condolences to the families who have lost loved ones in the conflict, and our thoughts go out to those who are wounded.</p>
<p>We’re relieved the violence has come to an end, and I just really want to share that the U.S. worked tirelessly with all our partners in the region, including Israelis and Palestinians in public, but much, much more importantly, behind the scenes to help the ceasefire come about.  We really appreciate the important role played by Egypt, which was critical in the effort to mediate an end to the violence, and also really appreciate the roles of Jordan and Qatar and other partners who played a role here.</p>
<p>Look, in the wake of the ceasefire, Secretary Blinken will be traveling to Israel and the West Bank today and tomorrow, where he’ll meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.  He’ll then move on to Egypt and Jordan, where he’ll meet with leaders there to discuss recovery efforts and a means of working together to build better futures for people here on the ground and in the region.</p>
<p>Again, we’re incredibly relieved at the terrible violence which tore apart the lives of so many innocents has ended, and we’re committed to supporting all efforts to a lasting peace.  The Secretary looks forward to meeting regional leaders and discussing how the U.S. can support Israelis and Palestinians to rebuild and address the underlying causes that led to this crisis, and by advancing equal measures of freedom, security, and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians alike in tangible ways.</p>
<p>With that, I’d love to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Great, thanks very much.  We will start with the line of Nick Wadhams, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hey, I’m here.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Yes.  Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks.  , thank you.  It’s a short trip.  Can you give us a little more detail on what the Secretary hopes to achieve from this?  The ceasefire has already been signed.  Is it the hope that he will set them on the course toward actually trying to jumpstart broader peace talks, a lasting settlement?  Or is he more just hoping to provide impetus so that this ceasefire sticks?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thank you.  In the first instance, the most important thing is that the ceasefire does hold.  It’s an – extremely important that it does.  We just – we don’t want to see a return to the bloodshed that was heartbreaking during the 11-day conflict.  And we’re certainly going to look for ways to improve Israeli and Palestinian lives, and as we’ve said over and over again, advance freedom, security, and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians alike, hopefully in tangible ways in the immediate term.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Humeyra Pamuk.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Yes, we have you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Okay.  Thanks for this.  Just a quick follow-up on Nick and something else as well.  The Secretary and others have said the focus at the moment is to keep the ceasefire intact, and he just said that, and rebuild as well.  But just to push you a little bit on that because I really didn’t hear an answer, could this be an opportunity to lay the – at least the groundwork for future peace talks?  And if yes, what exactly will you be doing towards that?</p>
<p>And the second one is:  How can the U.S. guarantee aid to Gaza won’t be diverted toward replenishing the Hamas arsenal?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  So on the second question, we’re going to be working in partnership with the United Nations and the Palestinian Authority to kind of channel aid there in a manner that does its best to go to the people of Gaza.  I’m also sure that the Government of Egypt will have some role in that.  As we’ve seen in life, as we all know in life, there are no guarantees, but we’re going to do everything that we can to ensure that this assistance reaches the people who need it the most.</p>
<p>Again, regarding your question, we’re really focused primarily on ensuring that the ceasefire sticks and taking the steps to – taking tangible steps to advance the quality of people’s lives: advance their freedom, advance their security, and advance their prosperity.  We believe that in the immediate term, that’s what’s feasible and that’s what’s important.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  We’ll go to Barak Ravid.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Inaudible) questions.  First, is the Secretary going to meet also Minister of Defense Gantz and head of opposition, Lapid?  It wasn’t mentioned in the statement that was released.</p>
<p>And second, there seems to be quite a lot of donor fatigue around the world, and many countries are saying that they’re not going to give again money to reconstruct Gaza without the broader context of a two-state solution.  How are you going to deal with this position?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  , do you want to comment anything on the schedule?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Barak, the – we’ll have more details on the schedule as we get closer to the ground, and we’ll update as we can.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks, .  So look, on donor fatigue, we acknowledge that, we understand that, and it’s understandable.  There has been a cycle of violence between Israel and Hamas that’s gone on for years and it’s even over a decade old, so we understand that.  But we also understand that the international community does want to help the people of Gaza.  And so we’re just going to be focused on providing assistance – seeing that assistance is provided in a manner that’s consistent with our goals, and that’s what it’s about right now.  It’s just about improving lives today.  Over.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We’ll go to Lara Jakes.  Do we have Lara?</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment, please.  Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Oh, hi.  Thanks.  I’m sorry if this got asked in the first question.  My phone got dropped weirdly.  But I was just curious as to how you all envision helping rebuild Gaza by working with the PA given that Hamas and the PA can’t stand each other and Hamas controls Gaza.  How is that going to work?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>That’s a great question.  And we’ve been meeting regularly and intensively with the United Nations, which is going to – we expect to lead the reconstruction efforts there.  We’ve also been meeting with the PA and together with the United Nations to look for a formula to kind of create a partnership between the United Nations and the Palestinian Authority to channel through the reconstruction assistance.  And I think we don’t talk to Hamas, obviously, but we would – we expect that they understand that if assistance is going to come in, that’s the manner it’s going to do so.  But you’re right; it presents significant challenges.  But we believe that by doing so it will get us on the pathway, we hope eventually, to a reintegration to some extent of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza, which we hope in turn can help create the conditions to move us forward to a more stable situation.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We’ll go to Nadia Bilbassy.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>(Inaudible) hear me?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Yes.  Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Okay, great.  Thank you for doing this.  Thank you,  – thank you, .  Sorry.  So two of my questions have been asked, but let me rephrase – so basically, can you say it’s premature to think that this trip will really ignite the peace process, and the focus mainly really is on reconstruction and on maintaining the ceasefire?  Number one.  And number two, since there is – one of my colleagues mentioned the donor fatigue, can – did you ask the Gulf states to help since they have been talking about helping Gaza, despite of Hamas being in control?  And will the money again be channeled through the PA, or the UN, or one of the states who have some influence on Hamas, which is primarily Qatar? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thank you, Nadia, for the question.  They’re good questions.  Look, so in terms of the funding, we’re in close communication with our partners in the Gulf about how to move forward.  Things are still pretty early.  The United Nations hasn’t even completed its back-of-the-envelope assessment yet in terms of the needs, and they’ll be going into Gaza and continue to go in to conduct these assessments in the days ahead. But we’re in touch with the Gulf, and again, we are – and other donors – and we’re trying to structure things, again, in a way that diminishes Hamas’s abilities, strengthens the people of Gaza, begins a process of hopefully reintroducing and reintegrating the Palestinian Authority into Gaza, and is in partnership with the United Nations.  We are – as I said, we are primarily focused on making sure that the ceasefire holds, on making sure that the people of Gaza get the relief that they desperately need, and that we create the conditions to hopefully advance forward.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We’ll go to Nike Ching.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>(Inaudible) call.  I would like to ask about the Palestinian elections.  Does the United States have a position on Palestinian elections?  Do you see the elections as a necessary step towards reviving Palestinian democratic institutions?  And is there something on the agenda when Secretary Blinken met with Abbas?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>So look, the administration has been consistent that the exercise of democratic elections are a matter for the Palestinian people and government to determine, not the United States Government.  So that’s – we believe that democracy is up to them and it’s up to the Palestinian people in government on how to proceed. So I’ll just leave it there.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We’ll go to Mouhamed Elahmed.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi.  Thank you for doing this.  I have three questions.  First, should we expect an extension of the Secretary trip to the Middle East that would include a possible visit to the Gulf region as well?  Also, would the U.S. consider inviting the parties to Washington, D.C. – that is, the Palestinians and the Israelis – as well as regional players and leaders to Washington, D.C., for example, to revive the peace talks?  And last question:  What is the U.S. vision to the solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict at the drop of what happened recently?  Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thank you so much for those questions.  So the United States remains committed to the two-state solution.  That remains the vision of the United States, and we are not wavering from that in any way.  It’s probably premature at this time to invite the parties to Washington or anywhere else.  We are – so this will be the Secretary’s first trip to the region.  He’ll be engaging with the parties and listening to them and – again, with a focus on a cease – ensuring that the ceasefire holds and keeping – ensuring that the ceasefire holds.  I’ll just leave it there.  In terms of the expansion of the trip, , I’ll leave all those questions to you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Sure.  Thanks for that.  At this point, we expect the Secretary will be visiting Jerusalem, Ramallah, Cairo, and Amman.  As always, if there are updates to that schedule, we will let you know.</p>
<p>We’ll go to the line of Andrea Mitchell.  Do we have Andrea?</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  I do not see Andrea’s &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  It look – it may be spelled “An Mitchell” in the system.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Oh, yes.  Thank you, one moment.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Go ahead, Andrea.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, can you hear me?  Given the perception that Hamas has been considerably strengthened politically by this with the people of Gaza showing their muscle against Israel, do they effectively have veto power over how the aid, if it materializes, is going to be distributed despite the efforts to run it through the UN and the Palestinian Authority?  Just following up on what Lara asked, how do you circumvent the PA in this instance?</p>
<p>And secondly, how important is it to get some kind of commitment – if not elections, but some other kind of commitment from the Palestinian Authority given the problems that they have had in the past in terms of proper administration of aid?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Right, so thank you for those questions.  We certainly don’t see Hamas as having a veto power.  We’re going to be working with the United Nations, and the United Nations has a significant and meaningful presence on the ground there.  And we are confident that working in partnership with them and also with the involvement of the Palestinian Authority in the process, we will get the job done.</p>
<p>In terms of the Palestinian Authority, look, again, the aid is going to be primarily going through the United Nations with the participation of the Palestinian Authority.  And that’s going to be our – that’s going to be our focus.  So we’re not – so that’s really going to be our focus.  I’ll leave it there.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  We’ll take a final question or two here.  Let’s go to the line of Karen DeYoung.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes, hi, thank you.  Given that the Israelis said that their goal during this operation was to prevent a recurrence – in other words, to completely destroy the Hamas infrastructure and armaments that let this happen – are you confident at this point that Israel has either achieved that goal, or has agreed, if not, that it – that this is over, that it will be abide by the ceasefire?  And also, does Secretary Blinken plan on addressing with the Israeli Government some of the concerns that have been expressed here, particularly in Congress, about Israeli actions and how that might influence the relationship and assistance relationship in the future?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  So what I would say is first of all, I’m not going to get into the content of the conversations that we expect to happen, but there’s no question there will be forthright and important conversations on the Secretary’s first trip out here.</p>
<p>In terms of the destruction of Hamas’s capabilities, my sense is – our sense is that, of course, that’s not complete.  They’re still there on the ground, they’re still a presence, and that’s why we’re restructuring the way we engage on this file in a manner that seeks to diminish and contain their efforts.  But look, we take the commitments we received from all the parties seriously, and we have every hope and expectation that the ceasefire will continue to hold, at least in the immediate term, and we’re going to do everything we can to work with our partners to ensure that it does continue to hold.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’ll just – I’ll leave it there.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  And we’ll take a final question from Michele Kelemen.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Okay.  So I’m just – I’m wondering, just broadly, do you see any prospects of reviving diplomacy between Israelis and Palestinians?  And how is the street violence within Israeli cities complicating any of this?  Have you had any message to Israel about that?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  So again, our primary focus is on maintaining the ceasefire, getting the assistance to the people who need it.  In the first instance, we’ve restarted, as you’ve seen, our relationship with the Palestinian people and leadership that was missing in action for a number of years now and did nothing to restart diplomacy, so in and of itself, that is an important first step.  This is going to be an important trip for the Secretary to meet with Israeli leaders and three Arab leaders in Ramallah, Cairo, and Amman, Jordan, along with their associates.  So we are kind of reopening the chapter of engagement and working that way.</p>
<p>Look, in terms of the inter-communal violence and tensions in Israel, obviously, I think the world has seen that.  That is a significant concern.  And look, the United States has just gone through a period where we have kind of confronted or been forced to confront our own challenges at home.  And so we understand that other countries are also going through similar challenges.  So that will be – so I’m sure – let me just say while the focus is primarily on making sure the ceasefire holds in Gaza and bilateral relations with the governments with which we’ll be meeting, obviously, other issues like that I’m sure will come up.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Well, thanks very much to our speaker.  Thanks very much for everyone who was able to call in.  As a reminder, this call is on background to a senior State Department official.  And with that, the embargo is lifted.  Thank you all very much.</p>

<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thank you, and good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining.  I want to speak to you on the Secretary’s upcoming trip to Israel, the West Bank, Egypt, and Jordan, as well as take your questions after this bit, but first I want to recognize the important development of last week, the ceasefire led by Egypt.</p>

<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>So look, the administration has been consistent that the exercise of democratic elections are a matter for the Palestinian people and government to determine, not the United States Government.  So that’s – we believe that democracy is up to them and it’s up to the Palestinian people in government on how to proceed. So I’ll just leave it there.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We’ll go to Mouhamed Elahmed.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi.  Thank you for doing this.  I have three questions.  First, should we expect an extension of the Secretary trip to the Middle East that would include a possible visit to the Gulf region as well?  Also, would the U.S. consider inviting the parties to Washington, D.C. – that is, the Palestinians and the Israelis – as well as regional players and leaders to Washington, D.C., for example, to revive the peace talks?  And last question:  What is the U.S. vision to the solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict at the drop of what happened recently?  Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thank you so much for those questions.  So the United States remains committed to the two-state solution.  That remains the vision of the United States, and we are not wavering from that in any way.  It’s probably premature at this time to invite the parties to Washington or anywhere else.  We are – so this will be the Secretary’s first trip to the region.  He’ll be engaging with the parties and listening to them and – again, with a focus on a cease – ensuring that the ceasefire holds and keeping – ensuring that the ceasefire holds.  I’ll just leave it there.  In terms of the expansion of the trip, , I’ll leave all those questions to you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Sure.  Thanks for that.  At this point, we expect the Secretary will be visiting Jerusalem, Ramallah, Cairo, and Amman.  As always, if there are updates to that schedule, we will let you know.</p>
<p>We’ll go to the line of Andrea Mitchell.  Do we have Andrea?</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  I do not see Andrea’s &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  It look – it may be spelled “An Mitchell” in the system.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Oh, yes.  Thank you, one moment.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Go ahead, Andrea.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, can you hear me?  Given the perception that Hamas has been considerably strengthened politically by this with the people of Gaza showing their muscle against Israel, do they effectively have veto power over how the aid, if it materializes, is going to be distributed despite the efforts to run it through the UN and the Palestinian Authority?  Just following up on what Lara asked, how do you circumvent the PA in this instance?</p>
<p>And secondly, how important is it to get some kind of commitment – if not elections, but some other kind of commitment from the Palestinian Authority given the problems that they have had in the past in terms of proper administration of aid?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Right, so thank you for those questions.  We certainly don’t see Hamas as having a veto power.  We’re going to be working with the United Nations, and the United Nations has a significant and meaningful presence on the ground there.  And we are confident that working in partnership with them and also with the involvement of the Palestinian Authority in the process, we will get the job done.</p>
<p>In terms of the Palestinian Authority, look, again, the aid is going to be primarily going through the United Nations with the participation of the Palestinian Authority.  And that’s going to be our – that’s going to be our focus.  So we’re not – so that’s really going to be our focus.  I’ll leave it there.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  We’ll take a final question or two here.  Let’s go to the line of Karen DeYoung.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes, hi, thank you.  Given that the Israelis said that their goal during this operation was to prevent a recurrence – in other words, to completely destroy the Hamas infrastructure and armaments that let this happen – are you confident at this point that Israel has either achieved that goal, or has agreed, if not, that it – that this is over, that it will be abide by the ceasefire?  And also, does Secretary Blinken plan on addressing with the Israeli Government some of the concerns that have been expressed here, particularly in Congress, about Israeli actions and how that might influence the relationship and assistance relationship in the future?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  So what I would say is first of all, I’m not going to get into the content of the conversations that we expect to happen, but there’s no question there will be forthright and important conversations on the Secretary’s first trip out here.</p>
<p>In terms of the destruction of Hamas’s capabilities, my sense is – our sense is that, of course, that’s not complete.  They’re still there on the ground, they’re still a presence, and that’s why we’re restructuring the way we engage on this file in a manner that seeks to diminish and contain their efforts.  But look, we take the commitments we received from all the parties seriously, and we have every hope and expectation that the ceasefire will continue to hold, at least in the immediate term, and we’re going to do everything we can to work with our partners to ensure that it does continue to hold.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’ll just – I’ll leave it there.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  And we’ll take a final question from Michele Kelemen.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Okay.  So I’m just – I’m wondering, just broadly, do you see any prospects of reviving diplomacy between Israelis and Palestinians?  And how is the street violence within Israeli cities complicating any of this?  Have you had any message to Israel about that?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  So again, our primary focus is on maintaining the ceasefire, getting the assistance to the people who need it.  In the first instance, we’ve restarted, as you’ve seen, our relationship with the Palestinian people and leadership that was missing in action for a number of years now and did nothing to restart diplomacy, so in and of itself, that is an important first step.  This is going to be an important trip for the Secretary to meet with Israeli leaders and three Arab leaders in Ramallah, Cairo, and Amman, Jordan, along with their associates.  So we are kind of reopening the chapter of engagement and working that way.</p>
<p>Look, in terms of the inter-communal violence and tensions in Israel, obviously, I think the world has seen that.  That is a significant concern.  And look, the United States has just gone through a period where we have kind of confronted or been forced to confront our own challenges at home.  And so we understand that other countries are also going through similar challenges.  So that will be – so I’m sure – let me just say while the focus is primarily on making sure the ceasefire holds in Gaza and bilateral relations with the governments with which we’ll be meeting, obviously, other issues like that I’m sure will come up.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Well, thanks very much to our speaker.  Thanks very much for everyone who was able to call in.  As a reminder, this call is on background to a senior State Department official.  And with that, the embargo is lifted.  Thank you all very much.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States has deepening concerns about the ongoing crisis in Ethiopia’s Tigray region as well as other threats to the sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity of Ethiopia. People in Tigray continue to suffer human rights violations, abuses, and atrocities, and urgently needed humanitarian relief is being blocked by the Ethiopian and Eritrean militaries as well as other armed actors. Despite significant diplomatic engagement, the parties to the conflict in Tigray have taken no meaningful steps to end hostilities or pursue a peaceful resolution of the political crisis. The United States condemns in the strongest terms the killings, forced removals, systemic sexual violence, and other human rights violations and abuses. We are equally appalled by the destruction of civilian property including water sources, hospitals, and medical facilities, taking place in Tigray. We call on the Ethiopian government to meet public commitments to hold accountable all those responsible for human rights violations and abuses, to protect civilians, and to ensure unhindered humanitarian access. We call for the Eritrean government to live up to its public commitment and immediately return its troops to internationally recognized Eritrean territory. Without an immediate cessation of hostilities and a rapid expansion of humanitarian access, current and significant food insecurity could lead to famine.</p>
<p>The time for action from the international community is now. Today, I am announcing a visa restriction policy under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act on the issuance of visas for any current or former Ethiopian or Eritrean government officials, members of the security forces, or other individuals—to include Amhara regional and irregular forces and members of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF)—responsible for, or complicit in, undermining resolution of the crisis in Tigray. This includes those who have conducted wrongful violence or other abuses against people in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, as well as those who have hindered access of humanitarian assistance to those in the region. Immediate family members of such persons may also be subject to these restrictions. Should those responsible for undermining a resolution of the crisis in Tigray fail to reverse course, they should anticipate further actions from the United States and the international community. We call on other governments to join us in taking these actions.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have imposed wide-ranging restrictions on economic and security assistance to Ethiopia and will bring our defense trade control policy in line with them. We will continue humanitarian assistance and certain other critical aid to Ethiopia in areas such as health, food security, basic education, support for women and girls, human rights and democracy, good governance, and conflict mitigation, consistent with available authorities. The United States will continue its existing broad restrictions on assistance to Eritrea.</p>
<p>The United States reiterates its calls for a durable, political solution to the crisis. We are committed to supporting efforts to resolve the crisis in Tigray and help Ethiopians advance reconciliation and dialogue to overcome current divisions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States strongly condemns the forced diversion of a flight between two EU member states and the subsequent removal and arrest of journalist Raman Pratasevich in Minsk. We demand his immediate release. This shocking act perpetrated by the Lukashenka regime endangered the lives of more than 120 passengers, including U.S. citizens. Initial reports suggesting the involvement of the Belarusian security services and the use of Belarusian military aircraft to escort the plane are deeply concerning and require full investigation.</p>
<p>We are closely coordinating our response with our partners, including the EU and Lithuanian and Greek officials. Given indications the forced landing was based on false pretenses, we support the earliest possible meeting of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization to review these events.</p>
<p>Independent media are an essential pillar supporting the rule of law and a vital component of a democratic society. The United States once again condemns the Lukashenka regime’s ongoing harassment and arbitrary detention of journalists. We stand with the Belarusian people in their aspirations for a free, democratic, and prosperous future and support their call for the regime to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington D.C.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Joining me now is the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.  Welcome, Mr. Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks, Fareed.  It’s great to be with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  President Biden says that he thinks now that there is a ceasefire in – between the Israelis and Palestinians – there is a significant opportunity for even more positive developments, or a “genuine opportunity,” I think, if I’m quoting him correctly.  And I’m wondering:  Is there really?  I mean, you have an Israeli Government that seems pretty unyielding.  You have a Palestinian Authority led by an 85-year-old man who doesn’t – is too scared to hold elections for fear of what will happen.  Hamas controls Gaza.  Is there really a prospect of some kind of movement towards a genuine political solution?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Fareed, I think there has to be.  I think both sides are reminded that we have to find a way to break the cycle, because if we don’t, it will repeat itself at great cost and at great human suffering on all sides.  Look, we worked very hard with this intense but behind-the-scenes diplomacy to get to the ceasefire, and I think President Biden leading this effort made the judgment that we could be most effective in doing that.  And ultimately, after this intensive effort across the government, we got to where everyone wanted to be, which was to end the violence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, as the President said, I think it’s incumbent upon all of us to try to make the turn to start to build something more positive.  And what that means at heart is that Palestinians and Israelis alike have to know in their day-in and day-out lives equal measures of opportunity, of security, of dignity, something that you touched on in your piece in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Will you use, as a template, the last peace plan put forward by the United States Government that is the peace plan shepherded by Jared Kushner?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Look, I don’t think we’re at the – in a place where the – getting to some kind of a negotiation for what ultimately, I think, has to be the result, which is a two-state solution, is the first order of business.  We have to start building back in concrete ways and offering some genuine hope, prospects, opportunity in the lives of people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, in the first instance, we’ve got to deal with the humanitarian situation, which is grave in Gaza.  We’ve got to start to bring countries together to support reconstruction and development.  And as we’re doing that, we’ll be re-engaging with the Palestinians, of course, continuing our deep engagement with the Israelis, and trying to put in place conditions that allow us over time hopefully to advance a genuine peace process.  But that is not the immediate order of business.  We have a lot of work to do to get to that point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  But does the United States Government still endorse the outlines of that plan?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  We’re going to look at everything that’s been done before, learn from that just as we have in other areas, and see what makes sense and what doesn’t.  But our focus right now relentlessly is on dealing with the humanitarian situation, starting to be – to do reconstruction and rebuild, and engage intensely with everyone, with Palestinians, with Israelis, with partners in the region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Prime Minister Netanyahu says that he will form a national unity government, but not with any Israeli Arabs in it.  Israeli Arabs, as you know, make up 20 percent of the population of Israel.  Is that a positive step?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Look, I don’t do politics, whether it’s our politics or Israeli politics.  They have to make their own judgments, and the government will be formed eventually, one way or another.  We leave that to the Israelis.  But we will work with, obviously, the current Israeli Government, whatever government emerges from the current process, and it’s really a decision for Israelis to make, not us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  But you have been very clear in being in favor of democracy and worrying about the decay of democracy in countries.  Is it a step forward for democracy for a national government explicitly, on racial lines, to rule out 20 percent of its population?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Look, one thing that’s been, I think, deeply disturbing about recent events has been the inter-communal violence.  And that’s something that we have not seen, at least in recent years.  And I believe and I hope that Israelis of all persuasions will find ways to come together to try to make sure that that doesn’t happen again.  And hopefully that finds expression as well in their politics and in their governments.  But again, these are decisions for Israelis to make, not for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Let me ask you while we’re on the Middle East, Mr. Secretary:  The Biden administration, President Biden when he was campaigning said as soon as I become president, we will rejoin the Iran nuclear deal.  The Iranians said the same thing.  We’re now four months into the administration.  Nothing has happened.  Both sides said there seems to be a – something of a stand-off.  And Iran is meanwhile visibly enriching, the very thing people like you warned about when – again, when Joe Biden was campaigning.  Isn’t this a failure of diplomacy?  Shouldn’t you guys have been able to get back into the deal within a week or two?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Two things, Fareed.  First, I think the steps that Iran is taking underscore the urgency of trying to get Iran back into compliance with its obligations under the nuclear deal, the deal that stopped their – the dangerous aspects of their nuclear program, the prospect that they could have fissile material for a nuclear weapon on short order.  We’ve had, I think, five rounds of conversations now, of talks now, indirect in Vienna.  And in fact, our team’s going back to Vienna in the coming days to pursue that.  I think we’ve actually made progress in clarifying what each side needs to do to get back into full compliance.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outstanding question, the question that we don’t have an answer to yet, is whether Iran, at the end of the day, is willing to do what is necessary to come back into compliance with the agreement.  That’s the proposition that we’re testing.  But it’s getting, I think, through these rounds of discussions and talks, clearer and clearer what needs to happen.  The question is:  Is Iran prepared to do it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Well, the Iranians say that that’s actually not what’s happening, what – the United States – the Biden administration has moved the goalposts, that rather than talking about simply both sides getting back to the original deal, doing what was required to comply, the Biden administration is now saying they want to talk about ballistic missiles, they want to talk about regional issues, they want to talk about extending the timeline.  Are you willing to go back to the original deal as it was?  Because the Iranians say they are willing to get back to that tomorrow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Fareed, we’ve been very clear.  We are fully prepared to go back to the original deal as it was.  That’s our initial objective.  And we – again, we don’t know if the Iranians are.  If we do, if we succeed in that, then we can use that as a foundation both to look at how we can make the deal itself potentially longer and stronger, and also engage on these other issues, whether it’s Iran’s support for terrorism, its proliferation, its destabilizing support for different proxies throughout the Middle East. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of that does need to be engaged and something we need to deal with, but we’ve been very clear that from our perspective, the first step needs to be a return to mutual compliance.  That’s what we’re working on and that’s where we still don’t know if Iran is willing to say yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Saudi Arabia says that it now is willing to contemplate better relations with Iran.  Is this a recognition by Saudi Arabia that its strategy so far has not really worked?  Is it a sign that we could see a peace deal in Yemen and we could see an easing of tensions over places like Qatar and Lebanon?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, there needs to be a peace deal in Yemen.  We’re working very hard on that.  We’ve been doing that from day one.  And I think Saudi Arabia has clearly indicated by some of the things that it’s done that it now wants to move in that direction, so that’s very positive.  We need to get the Houthis to come along.  And that, in turn, I think depends significantly on whether Iran is ready to make clear to the Houthis that they need to engage positively and need to resolve this war. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So to the extent that there is a better relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran, that can produce or help produce at least more positive results in ending some of these other conflicts, ending some of these proxy battles, which are incredibly dangerous, incredibly potentially destabilizing, and have a real human toll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  And do you see a shift in Saudi foreign policy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Look, my sense is that, again, on Yemen in particular, where we’ve engaged intensely – we have a senior envoy who is doing this every single day – the Saudis have been engaged productively in trying to bring this war to an end.  We need to see the same kind of response from the Houthis who continue to hold out, and Iran should use the influence it has to move them in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  You just met with the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, and I was wondering:  I mean, this is a country that has, by the acknowledgement of U.S. intelligence, engaged in what is possibly the largest cyber hack of America ever, massed 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border, and still continues to, in various ways, oppose U.S. interests and – essentially to kind of act as a spoiler on the world stage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Look, we had, I think, a constructive, very businesslike conversation over the course of nearly two hours, but President Biden has been very clear with President Putin, and I repeated what President Biden has said to President Putin, to Foreign Minister Lavrov, and that’s this:  We would prefer to have a more stable, predictable relationship with Russia.  We’ve all got lots of things going on around the world and lots of work that we’re trying to do to make the lives of our citizens a little bit better.  A more stable, predictable relationship with them, I think, would be good for us, good for them, and I’d even argue good for the world.  And there are clearly areas where it’s in our mutual interest to find ways to cooperate, whether it’s on Afghanistan, whether it’s on so-called strategic stability, arms control agreements, whether it’s on dealing with climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But equally clear – and the President has been very resolute on this – if Russia continues to take reckless and aggressive actions aimed at us or aimed at our allies and partners, we will respond, not for purposes of escalating, not to seek conflict, but to defend our interests.  And that was the nature of the conversation that I had with Foreign Minister Lavrov.  It’s really important to be very clear about what you’re doing, why you’re doing it.  And ultimately, it is up to Russia to decide whether it wants to have that more predictable, stable relationship.  We need to test the proposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, thank you for coming on the show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks for having me, Fareed.  It’s great to be with you.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington D.C.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Joining me now is the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.  Welcome, Mr. Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks, Fareed.  It’s great to be with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  President Biden says that he thinks now that there is a ceasefire in – between the Israelis and Palestinians – there is a significant opportunity for even more positive developments, or a “genuine opportunity,” I think, if I’m quoting him correctly.  And I’m wondering:  Is there really?  I mean, you have an Israeli Government that seems pretty unyielding.  You have a Palestinian Authority led by an 85-year-old man who doesn’t – is too scared to hold elections for fear of what will happen.  Hamas controls Gaza.  Is there really a prospect of some kind of movement towards a genuine political solution?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Fareed, I think there has to be.  I think both sides are reminded that we have to find a way to break the cycle, because if we don’t, it will repeat itself at great cost and at great human suffering on all sides.  Look, we worked very hard with this intense but behind-the-scenes diplomacy to get to the ceasefire, and I think President Biden leading this effort made the judgment that we could be most effective in doing that.  And ultimately, after this intensive effort across the government, we got to where everyone wanted to be, which was to end the violence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, as the President said, I think it’s incumbent upon all of us to try to make the turn to start to build something more positive.  And what that means at heart is that Palestinians and Israelis alike have to know in their day-in and day-out lives equal measures of opportunity, of security, of dignity, something that you touched on in your piece in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Will you use, as a template, the last peace plan put forward by the United States Government that is the peace plan shepherded by Jared Kushner?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Look, I don’t think we’re at the – in a place where the – getting to some kind of a negotiation for what ultimately, I think, has to be the result, which is a two-state solution, is the first order of business.  We have to start building back in concrete ways and offering some genuine hope, prospects, opportunity in the lives of people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, in the first instance, we’ve got to deal with the humanitarian situation, which is grave in Gaza.  We’ve got to start to bring countries together to support reconstruction and development.  And as we’re doing that, we’ll be re-engaging with the Palestinians, of course, continuing our deep engagement with the Israelis, and trying to put in place conditions that allow us over time hopefully to advance a genuine peace process.  But that is not the immediate order of business.  We have a lot of work to do to get to that point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  But does the United States Government still endorse the outlines of that plan?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  We’re going to look at everything that’s been done before, learn from that just as we have in other areas, and see what makes sense and what doesn’t.  But our focus right now relentlessly is on dealing with the humanitarian situation, starting to be – to do reconstruction and rebuild, and engage intensely with everyone, with Palestinians, with Israelis, with partners in the region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Prime Minister Netanyahu says that he will form a national unity government, but not with any Israeli Arabs in it.  Israeli Arabs, as you know, make up 20 percent of the population of Israel.  Is that a positive step?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Look, I don’t do politics, whether it’s our politics or Israeli politics.  They have to make their own judgments, and the government will be formed eventually, one way or another.  We leave that to the Israelis.  But we will work with, obviously, the current Israeli Government, whatever government emerges from the current process, and it’s really a decision for Israelis to make, not us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  But you have been very clear in being in favor of democracy and worrying about the decay of democracy in countries.  Is it a step forward for democracy for a national government explicitly, on racial lines, to rule out 20 percent of its population?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Look, one thing that’s been, I think, deeply disturbing about recent events has been the inter-communal violence.  And that’s something that we have not seen, at least in recent years.  And I believe and I hope that Israelis of all persuasions will find ways to come together to try to make sure that that doesn’t happen again.  And hopefully that finds expression as well in their politics and in their governments.  But again, these are decisions for Israelis to make, not for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Let me ask you while we’re on the Middle East, Mr. Secretary:  The Biden administration, President Biden when he was campaigning said as soon as I become president, we will rejoin the Iran nuclear deal.  The Iranians said the same thing.  We’re now four months into the administration.  Nothing has happened.  Both sides said there seems to be a – something of a stand-off.  And Iran is meanwhile visibly enriching, the very thing people like you warned about when – again, when Joe Biden was campaigning.  Isn’t this a failure of diplomacy?  Shouldn’t you guys have been able to get back into the deal within a week or two?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Two things, Fareed.  First, I think the steps that Iran is taking underscore the urgency of trying to get Iran back into compliance with its obligations under the nuclear deal, the deal that stopped their – the dangerous aspects of their nuclear program, the prospect that they could have fissile material for a nuclear weapon on short order.  We’ve had, I think, five rounds of conversations now, of talks now, indirect in Vienna.  And in fact, our team’s going back to Vienna in the coming days to pursue that.  I think we’ve actually made progress in clarifying what each side needs to do to get back into full compliance.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outstanding question, the question that we don’t have an answer to yet, is whether Iran, at the end of the day, is willing to do what is necessary to come back into compliance with the agreement.  That’s the proposition that we’re testing.  But it’s getting, I think, through these rounds of discussions and talks, clearer and clearer what needs to happen.  The question is:  Is Iran prepared to do it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Well, the Iranians say that that’s actually not what’s happening, what – the United States – the Biden administration has moved the goalposts, that rather than talking about simply both sides getting back to the original deal, doing what was required to comply, the Biden administration is now saying they want to talk about ballistic missiles, they want to talk about regional issues, they want to talk about extending the timeline.  Are you willing to go back to the original deal as it was?  Because the Iranians say they are willing to get back to that tomorrow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Fareed, we’ve been very clear.  We are fully prepared to go back to the original deal as it was.  That’s our initial objective.  And we – again, we don’t know if the Iranians are.  If we do, if we succeed in that, then we can use that as a foundation both to look at how we can make the deal itself potentially longer and stronger, and also engage on these other issues, whether it’s Iran’s support for terrorism, its proliferation, its destabilizing support for different proxies throughout the Middle East. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of that does need to be engaged and something we need to deal with, but we’ve been very clear that from our perspective, the first step needs to be a return to mutual compliance.  That’s what we’re working on and that’s where we still don’t know if Iran is willing to say yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Saudi Arabia says that it now is willing to contemplate better relations with Iran.  Is this a recognition by Saudi Arabia that its strategy so far has not really worked?  Is it a sign that we could see a peace deal in Yemen and we could see an easing of tensions over places like Qatar and Lebanon?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, there needs to be a peace deal in Yemen.  We’re working very hard on that.  We’ve been doing that from day one.  And I think Saudi Arabia has clearly indicated by some of the things that it’s done that it now wants to move in that direction, so that’s very positive.  We need to get the Houthis to come along.  And that, in turn, I think depends significantly on whether Iran is ready to make clear to the Houthis that they need to engage positively and need to resolve this war. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So to the extent that there is a better relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran, that can produce or help produce at least more positive results in ending some of these other conflicts, ending some of these proxy battles, which are incredibly dangerous, incredibly potentially destabilizing, and have a real human toll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  And do you see a shift in Saudi foreign policy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Look, my sense is that, again, on Yemen in particular, where we’ve engaged intensely – we have a senior envoy who is doing this every single day – the Saudis have been engaged productively in trying to bring this war to an end.  We need to see the same kind of response from the Houthis who continue to hold out, and Iran should use the influence it has to move them in that direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Look, we had, I think, a constructive, very businesslike conversation over the course of nearly two hours, but President Biden has been very clear with President Putin, and I repeated what President Biden has said to President Putin, to Foreign Minister Lavrov, and that’s this:  We would prefer to have a more stable, predictable relationship with Russia.  We’ve all got lots of things going on around the world and lots of work that we’re trying to do to make the lives of our citizens a little bit better.  A more stable, predictable relationship with them, I think, would be good for us, good for them, and I’d even argue good for the world.  And there are clearly areas where it’s in our mutual interest to find ways to cooperate, whether it’s on Afghanistan, whether it’s on so-called strategic stability, arms control agreements, whether it’s on dealing with climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But equally clear – and the President has been very resolute on this – if Russia continues to take reckless and aggressive actions aimed at us or aimed at our allies and partners, we will respond, not for purposes of escalating, not to seek conflict, but to defend our interests.  And that was the nature of the conversation that I had with Foreign Minister Lavrov.  It’s really important to be very clear about what you’re doing, why you’re doing it.  And ultimately, it is up to Russia to decide whether it wants to have that more predictable, stable relationship.  We need to test the proposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, thank you for coming on the show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks for having me, Fareed.  It’s great to be with you.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Good morning, Mr. Secretary.  Welcome to This Week.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Thanks, George.  Great to be with you.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Let’s start with the ceasefire.  President Biden pushed it privately, welcomed it publicly.  Both sides are claiming a sort of victory right now, but has anything really changed?  What’s to prevent this cycle of violence from kicking up again, maybe very soon?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Well, first, George, it was critical to get to the ceasefire, and President Biden’s focus on relentless, determined, but quiet diplomacy is what got us to where we needed to be, which is to get the violence ended as quickly as possible, to stop more human suffering, and to at least put ourselves in position to make a turn, to make a pivot to building something more positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That has to start now with dealing with the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, then reconstruction, rebuilding what’s been lost, and, critically, engaging both sides in trying to start to make real improvements in the lives of people so that Israelis and Palestinians can live with equal measures of security, of peace, and of dignity.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  You stress that word “equal” right there.  That seems to be a new emphasis for this administration.  We haven’t heard that a lot in the past, equal rights for Palestinians and Israelis.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Well, it’s vitally important that Palestinians feel hope and have opportunity and can live in security, just as it is for Israelis.  And there should be equal measures.  And in a democratic society, that is, I think, an obligation of the – of any government.  So ultimately, I think that that hope, that security, that dignity can – will be found in a Palestinian state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But meanwhile, we have to do everything we can both to address the immediate situation, which is humanitarian, reconstruction in Gaza, starting to improve people’s lives in a concrete way, and ultimately get to a place where we can get negotiations and move towards something that brings a lasting resolution to the problem.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  You say you still want to work towards a two-state solution, but is that really still possible?  Is there anything constructive the United States can do?  It doesn’t seem like efforts have created much fruit in the past.  And – or is this new emphasis you’re putting on equal rights really the start of a longer-term shift?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  President Biden’s been very clear that he remains committed to a two-state solution.  Look, ultimately, it is the only way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state, and of course, the only way to give the Palestinians the state to which they’re entitled.  That’s where we have to go.  But that, I don’t think, is something for – necessarily for today.  We have to start putting in place the conditions that would allow both sides to engage in a meaningful and positive way toward two states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first instance, we have to deal with making this turn from the violence – we got the ceasefire – and now deal with the humanitarian situation, deal with reconstruction, and deepen our existing engagement with Palestinians and with Israelis alike.  But the most &#8212;</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  The President wants &#8212;</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  I was going to say, George, the most important thing is this:  What I hope that everyone takes from this is that if there isn’t positive change, and particularly if we can’t find a way for – to help Palestinians live with more dignity and with more hope, the cycle’s likely to repeat itself, and that is in no one’s interest.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  You say you want rebuilding; you say you want reconstruction.  The President said he wants to do that without restocking Hamas – rebuilding Gaza without restocking Hamas.  How do you do that?  They’re in charge in Gaza.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Look, we’ve worked in the past and we can continue to work with trusted, independent parties that can help do the reconstruction and the development, not some quasi-governmental authority.  And the fact of the matter is Hamas has brought nothing but ruin to the Palestinian people: its gross mismanagement of Gaza while it’s been in charge, and of course, these indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli civilians, which have elicited the response that they did because Israel has a right to defend itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think what’s the real challenge here is to help the Palestinians, and particularly to help moderate Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority deliver better results for their people.  And of course, Israel has a profound role to play in that too.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  The President reiterated his strong support for Israel on Friday, but he’s coming under increased pressure from progressives.  Bernie Sanders has introduced a resolution of disapproval over a new arms sale to Israel.  Others like Rashida Tlaib and AOC say the U.S. should not be rubber-stamping arms sales to Israel when they use the weapons to abuse Palestinian rights.  What’s your response to that?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Well, happily, George, one of the things I don’t do in this job is I don’t do politics.  I focus on the policy.  So I’ll leave the politics to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But here’s what I can say:  We got to the result thanks to President Biden’s relentless focus on this quiet but, I think, effective diplomacy in getting to a ceasefire and stopping the violence in 11 days.  If you go back and look at previous crises, they’ve lasted a lot longer, but of course, every single day that these things go on, we see a tremendous loss in human life and in human suffering.  And we were determined to get – to bring that to an end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to arms sales, two things.  First, the President’s been equally clear:  We are committed to giving Israel the means to defend itself, especially when it comes to these indiscriminate rocket attacks against civilians.  Any country would respond to that, and we – we’re committed to Israel’s defense.  At the same time, any arms sale is going to be done in full consultation with Congress.  We’re committed to that.  And we want to make sure that that process works effectively.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Your administration’s continuing to pursue nuclear negotiations with Iran, but 42 Republican senators have called on the President to end the negotiations, make it clear that sanctions will remain in place because of Iranian funding of Hamas.  Do you believe that Iran is funding Hamas?  And if they are, should the sanctions stay in place?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  George, Iran is engaged in a number of activities, including funding extremist groups, supporting terrorism more broadly, supporting very dangerous proxies that are taking destabilizing actions throughout the Middle East, proliferating weapons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And two things on that.  One, an Iran with a nuclear weapon or with the capability to build one in very short order is going to act with even greater impunity in those areas, which just adds to the urgency of trying to put the nuclear problem back in the box that the nuclear agreement put it in.  And, of course, many of these actions are going forward now while the – and have gone forward over the last few years under the so-called maximum pressure being exerted by the previous administration, and clearly did not get the result that we all seek, which is to curb all of these activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the first thing that we need to do is put the nuclear problem back in the box.  That’s why we’re committed to trying to see if Iran will come back into compliance with the nuclear agreement, the so-called JCPOA – that’s what we’re engaged in now – and then use that as a platform to build on and to try to deal with these other issues.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  The Iranians say the decision to raise – to lift some of the sanctions has already been made.  Is that true? </span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We’re – we’ve been now over – we’re about to have our, I think, fifth round of discussions in Vienna with the Iranians.  And what these discussions and talks – indirect, as you know – have done is they’ve clarified what each side needs to do in order to come back into compliance.  So we know what sanctions would need to be lifted if they’re inconsistent with the nuclear agreement.  But as important and indeed more important, Iran, I think, knows what it needs to do to come back into compliance on the nuclear side.  And what we haven’t yet seen is whether Iran is ready and willing to make a decision to do what it has to do.  That’s the test and we don’t yet have an answer.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Finally, let’s talk about the North Korea nuclear program.  At his meeting with the South Korean prime minister on Friday, the President said he was prepared to re-engage with the North Koreans under the right conditions.  Right now, the best estimates are that the North Korean nuclear arsenal has doubled in recent years, about 45 weapons right now.  Does the United States have to accept that North Korea will remain a nuclear power?  Do we have to learn to live with a nuclear North Korea?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We don’t and we shouldn’t, but let’s be honest:  This is a hard problem.  Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, have tried to tackle it, and no one’s fully succeeded, to say the least.  In fact, the program has gotten more advanced and more dangerous over time.  And we’ve looked at different approaches that were taken, including basically doing nothing for nothing or trying to do – get everything for everything.  Neither has worked.  We engaged in an intensive review.  We looked at what every previous administration has done.  We consulted very closely with our allies and partners, starting with South Korea and Japan.  I was there with Secretary Austin.  We just had President Moon’s visit.  All of that as well as the view of experts on all sides was factored in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what President Biden determined was the best chance we have to achieve the objective of the total denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is to engage diplomatically with North Korea on a deliberate, calibrated approach where we seek to make progress toward that goal.  I don’t think there’s going to be a grand bargain where this gets resolved in one fell swoop.  It’s got to be clearly calibrated diplomacy, clear steps from the North Koreans, and it moves forward in that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we put that forward.  We’re waiting to see if Pyongyang actually wants to engage.  The ball’s in their court.  We’ve made clear we’re prepared to pursue this diplomatically even as the sanctions remain in place because North Korea continues to engage in activities that are clearly prohibited by the United Nations.  But we’re prepared to do the diplomacy.  The question is:  Is North Korea? </span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Secretary Blinken, thanks for your time this morning.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Thanks, George.  Great to be with you.  </span></p>

<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  You say you still want to work towards a two-state solution, but is that really still possible?  Is there anything constructive the United States can do?  It doesn’t seem like efforts have created much fruit in the past.  And – or is this new emphasis you’re putting on equal rights really the start of a longer-term shift?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  President Biden’s been very clear that he remains committed to a two-state solution.  Look, ultimately, it is the only way to ensure Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state, and of course, the only way to give the Palestinians the state to which they’re entitled.  That’s where we have to go.  But that, I don’t think, is something for – necessarily for today.  We have to start putting in place the conditions that would allow both sides to engage in a meaningful and positive way toward two states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first instance, we have to deal with making this turn from the violence – we got the ceasefire – and now deal with the humanitarian situation, deal with reconstruction, and deepen our existing engagement with Palestinians and with Israelis alike.  But the most &#8212;</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  The President wants &#8212;</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  I was going to say, George, the most important thing is this:  What I hope that everyone takes from this is that if there isn’t positive change, and particularly if we can’t find a way for – to help Palestinians live with more dignity and with more hope, the cycle’s likely to repeat itself, and that is in no one’s interest.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  You say you want rebuilding; you say you want reconstruction.  The President said he wants to do that without restocking Hamas – rebuilding Gaza without restocking Hamas.  How do you do that?  They’re in charge in Gaza.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Look, we’ve worked in the past and we can continue to work with trusted, independent parties that can help do the reconstruction and the development, not some quasi-governmental authority.  And the fact of the matter is Hamas has brought nothing but ruin to the Palestinian people: its gross mismanagement of Gaza while it’s been in charge, and of course, these indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli civilians, which have elicited the response that they did because Israel has a right to defend itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think what’s the real challenge here is to help the Palestinians, and particularly to help moderate Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority deliver better results for their people.  And of course, Israel has a profound role to play in that too.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  The President reiterated his strong support for Israel on Friday, but he’s coming under increased pressure from progressives.  Bernie Sanders has introduced a resolution of disapproval over a new arms sale to Israel.  Others like Rashida Tlaib and AOC say the U.S. should not be rubber-stamping arms sales to Israel when they use the weapons to abuse Palestinian rights.  What’s your response to that?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Well, happily, George, one of the things I don’t do in this job is I don’t do politics.  I focus on the policy.  So I’ll leave the politics to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But here’s what I can say:  We got to the result thanks to President Biden’s relentless focus on this quiet but, I think, effective diplomacy in getting to a ceasefire and stopping the violence in 11 days.  If you go back and look at previous crises, they’ve lasted a lot longer, but of course, every single day that these things go on, we see a tremendous loss in human life and in human suffering.  And we were determined to get – to bring that to an end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to arms sales, two things.  First, the President’s been equally clear:  We are committed to giving Israel the means to defend itself, especially when it comes to these indiscriminate rocket attacks against civilians.  Any country would respond to that, and we – we’re committed to Israel’s defense.  At the same time, any arms sale is going to be done in full consultation with Congress.  We’re committed to that.  And we want to make sure that that process works effectively.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Your administration’s continuing to pursue nuclear negotiations with Iran, but 42 Republican senators have called on the President to end the negotiations, make it clear that sanctions will remain in place because of Iranian funding of Hamas.  Do you believe that Iran is funding Hamas?  And if they are, should the sanctions stay in place?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  George, Iran is engaged in a number of activities, including funding extremist groups, supporting terrorism more broadly, supporting very dangerous proxies that are taking destabilizing actions throughout the Middle East, proliferating weapons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And two things on that.  One, an Iran with a nuclear weapon or with the capability to build one in very short order is going to act with even greater impunity in those areas, which just adds to the urgency of trying to put the nuclear problem back in the box that the nuclear agreement put it in.  And, of course, many of these actions are going forward now while the – and have gone forward over the last few years under the so-called maximum pressure being exerted by the previous administration, and clearly did not get the result that we all seek, which is to curb all of these activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the first thing that we need to do is put the nuclear problem back in the box.  That’s why we’re committed to trying to see if Iran will come back into compliance with the nuclear agreement, the so-called JCPOA – that’s what we’re engaged in now – and then use that as a platform to build on and to try to deal with these other issues.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  The Iranians say the decision to raise – to lift some of the sanctions has already been made.  Is that true? </span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We’re – we’ve been now over – we’re about to have our, I think, fifth round of discussions in Vienna with the Iranians.  And what these discussions and talks – indirect, as you know – have done is they’ve clarified what each side needs to do in order to come back into compliance.  So we know what sanctions would need to be lifted if they’re inconsistent with the nuclear agreement.  But as important and indeed more important, Iran, I think, knows what it needs to do to come back into compliance on the nuclear side.  And what we haven’t yet seen is whether Iran is ready and willing to make a decision to do what it has to do.  That’s the test and we don’t yet have an answer.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Finally, let’s talk about the North Korea nuclear program.  At his meeting with the South Korean prime minister on Friday, the President said he was prepared to re-engage with the North Koreans under the right conditions.  Right now, the best estimates are that the North Korean nuclear arsenal has doubled in recent years, about 45 weapons right now.  Does the United States have to accept that North Korea will remain a nuclear power?  Do we have to learn to live with a nuclear North Korea?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  We don’t and we shouldn’t, but let’s be honest:  This is a hard problem.  Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, have tried to tackle it, and no one’s fully succeeded, to say the least.  In fact, the program has gotten more advanced and more dangerous over time.  And we’ve looked at different approaches that were taken, including basically doing nothing for nothing or trying to do – get everything for everything.  Neither has worked.  We engaged in an intensive review.  We looked at what every previous administration has done.  We consulted very closely with our allies and partners, starting with South Korea and Japan.  I was there with Secretary Austin.  We just had President Moon’s visit.  All of that as well as the view of experts on all sides was factored in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what President Biden determined was the best chance we have to achieve the objective of the total denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is to engage diplomatically with North Korea on a deliberate, calibrated approach where we seek to make progress toward that goal.  I don’t think there’s going to be a grand bargain where this gets resolved in one fell swoop.  It’s got to be clearly calibrated diplomacy, clear steps from the North Koreans, and it moves forward in that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we put that forward.  We’re waiting to see if Pyongyang actually wants to engage.  The ball’s in their court.  We’ve made clear we’re prepared to pursue this diplomatically even as the sanctions remain in place because North Korea continues to engage in activities that are clearly prohibited by the United Nations.  But we’re prepared to do the diplomacy.  The question is:  Is North Korea? </span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Secretary Blinken, thanks for your time this morning.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Thanks, George.  Great to be with you.  </span></p>

<p>The United States supports the recommendations of the African Union Peace and Security Council regarding Chad, and we join the African Union and our international partners in calling for a peaceful, timely, and civilian-led transition of power to a democratically elected government before October 2022.</p>
<p>The Chadian people deserve an inclusive national dialogue where all stakeholders can come together to decide the future of their country. Chad’s political transition should include a new national constitution, a concrete plan and timeline for elections, and support for strong institutions such as a representative National Assembly, an independent judicial system, and a reformed National Independent Electoral Commission. A representative, democratically elected government is the best path to long-term prosperity and stability in Chad and the region.</p>
<p>The United States has long stood with the people of Chad in advocating for democratic, representative government, and we will continue to support the people of Chad, the African Union, and our international partners in advocating for a timely transition to elected, civilian government.</p>
