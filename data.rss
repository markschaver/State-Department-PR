					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State is announcing the launch of a new Conflict Observatory to capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.  The program encompasses the documentation, verification, and dissemination of open-source evidence regarding the actions of Russia’s forces during President Putin’s brutal war of choice.  The Conflict Observatory will analyze and preserve publicly and commercially available information, including satellite imagery and information shared via social media, consistent with international legal standards, for use in ongoing and future accountability mechanisms.  This includes maintaining rigorous chain-of-custody procedures for future civil and criminal legal processes under appropriate jurisdictions.  An online platform will publicly share the Conflict Observatory’s documentation to help refute Russia’s disinformation efforts and shine a light on abuses.</p>
<p>This program is being established with an initial $6 million investment, with future funding to come from the European Democratic Resilience Initiative (EDRI).  In March, the White House announced at least $320 million in funds for EDRI to bolster democratic resilience, advance anti-corruption efforts, and promote respect for human rights in Ukraine and its region.  This new Conflict Observatory program is part of a range of U.S. government efforts at both national and international levels designed to ensure future accountability for Russia’s horrific actions.</p>
<p>The Conflict Observatory is a collaborative endeavor with Esri, a leading geographic information systems company, Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab, the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative, and PlanetScape Ai.  The U.S. government has also contributed commercial satellite imagery to these efforts.  We expect other international partner organizations to join as the program proceeds.  Reports and analyses will be available online through the ConflictObservatory.org website.</p>
<p>The Conflict Observatory is a further demonstration of the United States’ steadfast support for the people of Ukraine as they valiantly defend their country and their freedom in response to President Putin’s premeditated, unjustified, and unprovoked war.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States affirms today, on the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia, and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT), that the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons are the same human rights to which all persons are entitled. As enshrined in Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, “ll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”</p>
<p>Too many LGBTQI+ persons live under the shadow of discrimination, violence, and fear. Global data makes clear that the dehumanization of LGBTQI+ persons is systemic, pervasive, and often violent.  Homophobia, biphobia, interphobia, and transphobia are deeply entrenched in societies across the world, including here in the United States.  Countless persons are at extreme risk for being themselves.</p>
<p>We remain committed to ending this intolerance. Everyone deserves to live with respect, dignity, and safety.  The United States affirms that all LGBTQI+ individuals, couples, and their families are valid and valuable.  In line with commitments made at President Biden’s Summit for Democracy and resulting Year of Action, we will continue to support reforms to yield a world free from discrimination and violence, so that all of our LGBTQI+ friends, colleagues, neighbors, and family may live freely with dignity and equal respect for their human rights.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I congratulate the Norwegian people as you celebrate Constitution Day.  This year, I also send a hearty congratulations for setting a new record for the largest number of gold medals won by a single country at a Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>As Norwegians celebrate their Constitution of 1814, Americans are reminded of the cherished democratic values that our two countries share that bind us together.  The close relationship between our two nations stems in part from waves of Norwegian emigration to the United States from 1825 to 1940, giving the United States today nearly as many people of Norwegian ancestry as the population of Norway.  The United States and Norway have been NATO Allies for more than 70 years, and we stand together in our shared commitment to freedom, collective security, and human rights.  As Allies, we defend against threats to democratic values and address global challenges.  The United States appreciates the close coordination with Norway as we respond to the actions of regimes that seek to repress fundamental freedoms and undermine the international rules-based order.  This coordination is all the more important as we work together to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine.  As partners, we will deepen our collaboration to combat the climate crisis and strengthen our vibrant people-to-people ties in the years to come.</p>
<p>I join you in celebrating this anniversary and send best wishes for health and prosperity to all Norwegians.  Gratulerer med dagen!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States is designating Attorney General of Guatemala Maria Consuelo Porras Argueta de Porres (“Porras”) due to her involvement in significant corruption.  During her tenure, Porras repeatedly obstructed and undermined anticorruption investigations in Guatemala to protect her political allies and gain undue political favor.  Porras’s pattern of obstruction includes reportedly ordering prosecutors in Guatemala’s Public Ministry to ignore cases based on political considerations and firing prosecutors who investigate cases involving acts of corruption.</p>
<p>This public designation is made under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2022. Under this authority, designated officials of foreign governments involved in significant corruption and their immediate family members are ineligible for entry into the United States.  The Department is also designating Porras’s husband Gilberto de Jesus Porres de Paz.  The designation follows Porras’s September 2021 inclusion on the list of corrupt and undemocratic actors submitted to the U.S. Congress under Section 353 of the United States – Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act. The Department is actively considering additional designations under Section 353, including making new designations public at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>These designations reaffirm the commitment of the United States to combat corruption, which undermines the Guatemalan people’s faith in their democratic institutions.  The United States continues to stand with all Guatemalans in support of democracy and the rule of law and against those who would undermine these principles for personal gain.</p>

<p>The United States congratulates the people of Somalia on the conclusion of their national electoral process. We also congratulate Hassan Sheikh Mohamud on his election as the president of the Federal Republic of Somalia and look forward to working closely with him and the new government.</p>
<p>With the conclusion of this process, Somalia now has an opportunity to focus on the political, economic, and security reforms necessary to advance the interests of the people of Somalia. We encourage President Hassan Sheikh and all of Somalia’s leaders to prioritize strengthening democratic governance and institutions; developing security forces to prevent and counter terrorism and assume full security responsibility from the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia; enacting economic reforms to complete Somalia’s path to debt relief and strengthen the economy; and facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid to the millions of Somalis suffering from devastating drought.  Reconciliation, compromise, and enhanced dialogue among all levels of government and all communities will be vital to the success of these efforts.</p>
<p>The United States looks forward to the timely formation of a new government and partnering with Somalia’s leaders to achieve our shared goal of a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous Somalia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Administration’s policy towards Cuba continues to focus first and foremost on support for the Cuban people, including their human rights and their political and economic well-being.</p>
<p>Today, the Administration announced measures to further support the Cuban people, providing them additional tools to pursue a life free from Cuban government oppression and to seek greater economic opportunities.</p>
<p>We will reinstate the Cuban Family Reunification Parole (CFRP) Program and further increase consular services and visa processing, making it possible for more Cubans to join their families in the United States via regular migration channels.</p>
<p>We will make it easier for families to visit their relatives in Cuba and for authorized U.S. travelers to engage with the Cuban people, attend meetings, and conduct research.</p>
<p>We will encourage the growth of Cuba’s private sector by supporting greater access to U.S. Internet services, applications, and e-commerce platforms.  We will support new avenues for electronic payments and for U.S. business activities with independent Cuban entrepreneurs, including through increased access to microfinance and training.</p>
<p>We also will support Cuban families and entrepreneurs by enabling increased remittance flows to the Cuban people in ways that do not enrich human rights abusers.  We will lift the family remittance cap of $1,000 per quarter and will support donative remittances to Cuban entrepreneurs, both with the goal of further empowering families to support each other and for entrepreneurs to expand their businesses.</p>
<p>With these actions, we aim to support Cubans’ aspirations for freedom and for greater economic opportunities so that they can lead successful lives at home.  We continue to call on the Cuban government to immediately release political prisoners, to respect the Cuban people’s fundamental freedoms and to allow the Cuban people to determine their own futures.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today, the United States is taking a series of measures to increase support for the Cuban people in line with our national security interests.  The Cuban people are confronting an unprecedented humanitarian crisis — and our policy will continue to focus on empowering the Cuban people to help them create a future free from repression and economic suffering.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Administration will:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Facilitate family reunification by reinstating the Cuban Family Reunification Parole (CFRP) Program </b>and continuing to increase capacity for consular services. Limited immigrant visa processing resumed in Havana on May 3, 2022. We will reinstate the CFRP and increase visa processing in Havana while continuing to process the majority of immigrant visa cases at the U.S. Embassy in Georgetown, Guyana.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strengthen family ties and facilitate educational connections for the U.S. and Cuban people by expanding authorized travel in support of the Cuban people. </b>We will authorize scheduled and charter flights to locations beyond Havana. We also will implement regulatory changes to reinstate group people-to-people and other categories of group educational travel, as well as certain travel related to professional meetings and professional research, including to support expanded Internet access and remittance processing companies and to provide additional support to Cuban entrepreneurs. We are not reinstating individual people-to-people travel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Increase support for independent Cuban entrepreneurs. </b>We will encourage commercial opportunities outside of the state sector by authorizing access to expanded cloud technology, application programming interfaces, and e-commerce platforms. We will explore options to expand support of additional payment options for Internet-based activities, electronic payments, and business with independent Cuban entrepreneurs. We will work to expand entrepreneurs’ access to microfinance and training.<b> </b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Ensure that remittances flow more freely to the Cuban people while not enriching those who perpetrate human rights abuses. </b>Specifically, we will remove the current limit on family remittances of $1,000 per quarter per sender-receiver pair and will authorize donative (i.e., non-family) remittances, which will support independent Cuban entrepreneurs. We will engage with electronic payment processors to encourage increased Cuban market accessibility. We will not remove entities from the Cuba Restricted List.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Administration is working expeditiously to effectuate these changes, which will be implemented via steps taken and regulatory changes made by relevant Departments and Agencies in short order.</p>

We also will implement regulatory changes to reinstate group people-to-people and other categories of group educational travel, as well as certain travel related to professional meetings and professional research, including to support expanded Internet access and remittance processing companies and to provide additional support to Cuban entrepreneurs. We are not reinstating individual people-to-people travel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Increase support for independent Cuban entrepreneurs. </b>We will encourage commercial opportunities outside of the state sector by authorizing access to expanded cloud technology, application programming interfaces, and e-commerce platforms. We will explore options to expand support of additional payment options for Internet-based activities, electronic payments, and business with independent Cuban entrepreneurs. We will work to expand entrepreneurs’ access to microfinance and training.<b> </b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Ensure that remittances flow more freely to the Cuban people while not enriching those who perpetrate human rights abuses. </b>Specifically, we will remove the current limit on family remittances of $1,000 per quarter per sender-receiver pair and will authorize donative (i.e., non-family) remittances, which will support independent Cuban entrepreneurs. We will engage with electronic payment processors to encourage increased Cuban market accessibility. We will not remove entities from the Cuba Restricted List.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Administration is working expeditiously to effectuate these changes, which will be implemented via steps taken and regulatory changes made by relevant Departments and Agencies in short order.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State works to protect sea turtles around the world through its certification program, which allows for the importation of wild-caught shrimp into the United States, pursuant to Section 609 of Public Law 101-162 (“Section 609”).  Each year, the Secretary of State (or his delegate) certifies to Congress those governments and authorities of shrimp-harvesting nations and economies that have programs to reduce the incidental taking of sea turtles in shrimp trawl fisheries that are comparable to the United States, or that their particular fishing environments do not pose a threat of the incidental taking of sea turtles.</p>
<p>This year, the Department certified 37 nations and one economy, and granted determinations for thirteen fisheries as having adequate measures in place to protect sea turtles while harvesting wild-caught shrimp.  Annual certifications and determinations are based in part on overseas verification visits by a team composed of Department of State and NOAA Fisheries representatives.</p>
<p>Six of the world’s seven species of marine turtles are listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act.  The U.S. government is currently providing technology and capacity-building assistance to other nations to help them meet the standard for certification under Section 609 and to contribute to the recovery of sea turtle species.  The U.S. government also encourages legislation like Section 609 in other nations to prevent the importation of shrimp harvested in a manner harmful to protected sea turtles.</p>
<p>For more information on the Certification to Congress, please see the Federal Register Notice published on May 13, 2022, 87 FR 29425.  For more information on U.S. government sea turtle conservation efforts, please visit the websites of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-economic-growth-energy-and-the-environment/bureau-of-oceans-and-international-environmental-and-scientific-affairs/office-of-marine-conservation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA1MTYuNTc5OTQxNDEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZS5nb3YvYnVyZWF1cy1vZmZpY2VzL3VuZGVyLXNlY3JldGFyeS1mb3ItZWNvbm9taWMtZ3Jvd3RoLWVuZXJneS1hbmQtdGhlLWVudmlyb25tZW50L2J1cmVhdS1vZi1vY2VhbnMtYW5kLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1hbmQtc2NpZW50aWZpYy1hZmZhaXJzL29mZmljZS1vZi1tYXJpbmUtY29uc2VydmF0aW9uLyJ9.C8Zk70GiAXThXsLvlPx4-0DedytCWJGEgGee7WbtGkk/s/1006560560/br/131397711345-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1652823014709000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3TqC7HRVaoiTXbxQ0hJy9F">State Department’s Office of Marine Conservation</a>, the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/sea-turtles" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>, and the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.fws.gov/program/international-affairs" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">Fish and Wildlife Service</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>
