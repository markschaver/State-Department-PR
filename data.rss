					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will travel to Rabat, Morocco from March 28 to 30, where he will meet with Prime Minister Aziz Akhanouch and Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita to exchange views on regional political issues and bilateral cooperation.  The Secretary will also engage with Moroccan civil society leaders and participate in a media engagement.</p>
<p><strong>A DEEP AND LASTING RELATIONSHIP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> The long-standing relationship between Morocco and the United States dates back to the Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1787 when Morocco became the first nation to recognize the United States.  The strategic bilateral partnership between the United States and Morocco is rooted in shared interests in regional peace, security, and prosperity.  We welcome Morocco’s role in promoting regional stability, prosperity, and the historic normalization of relations with Israel.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This month, we begin the final year of the five-year, $460 million compact administered by the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation. Together, the United States and Morocco are expanding education and employment opportunities for young people across the Kingdom, as well as land productivity and land rights for women in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXPANDING THE ABRAHAM ACCORDS AND NORMALIZATION AGREEMENTS</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over the past year, the Morocco-Israel diplomatic relationship has blossomed with the historic re-opening of the Israeli liaison office in Rabat. This past year also witnessed the first visit since normalization of relations by senior Israeli officials to Morocco, including Foreign Minister Lapid, along with direct commercial flights operating between Casablanca and Tel Aviv.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Expanding the circle of peace to advance prosperity and security between Israel and other countries in the Middle East, South Asia, and beyond will remain a priority for the United States.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BILATERAL AND REGIONAL POLITICAL ISSUES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The United States is committed to expanding areas of bilateral cooperation with Morocco. To broaden those ties and explore future U.S.-Moroccan cooperation, Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman and Moroccan Foreign Minister Bourita held bilateral political consultations in Rabat earlier this month and co-chaired a session of the Morocco-U.S. Strategic Dialogue on Regional Political Issues.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The United States recognizes the role played by Morocco in maintaining regional security and stability as well as its contribution to peace and prosperity in the Middle East.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The United States and Morocco regularly engage on human rights issues, including advancing freedoms of expression and association, criminal justice reforms, women’s rights and gender equality, and government transparency.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The United States and Morocco are committed to continuing cooperation on issues of common interest, such as regional peace and prosperity and regional security. The United States and Morocco expressed their intent during the strategic dialogue to continue strong counterterrorism cooperation, including against AQIM and ISIS.  We appreciate Morocco as a stable security-exporting partner, for its leadership of the Global Counterterrorism Forum and for its sustaining role in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, including by co-chairing the Africa Focus Group of the Coalition and hosting the upcoming Ministerial Meeting of the Coalition in May.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bilateral relationship includes close collaboration on a range of issues, including the Sahel, Libya, and Ukraine.  We reaffirm the importance of respecting the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and national unity of all the Member States of the United Nations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Unites States welcomes Morocco’s efforts to support the UN’s work on the political process in Libya and hosting the intra-Libyan dialogue.  We are united in our strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and national unity of Libya and the priority for organizing national elections in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>S. and Moroccan military officials have started planning already for this year’s African Lion, the largest military exercise in Africa and a critical component for the U.S.-Morocco security partnership. The 2021 exercise, which took place in June across the Kingdom, was the largest since the annual training event started in 2004.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WESTERN SAHARA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The United States continues to view Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as serious, credible, and realistic, and one potential approach to meet the aspirations of the people of Western Sahara.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Unites States supports United Nations Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura in leading the political process for Western Sahara, under the auspices of the United Nations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>COVID-19 RESPONSE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. government has invested nearly $20 million in Morocco’s COVID-19 pandemic response.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We have worked with the Ministry of Health and other partners to raise awareness about COVID-19 risks, train healthcare workers, study vaccine effectiveness, enhance Morocco’s vaccine cold chain, and provide hygiene and laboratory equipment and supplies.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. military has donated a $1.5 million field hospital that will help combat infectious disease outbreaks in Morocco and recently donated a field Intensive Care Unit (ICU) system ($1 million) and a mobile emergency room annex ($700,000)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Morocco has received 2.45 million doses of Pfizer vaccine from the U.S. contribution to COVAX, a global initiative aimed at ensuring equitable vaccine distribution, in the last several months, as well as more than 300,000 doses of the J&amp;J vaccine earlier in 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CLIMATE CHANGE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both Morocco and the United States understand the critical importance of working together to tackle the climate crisis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Kingdom should be applauded for its recognized leadership in climate action.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One of Morocco’s greatest climate-related concerns is water shortage, due to projections of reduced precipitation and increased drought.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Morocco is a leader in renewable energy transformation and climate action. Renewable energies now account for an impressive 45 percent of all electricity production.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Morocco’s commitment to reach 52 percent of generated renewable energy capacity by 2025 is impressive and the world should take note. In addition, Morocco is considering matching the U.S. government’s commitment to net zero carbon by 2050.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Ramallah, the West Bank </p>
<p>Muqata’a </p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT ABBAS: </strong>(Via interpreter)  In the name of God, the merciful, it gives me great pleasure to welcome U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in his visit to Palestine.  This was an opportunity for me to inform him of the recent developments here.  We also extended the thanks of the – to the administration for the support it provides to the Palestinian people, especially the UNRWA.</p>
<p>We would like to assert at the outset that the priority should always be towards finding a political solution that would end the Israeli occupation of the land of Palestine along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, and to resolve all permanent status issues, including the issues of the refugees and the release of all prisoners under the supervision and sponsorship of the Quartet and according to the – to international resolutions.</p>
<p>We would also like to stress that the state of Palestine abides by international law and all signed agreements, and is – also adheres to the path of peaceful popular resistance and working with the other countries and with the U.S. in – on combating terrorism in our region and the world.  On the other hand, we also stress the importance of the implementation of what the administration of President Biden believes in, which is its belief in a two-state solution and the putting an end to settlements and the violence of settlers, and maintaining the historical status in al-Aqsa Mosque and preventing unilateral actions inside, and also the reopening of the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, and the annulment of all American laws that consider the PLO a terrorist organization inciting violence.</p>
<p>The latest incidents in Europe have proven that there are double standards being flagrantly observed around the world.  For in spite of the crimes of the Israeli occupation that have reached a stage of ethnic cleansing and racial discrimination, as conceded by human rights organizations, and its continuous aggression against sanctities and a lack of respect for international law, we don’t find any party that would hold Israel accountable for its actions as it acts as a state above all law.  And the continuation of these Israeli unilateral actions will lead in the near future to a decision by the Palestinian central committee that would be implemented soon.  What is happening in Palestine is something that we cannot be silent about, and international law cannot be partitioned or divided.  And we here ask again, is it possible for the Israeli occupation authorities’ domination over the Palestinian people and the usurpation of its legitimate rights and dignity – can this continue without any other measures being taken in order to end this occupation?</p>
<p>So in conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Palestinian people for the success of the local elections that were held yesterday in an atmosphere of democracy.  And we had hoped that these elections were – could have happened also or taken place in Gaza Strip, but Hamas agreement with that, in spite of Hamas’s participation in elections in the West Bank.  We would like to express our sadness also for Israel’s prevention of the conduct of the presidential and legislative elections in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary, once again I welcome you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Mr. President, thank you.  Thank you for your hospitality and for the good exchange.  The United States is committed to rebuilding our relationship with the Palestinian Authority and with the Palestinian people.  We’ve been focused on concrete ways to help improve the lives of Palestinians.  That includes: rejoining UNRWA, half a billion dollars in humanitarian assistance since April of last year, and economic support to the Palestinian private sector, to small businesses, job training for young people, and support for food-insecure families in the West Bank and in Gaza.</p>
<p>But this support is more than simply economic.  We’re focused on advancing Palestinian civil and human rights, supporting civil society.  Indeed, I just met, as I think you know, with civil society leaders in East Jerusalem.  They are part of an incredibly rich mosaic that makes up the city.  With them, and here as well with the president and his team, we talked about the importance of responsive, responsible governance.  And at the heart of all of this is an ongoing, enduring commitment to the basic principle of the two-state solution.  Palestinians and Israelis alike deserve to live with equal measures of freedom, of opportunity, security, of dignity, and we believe that the most effective way, ultimately, to give expression to that basic principle is through two states.</p>
<p>Of course, the two sides are very far apart, so we’ll continue our work, step by step, to try to bring them closer.  We’ll work to prevent actions by either side that could raise tensions.  That includes settlement expansion, settler violence, home demolitions, evictions, payments to people convicted of terrorism, incitements to violence.  And today we also emphasized the imperative of having a peaceful Ramadan, Easter, Passover, all of which come together in a month’s time.</p>
<p>Mr. President, again I appreciate the opportunity to discuss all of this with you.  I’m grateful for your hospitality.  And we will continue to work together for the advancement of the lives and livelihoods of the Palestinian people.  We’re committed to that.</p>

<p>We would also like to stress that the state of Palestine abides by international law and all signed agreements, and is – also adheres to the path of peaceful popular resistance and working with the other countries and with the U.S. in – on combating terrorism in our region and the world.  On the other hand, we also stress the importance of the implementation of what the administration of President Biden believes in, which is its belief in a two-state solution and the putting an end to settlements and the violence of settlers, and maintaining the historical status in al-Aqsa Mosque and preventing unilateral actions inside, and also the reopening of the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, and the annulment of all American laws that consider the PLO a terrorist organization inciting violence.</p>
<p>The latest incidents in Europe have proven that there are double standards being flagrantly observed around the world.  For in spite of the crimes of the Israeli occupation that have reached a stage of ethnic cleansing and racial discrimination, as conceded by human rights organizations, and its continuous aggression against sanctities and a lack of respect for international law, we don’t find any party that would hold Israel accountable for its actions as it acts as a state above all law.  And the continuation of these Israeli unilateral actions will lead in the near future to a decision by the Palestinian central committee that would be implemented soon.  What is happening in Palestine is something that we cannot be silent about, and international law cannot be partitioned or divided.  And we here ask again, is it possible for the Israeli occupation authorities’ domination over the Palestinian people and the usurpation of its legitimate rights and dignity – can this continue without any other measures being taken in order to end this occupation?</p>
<p>So in conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Palestinian people for the success of the local elections that were held yesterday in an atmosphere of democracy.  And we had hoped that these elections were – could have happened also or taken place in Gaza Strip, but Hamas agreement with that, in spite of Hamas’s participation in elections in the West Bank.  We would like to express our sadness also for Israel’s prevention of the conduct of the presidential and legislative elections in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary, once again I welcome you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Mr. President, thank you.  Thank you for your hospitality and for the good exchange.  The United States is committed to rebuilding our relationship with the Palestinian Authority and with the Palestinian people.  We’ve been focused on concrete ways to help improve the lives of Palestinians.  That includes: rejoining UNRWA, half a billion dollars in humanitarian assistance since April of last year, and economic support to the Palestinian private sector, to small businesses, job training for young people, and support for food-insecure families in the West Bank and in Gaza.</p>
<p>But this support is more than simply economic.  We’re focused on advancing Palestinian civil and human rights, supporting civil society.  Indeed, I just met, as I think you know, with civil society leaders in East Jerusalem.  They are part of an incredibly rich mosaic that makes up the city.  With them, and here as well with the president and his team, we talked about the importance of responsive, responsible governance.  And at the heart of all of this is an ongoing, enduring commitment to the basic principle of the two-state solution.  Palestinians and Israelis alike deserve to live with equal measures of freedom, of opportunity, security, of dignity, and we believe that the most effective way, ultimately, to give expression to that basic principle is through two states.</p>
<p>Of course, the two sides are very far apart, so we’ll continue our work, step by step, to try to bring them closer.  We’ll work to prevent actions by either side that could raise tensions.  That includes settlement expansion, settler violence, home demolitions, evictions, payments to people convicted of terrorism, incitements to violence.  And today we also emphasized the imperative of having a peaceful Ramadan, Easter, Passover, all of which come together in a month’s time.</p>
<p>Mr. President, again I appreciate the opportunity to discuss all of this with you.  I’m grateful for your hospitality.  And we will continue to work together for the advancement of the lives and livelihoods of the Palestinian people.  We’re committed to that.</p>

<p>Jerusalem</p>
<p>The David Citadel</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR NIDES:</strong>  Welcome, everybody.  Thank you all for coming.  This is a spectacular day.  Not only do I have my friend, a phenomenal Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, but this program is one of the highlights of this administration, which is the Nita Lowey Fund, which allows and has given and granted – Nita Lowey was a member of Congress who was a friend both of mine and the Secretary’s, and this was named after her – $250 million which will be going to partnerships.</p>
<p>But I want to just take a second to have Aler – are you there, Aler?</p>
<p><strong>MS GRUBBS:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR NIDES:</strong>  Who runs the USAID mission here in Israel and has done a spectacular job, to introduce the Secretary.  Aler.</p>
<p><strong>MS GRUBBS:</strong>  Good afternoon, and thank you to mark this event on the Nita Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act, which is also known as MEPPA.  And through MEPPA, this represents the United States commitment to supporting an eventual two-state solution and peaceful coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis.  The MEPPA will support building economic bridges between Palestinians and Israelis, as well as supporting people-to-people peace building.</p>
<p>On March 8th, the U.S. Government announced the first two grants under MEPPA, and it is a great honor to welcome the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken here today to make another announcement on MEPPA.  Please.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you so much.  Well, Tom, thank you so much.  First of all, I just want to say how grateful we are to be working every single day with USAID because what I see around the world is extraordinary work that AID is doing, and no more so than with this project with the State Department because it is literally bringing people and bringing communities together to meet shared challenges and to discover in the process that, ultimately, they have a lot more in common than separates them.  And that is the power of the MEPPA program.  It’s the power of the work that we’re doing, and with the grants that are being awarded, including one that will go to dealing with a common challenge faced by Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs alike, and that is water scarcity.</p>
<p>So in this way and so many other ways, through practical cooperation, bringing people together, it builds habits of cooperation and breaks down barriers in ways that ultimately, I think, will help set the foundation for what we continue to believe is the necessary and important future of two states.</p>
<p>So it’s an honor to be here today.  It’s an honor to see this get off the ground.  And I wish you all very good luck in actually pursuing this project.  Congratulations, as well.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Jerusalem </p>
<p>Prime Minister’s Office</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:  </strong>Secretary of State, Tony, it’s a pleasure to have you here in Jerusalem, and, my friend, welcome.  We had a very meaningful meeting and I think we learned a lot one from another, and we were in sync.</p>
<p>Today is a historic day.  We’re hosting the Negev Summit here in Israel, where the foreign ministers of Egypt, the UAE, Morocco, Bahrain will gather together with Israel and the United States in Sde Boker, southern Israel, for this momentous occasion.  I’d like to convey my thanks to you, Secretary of State Blinken, and to Israel’s foreign minister, my friend Yair Lapid, for the important parts you’re playing in this summit.</p>
<p>The Middle East is changing, and it’s changing for the better.  We’re cultivating old ties and building new bridges.  We’re rejuvenating old peace and charging it with the new energy of the Abraham Accords.  We’re working together to overcome the old forces of darkness and build a new future that’s better, brighter, and promising.  And I want to thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your personal commitment to the Abraham Accords and for your continued efforts to grow, nurture, and further expand this important regional partnership.</p>
<p>Israel’s doors are as open as ever, as you’ve seen.  In a turbulent world, Israel is a force for peace, prosperity, stability, and for doing good.  That’s what we’re about: to be strong here and do good.  And unfortunately, there are other forces in the region that are still violent and destructive.  As I just shared with you in the meeting, we’re concerned about the intention to delist the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.  Their proxy, the Houthis, just this weekend carried out a horrific attack on Saudi Arabia.  I hope the United States will hear the concerned voices from the region, Israel’s and others’, on this very important issue.</p>
<p>On a different note, this week, the end of the week, the holy month of Ramadan will begin, and our government is working very hard to improve the lives of the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza.  Just earlier today, my cabinet approved 20,000 workers from Gaza to be able to work in Israel.  We’re going to be investing almost 40 million shekel in improving the crossings between Israel and Gaza Strip to allow smooth and a dignified movement between Gaza and Israel.  While we can’t solve everything, we can improve the lives of people on ground, and thanks to your help, this is happening; it’s materializing.  So even if you can’t solve everything, it doesn’t mean you don’t do anything.</p>
<p>As for the war in Ukraine, Israel stands firm with the people of Ukraine and is going to continue our effort to help reduce the suffering and end the bloodshed.  We’ve already sent our top medical teams to set up the most advanced field hospital inside Ukraine, on the western side.  I’ve been reported that they’re already taken care and treated over 500 patients.  At this moment, at this very moment, doctors and nurses are risking their lives to save lives of those in need.  I’m proud of what Israel is doing.</p>
<p>And of course, we’re doing what we can, when asked, to contribute to the efforts to end this war.  We do this while maintaining close coordination with the United States and with our European partners.</p>
<p>Tony, please, send my gratitude to President Biden for his friendship and for keeping his promise regarding the Iron Dome, which saves lives.  Israel greatly appreciates America’s commitment to our security.  The alliance between the United States and Israel is as strong as ever, and though we may have our differences, as friends do, it remains unbreakable.  Thank you and have a productive visit here in Israel.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you so much for this really, more than good, very productive exchange between us, which I deeply appreciate; so does my whole team.  We covered a lot of ground in our discussion, and I want to highlight, if I can, a couple of the issues.</p>
<p>But first, a point of personal privilege.  It is particularly great to have our new ambassador here, Tom Nides.  He’s a close friend of mine, a longtime colleague, but more important than that, he’s a good friend of President Biden and is deeply committed to the relationship between Israel and the United States.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Yeah, he’s okay.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, now, I will say – I’ve said this to Tom – I think we got the better &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We got the better end of the bargain because we have Mike Herzog.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Right.  There you go.  Wonderful ambassadors.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  You mentioned this, Prime Minister.  Last August, when the prime minister visited the White House, President Biden made clear America and our administration’s ironclad commitment to Israel’s security.  It’s something we say, but it’s also something that we do and that I reaffirmed today.</p>
<p>President Biden, in that meeting, promised his full support for replenishing Israel’s Iron Dome, and he delivered on that pledge, signing a funding bill that includes $1 billion for this crucial defense system just some days ago.</p>
<p>We also share and we are united in addressing the challenges posed by Iran, including its nuclear program.  And there is no daylight between us on the fundamental proposition that Iran must never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.  And whether there is a return to the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear agreement, or not, that principle will not change nor will our commitment to it.</p>
<p>I had a chance to update the prime minister on the ongoing diplomatic efforts around the JCPOA, as we’ve done consistently with our Israeli partners, and as we’ll continue to do.  And deal or no deal, we will continue to work together and with other partners  to counter Iran’s destabilizing behavior in the region, as indeed we’ve seen most recently in the Houthi attacks against civilian infrastructure in the United Arab Emirates and in Saudi Arabia – acts of terrorism enabled by Iran.</p>
<p>I thanked the prime minister for his diplomatic efforts, important diplomatic efforts, to end the Russian Government’s aggression against Ukraine.  We value these efforts and we’ve been closely coordinated throughout.  It’s important, and your insights as well are very meaningful, so I thank you for that.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We appreciate all efforts by allies and partners to stop the catastrophic suffering that Russia’s aggression is causing for the people in Ukraine.  And I have to say, we’re also grateful for the Israeli Government’s efforts to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine – including more than 100 tons of food, medicine, generators, other vital supplies, and the field hospital.  I had a chance earlier today when I was with Foreign Minister Lapid to actually connect directly with those who are running the field hospital.  We did it virtually, and it was very powerful to see that in action.</p>
<p>This support is crucial as more and more Ukrainian men, women, and children are being killed, maimed, displaced by Moscow’s attacks; more are trapped in barbaric sieges, where they are denied food, water, medicine; and where people are starving.  Fully half the children in Ukraine have been displaced by Russia’s aggression.  Half the children in the country.</p>
<p>I also made clear the conviction that the United States has that Israelis and Palestinians deserve to enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, and dignity.  And that’s one of the principal reasons we support a negotiated two-state solution.</p>
<p>The prime minister and his government have made important efforts to address some of the challenges facing Palestinians, increasing Israeli water sales to Gaza, granting permits now to 20,000 people from Gaza to work in Israel, legalizing the status of thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank.  And we very much hope to see more efforts along these lines in the near term.</p>
<p>We’re also encouraged to see members of the prime minister’s cabinet meeting with Palestinian leaders – including Defense Minister Ganz, whom I’ll see in a short while.</p>
<p>Our administration is also rebuilding America’s relationship with the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people, something I’ll continue to do today in Ramallah with President Abbas, and in East Jerusalem with leaders of that community’s vibrant and diverse civil society.  We’re increasing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people, totaling half a billion dollars since April 2021.</p>
<p>Today, we also discussed ways to foster a peaceful Passover, Ramadan, and Easter across Israel, and Gaza and the West Bank, particularly in Jerusalem, a city of such profound importance to Jews, to Christians, to Muslims.</p>
<p>And that means working to prevent actions on all sides that could raise tensions, including settlement expansion, settler violence, incitement to violence, demolitions, payments to individuals convicted of terrorism, evictions of families from homes they’ve lived in for decades – it’s a message that I’ll be underscoring in all of my meetings on this trip.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are increasing our efforts to foster partnerships between Palestinian and Israeli grassroots organizations, businesses, young people, other parts of society, through a five-year, $250 million Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act.</p>
<p>Right after this, in fact, I will have a chance to meet with one of the program’s first grantees – a project that brings together groups in Gaza, the West Bank, and Israel to tackle the interconnected problem of water scarcity.  Efforts like this will not only improve people’s lives, but build relationships that can help defuse tension and violence, and ultimately, lay a foundation for dialogue and for peace.</p>
<p>Finally, as the prime minister said, we discussed how we can continue to build on the significant progress of the Abraham Accords and normalization – including in the summit starting this evening, the Negev.  The United States will continue not only to support and to work with those who already normalized relations, but also to urge more governments to take this important step – to the benefit of people in their countries and far beyond.</p>
<p>Mr. Prime Minister, your recent trilateral summit with President al-Sisi and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed as well as President Herzog’s visit to Turkey for meetings with President Erdogan and others – these are just the latest demonstrations of broader engagement that is made possible as normalization becomes the new normal throughout the region.  And again, I applaud Israel’s leadership, its engagement, its diplomacy in building these agreements and making them real.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for hosting us today – and again, for such a constructive, important exchange on everything we’ve just talked about and more.  And thank you for continuing to strengthen what is an enduring and powerful friendship between Israel and the United States.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Thank you.</p>

<p>I thanked the prime minister for his diplomatic efforts, important diplomatic efforts, to end the Russian Government’s aggression against Ukraine.  We value these efforts and we’ve been closely coordinated throughout.  It’s important, and your insights as well are very meaningful, so I thank you for that.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We appreciate all efforts by allies and partners to stop the catastrophic suffering that Russia’s aggression is causing for the people in Ukraine.  And I have to say, we’re also grateful for the Israeli Government’s efforts to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine – including more than 100 tons of food, medicine, generators, other vital supplies, and the field hospital.  I had a chance earlier today when I was with Foreign Minister Lapid to actually connect directly with those who are running the field hospital.  We did it virtually, and it was very powerful to see that in action.</p>
<p>This support is crucial as more and more Ukrainian men, women, and children are being killed, maimed, displaced by Moscow’s attacks; more are trapped in barbaric sieges, where they are denied food, water, medicine; and where people are starving.  Fully half the children in Ukraine have been displaced by Russia’s aggression.  Half the children in the country.</p>
<p>I also made clear the conviction that the United States has that Israelis and Palestinians deserve to enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, and dignity.  And that’s one of the principal reasons we support a negotiated two-state solution.</p>
<p>The prime minister and his government have made important efforts to address some of the challenges facing Palestinians, increasing Israeli water sales to Gaza, granting permits now to 20,000 people from Gaza to work in Israel, legalizing the status of thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank.  And we very much hope to see more efforts along these lines in the near term.</p>
<p>We’re also encouraged to see members of the prime minister’s cabinet meeting with Palestinian leaders – including Defense Minister Ganz, whom I’ll see in a short while.</p>
<p>Our administration is also rebuilding America’s relationship with the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people, something I’ll continue to do today in Ramallah with President Abbas, and in East Jerusalem with leaders of that community’s vibrant and diverse civil society.  We’re increasing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people, totaling half a billion dollars since April 2021.</p>
<p>Today, we also discussed ways to foster a peaceful Passover, Ramadan, and Easter across Israel, and Gaza and the West Bank, particularly in Jerusalem, a city of such profound importance to Jews, to Christians, to Muslims.</p>
<p>And that means working to prevent actions on all sides that could raise tensions, including settlement expansion, settler violence, incitement to violence, demolitions, payments to individuals convicted of terrorism, evictions of families from homes they’ve lived in for decades – it’s a message that I’ll be underscoring in all of my meetings on this trip.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are increasing our efforts to foster partnerships between Palestinian and Israeli grassroots organizations, businesses, young people, other parts of society, through a five-year, $250 million Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act.</p>
<p>Right after this, in fact, I will have a chance to meet with one of the program’s first grantees – a project that brings together groups in Gaza, the West Bank, and Israel to tackle the interconnected problem of water scarcity.  Efforts like this will not only improve people’s lives, but build relationships that can help defuse tension and violence, and ultimately, lay a foundation for dialogue and for peace.</p>
<p>Finally, as the prime minister said, we discussed how we can continue to build on the significant progress of the Abraham Accords and normalization – including in the summit starting this evening, the Negev.  The United States will continue not only to support and to work with those who already normalized relations, but also to urge more governments to take this important step – to the benefit of people in their countries and far beyond.</p>
<p>Mr. Prime Minister, your recent trilateral summit with President al-Sisi and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed as well as President Herzog’s visit to Turkey for meetings with President Erdogan and others – these are just the latest demonstrations of broader engagement that is made possible as normalization becomes the new normal throughout the region.  And again, I applaud Israel’s leadership, its engagement, its diplomacy in building these agreements and making them real.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for hosting us today – and again, for such a constructive, important exchange on everything we’ve just talked about and more.  And thank you for continuing to strengthen what is an enduring and powerful friendship between Israel and the United States.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Israel Presidency</strong></p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT HERZOG:  </strong>So <i>shalom</i>, welcome, Secretary of State Antony, Tony, Blinken, a good friend, a long-time friend, and a great friend of the State of Israel.  Your visit means a lot to us, and we welcome you whole-heartedly here in Jerusalem.  And we congratulate you for joining this wonderful summit which will take place today, the Negev Summit, which will include foreign ministers from regional states that are so important to this unified front, which has been built in the region, which is based on the Abraham Accords, and which moves forward in peace and mutual cooperation and respect.</p>
<p>I want to commend Foreign Minister Yair Lapid for convening this summit, and wish him success in this very important gathering.  We will work together to find further regional cooperations, and for the benefit of all peoples in the region, and the benefit of peace, and, of course, preventing any threats against Israel, as well as my own personal commitment to move forward and try to help in all relevant cooperations and activities that are pushing forward together with our friends and allies in this region.</p>
<p>I will conclude by saying, Foreign Minister, that – Foreign Secretary, that we all welcome you here not only because you are a friend, but also because the United States is Israel’s most important ally and closest friend in the world.  And we see you as friends and part of the family.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you so much, Mr. President.  It’s wonderful to be with you, it’s wonderful to be in Israel, it’s wonderful to be here in this very special place.  And it’s also an honor.</p>
<p>To your point, this evening, when we head to the Negev, what is happening there is something that I think would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.  And what we’re seeing is normalization become the new normal for this region.  And I think it’s going to attract more and more countries, as they see the benefits of these partnerships among so many of the leading countries in – from the region.</p>
<p>The United States is very proud to be a part of that, to support the efforts to deepen the partnerships with countries that have already normalized with Israel, and to help seek new partners, and to make sure that, as we’re working together, we’re doing it in a way that, of course, stands up for our common security – because we face common challenges – but also finds ways to make meaningful difference in the lives of our citizens.</p>
<p>And that’s the tremendous opportunity of what is coming together in the Negev later today:  the opportunity to work together, invest together in infrastructure, in global health, in dealing with climate change, renewable energy, bringing our businesses together, bringing our people together.  It’s an incredibly powerful and positive vision for the future, and Israel is making that real, and I applaud that.</p>
<p>And I also have to say, Mr. President, how much we applaud the leadership of this government, including, for example, on trying to bring an end to Russia’s horrific aggression against Ukraine.  Prime Minister Bennett has made important efforts to see if there’s a diplomatic path forward.  We applaud them.  We applaud the support that you’re providing, including the humanitarian hospital, a field hospital in Israel that is set up that is able to see directly, by a video link with –</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT HERZOG:</strong>  Yes, I spoke to them on Friday night, (inaudible) congratulated them all.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  It’s a wonderful thing.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT HERZOG:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  And, of course, there is much to discuss about the relationship to Palestinians, and our support for them, and the work that’s being done to try to improve their lives, as well.</p>
<p>So lots to talk about.  But for me it’s always especially wonderful and meaningful to be in Israel.  The United States has a deep attachment to this country, to this relationship, to this partnership, to this alliance.  We have a sacrosanct commitment to Israel’s security.  President Biden reaffirmed that again recently with the provision of $1 billion for Iron Dome, something that has saved lives in the past and, if necessary, will do so in the future.</p>
<p>And I will just say simply, in concluding, it’s also very meaningful to me on a personal level, as well.  So thank you.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT HERZOG:</strong>  Thank you very much.  I – no, I will just say to all the visitors in the Negev Summit:  Secretary of State Tony Blinken, foreign ministers of the UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, and Egypt.  (In Hebrew.)  We welcome you all to the State of Israel.  (In Hebrew.)  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jerusalem</strong></p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  We’ll start with statements, first by Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, followed by Secretary of State.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER LAPID:</strong>  Thank you.  Good morning.  I’m happy to welcome my good friend, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, to Jerusalem.  Later today the two of us will head south for the historic Negev Summit with the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, and Morocco.</p>
<p>The relationship between our two countries is unbreakable.  The United States is Israel’s closest friendship and strongest alliance.  We share deeply-held values and core interests.  We share a vision of peace through strength.  These days are a reminder of the fact that, if you want peace, you must be able to defend it.</p>
<p>Military and diplomatic strength isn’t an obstacle to peace; it is what guarantees peace.  This is an opportunity to thank the administration and both parties in Congress for their support for the Iron Dome Missile Defense System, and for the approval of security assistance for Israel.  These are vital components of our national security.</p>
<p>My friend, you are making the lives of my children safer.</p>
<p>This morning we have discussed two main topics:  the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a possible nuclear agreement with Iran.  Israel condemns the invasion, and has been providing military assistance to Ukraine since the first day of the war.  As we stand here, Israeli medical teams are risking their lives at the field hospital we established in Ukraine.  Israel continues to transfer trucks with humanitarian aid and to assist refugees in every way.</p>
<p>Regarding the Iranian issue, Iran is not an Israeli problem.  The world cannot afford a nuclear Iran.  The world cannot afford for the Iranians’ Revolutionary Guard Corps to continue spreading terror around the globe.</p>
<p>We have disagreements about a nuclear agreement and its consequences, but open and honest dialogue is part of the strength of our friendship.  Israel and the United States will continue to work together to prevent a nuclear Iran.</p>
<p>At the same time, Israel will do anything we believe is needed to stop the Iranian nuclear program.  Anything.  From our point of view, the Iranian threat is not theoretical; the Iranians want to destroy Israel.  They will not succeed.  We will not let them.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, good morning, everyone.  And Yair, it is always good to be with you, whether that is here in Jerusalem, in Washington, in Riga, the many other places we meet around the world.  And if you’ll indulge me for just a minute, I haven’t had a chance to talk to some of our colleagues since the trip that we took with the President to Europe, so I’m going to say a few words about that before focusing in on some of the things that we talked about in more detail.</p>
<p>But I have just come from with President’s trip to Europe, where we saw the clearest demonstration yet of the unity and determination among our allies and partners when it comes to ending Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and standing with the people of Ukraine.</p>
<p>We had the NATO Summit, where allies agreed to further reinforce NATO’s eastern flank, so that we can defend every inch of NATO territory.</p>
<p>The United States, our allies and partners committed also to continue to provide Ukraine with the military assistance that it needs to defend against the onslaught of planes and tanks, including anti-aircraft systems, anti-armor weapons, drones, and many more.</p>
<p>In meetings with the G7 and the European Union, we committed to increasing sanctions on those who bear the greatest responsibility for the unjustified aggression against Ukraine, and to strengthen their enforcement.</p>
<p>We announced a groundbreaking initiative between the European Union and the United States to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy, while accelerating the region’s transition to renewables.</p>
<p>And in Warsaw, Secretary of Defense Austin and I had the opportunity to meet face to face with our Ukrainian counterparts, colleagues that we talk to almost every day.  It was particularly good to actually see them face to face, to give them a readout of the meetings that we’d had in Europe, and to pledge our ongoing support to meet Ukraine’s security, humanitarian, and economic needs.</p>
<p>I also joined the President in what was an incredibly moving hour-plus in meeting with refugees from Ukraine in Warsaw.  I had the same opportunity to do that on my own a few weeks ago on the border between Ukraine and Poland.  One of most striking things in meeting with these refugees is just how many of them are children, newborns, toddlers.  According to the United Nations, more than half – more than half – of all Ukrainian children have been displaced by this war, which is one of the most powerful reminders of why our efforts to stop the war are so important.</p>
<p>The visit was also a reminder of a trailblazing diplomat, a friend, a mentor to me we lost earlier this week, who was also forced from her home in Czechoslovakia twice as a child – first by the Nazis, years later by the Communists – and whose family eventually found refuge in the United States.  Madeleine Albright never forgot why it mattered for countries to open their arms to the displaced, to stand up to tyrants and persecutors who drive them from their homes.</p>
<p>It’s an experience that I know left an indelible impression on your father, my stepfather, something that both of our families feel very strongly.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER LAPID:</strong>  So true.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Ending Russia’s war of choice was one of the issues that we discussed just a short while ago.  We very much appreciate the foreign minister’s unequivocal condemnation of the Kremlin’s aggression and the commitment that Israel will not be used in any way to bypass sanctions targeting Russia.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Israel was one of 140 countries at the UN that voted to demand protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure and humanitarian access while, again, condemning Russia’s aggression and its responsibility for creating this dire situation.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Bennett has dedicated substantial energy to trying to find a diplomatic way out of the conflict, something we very much support, while the government has provided vital humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>I got a chance to see the field hospital.  We videoed in to colleagues who were there providing remarkable support through this field hospital – Kohar Meir, a shining star named after Golda Meir, herself a refugee from Ukraine.  And this hospital is staffed entirely by Israeli volunteer doctors and nurses, most of whom are Ukrainian or Russian speakers.</p>
<p>So the people of Israel are standing with Ukraine in so many ways, and not just this field hospital.  Thousands came out to Tel Aviv’s Habima Square to protest against the Kremlin’s war.  When United Hatzalah asked for volunteers to go to Moldova to aid the many refugees who are arriving there, more than a thousand volunteers raised their hands to do just that.</p>
<p>And it’s not just the people of Ukraine and Russia who are feeling the impact of the Kremlin’s aggressive actions.  Russia’s war is also causing food prices to rise, especially wheat, just as economies are recovering from COVID-19.  This impact is acutely felt in this region, where most countries import at least half of their wheat, a significant proportion of which comes from Ukraine.  The cost of basic staples like bread is rising, hitting the most vulnerable people the hardest.</p>
<p>Over the course of this trip we’ll be discussing steps that we can take in coordination with partners to mitigate these consequences to alleviate some of the burden that this is placing on people, including throughout the Middle East.</p>
<p>I made the trip here, during which I’ll visit Israel, the West Bank, Morocco, Algeria because this is a part of the world where the United States has vital interests and some of our closest friends. The United States will continue to invest in the region, strengthening the relationships that are central to stability in the Middle East and North Africa, making progress on enduring challenges, broadening opportunities for our people, and at the same time staying focused on ending the Kremlin’s war of aggression.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem I’ll also have the chance to meet with Prime Minister Bennett, President Herzog, Defense Minister Ganz.  Across these meetings I will affirm, as I always do, as President Biden always does, America’s ironclad commitment to Israel’s security.  We discussed this a short while ago.</p>
<p>And indeed, just a few days ago, President Biden signed the omnibus funding bill that includes $1 billion for the Iron Dome system, which has saved countless lives, including during last year’s conflict with Hamas.</p>
<p>We forcefully condemn the recent terrorist attack in Beersheba, and extend our deepest condolences to the loved ones of the victims.</p>
<p>And Iran is, of course, as Yair said, was a key topic of discussion. When it comes to the most important element, we see eye to eye.  We are both committed, both determined that Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is another reminder of why this is so important:  an Iran with a nuclear weapon or the capacity to produce one on short notice would become even more aggressive, and would believe it could act with a false sense of impunity.</p>
<p>The United States believes that a return to full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the best way to put Iran’s nuclear program back in the box that it was in, but has escaped from since the United States withdrew from that agreement.  But whether there’s a JCPOA or not, our commitment to the core principle of Iran never acquiring a nuclear weapon is unwavering.  And one way or another, we will continue to coordinate closely with our Israeli partners on the way forward.</p>
<p>This cooperation is essential because, beyond its nuclear efforts, Iran continues to engage in a whole series of destabilizing activities across the region and beyond – indeed, those activities have also multiplied since our withdrawal from the JCPOA – via proxies and by Iran itself.</p>
<p>These include mounting terrorist attacks by the Houthis on civilians and civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – attacks enabled by Iran – and, of course, its ongoing support for Hamas.  The United States will continue to stand up to Iran when it threatens us or when it threatens our allies and partners, and we’ll continue to work with Israel to counter its aggression – its aggressive behavior throughout the region.</p>
<p>A more stable, integrated region gives us a stronger foundation for addressing shared threats like these, and for seizing shared opportunities. That is why we are fully committed to expanding cooperation through the Abraham Accords, and building on the remarkable progress that Israel, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco have made in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>The Negev Summit that Yair has convened and that we will take part in, along with Egypt, would have been unthinkable just a few years ago, and it is only the latest first in a year-and-a-half of them.</p>
<p>So Yair, I want to commend you for your remarkable leadership in this effort, for spearheading new areas of cooperation made possible through the accords.  We have something, for example, called I2-U2, which we launched last October, together with our Emirati and Indian counterparts.  And more on that in the days ahead.</p>
<p>But simply put, normalization is becoming the new normal in this region.  And it is enabling our efforts to advance a positive agenda that will actually benefit the lives of our people:  investing in infrastructure, developing renewable energy, collaborating on global health, forging ties between students, artists, businesses.  All of these things will have concrete benefits for people across the region.</p>
<p>And across these efforts we will look to build on growing normalization, to bring others in, while also forging tangible improvements in the lives of Palestinians and preserving our longstanding goal of reaching a negotiated two-state solution.</p>
<p>Later today I’ll travel to Ramallah to meet with President Abbas and to underscore this administration’s commitment to strengthening our relationship with the Palestinian Authority and with the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>I’ll also meet with Palestinians in East Jerusalem, who are a critical part of the city’s vibrant and diverse civil society and underscore our work with Palestinian nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p>As part of the administration’s efforts, we’re increasing humanitarian assistance to Palestinians; supporting the growing Palestinian private sector; investing significantly in new partnerships between Israelis and Palestinians at the grassroots level to address shared challenges.</p>
<p>In my meetings with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders, we’ll discuss ways to calm tensions and ensure a peaceful Ramadan, Easter, and Passover.  That’s the message that Yair and King Abdullah of Jordan sent jointly after their recent meeting, and it’s one all leaders should reinforce.</p>
<p>So, my friend, thank you for your leadership, for your partnership, for your friendship.  It is, as always, great to be here, and great to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER LAPID:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Thank you, Minister.  Thank you, Secretary.  We will now take one question of each side.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Mr. Secretary.  Good to have you in Israel.  Barak Ravid from Walla News and Axios.</p>
<p>First question to Mr. Lapid:  What practical steps did you tell the Secretary Blinken that the Israel is going to take to implement international sanctions on Russia?  Until now, other than rhetorical commitment to the sanctions, Israel did not take any steps.  Did you commit to the Secretary to take steps on that front?</p>
<p>And the second question – it’s a yes/no question to both of you – is the IRGC a foreign terrorist organization?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER LAPID:</strong>  Okay.  I think I’m quoting the Secretary.  He said the United States greatly appreciates our work with the sanctions.  It was presented to the American delegation what are we doing, how are we doing it, how do we confront the fact that Israel has no comprehensive sanction bill and yet we succeed in being part of the world – the global effort to stop this war through the sanctions.</p>
<p>So I think there is no doubt in anyone’s mind, while our team was presenting this to the American delegation, that Israel is doing everything it can in order to be part of the effort.</p>
<p>As for the second question, yes, it is a terror organization and should be dealt as such.  And also, it is – has the proxy terrorist organization like Hizballah, like the Houthis in Yemen, and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Barak, first of all, it’s very good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Is it?  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, that’s interesting you say that.  (Laughter.)  Indeed, I often discover what I’m thinking or doing before I even know that I’m thinking it or doing it by reading you.</p>
<p>Two things.  First, we – in the course of our conversation, I was briefed by the senior official here in Israel in charge of sanctions implementation, export control implementation.  And we very much appreciate the work that Israel is doing on that score.  We’ll remain in close contact and close consultation on sanctions, on export controls.  This is a vitally important part of our effort to put meaningful pressure on Russia to end the aggression in Ukraine.</p>
<p>With regard to the IRGC, it is probably the most designated organization, in one way or another, in the world among organizations that we designate, including the foreign terrorist organization designation.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Our question will go to John Hudson of The Washington Post.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  Mr. Secretary, U.S. allies around the world have stepped up in big ways in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, from Europe to Asia to Africa.  But the Middle East has lagged.  Saudi Arabia isn’t ramping up oil production; the UAE has issued some tepid statements at the UN; and Ukraine’s president called out Israel for failing to impose sanctions or send military assistance.  Are you satisfied with the region’s response?</p>
<p>Secondly, could you explain President Biden’s comment that Putin cannot remain in power, and do you think those remarks risk Moscow severing diplomatic ties with the U.S.?</p>
<p>Minister Lapid, the United States is Israel’s biggest financial, political, and security partner by a long shot.  It says it wants to open a consulate that services the Palestinians.  How can you justify standing in the way of Washington’s desire to conduct the diplomacy the way that it wants to?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks, John.  So a couple of things.  First, with regard to the work in this region, both in support of Ukraine and in standing against Russia’s aggression, including through the imposition of sanctions and export controls, this is very much a part of the conversation we’ve had today, and I’ll be having throughout the course of my visit here, including with our partners.</p>
<p>Just speaking to Israel, again, we greatly appreciate, first of all, its strong repudiation of Russian aggression against Ukraine.  We very much appreciate, as well, the foreign minister’s commitment to ensure that Israel is not used as any kind of back door for sanctions evasion.  And as I mentioned a moment ago, I had a very good briefing from the senior official in charge of sanctions and export control implementation.  We will be working very closely on that.</p>
<p>And we saw, quite literally, via video, the extraordinary work that Israel is doing on a humanitarian basis to help those suffering from the aggression in Ukraine with a field hospital.  And we will be talking throughout about various means of support that Israel and other countries can give to Ukraine, whether it comes to security assistance, whether it comes to humanitarian assistance, economic assistance, or, again, making sure that sanctions are implemented.  That will be a conversation that’s ongoing throughout this trip.</p>
<p>With regard to the President’s incredibly powerful speech yesterday, I think the President, the White House made the point last night that, quite simply, President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else.  As you know, and as you’ve heard us say repeatedly, we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia or anywhere else, for that matter.  In this case, as in any case, it’s up to the people of the country in question.  It’s up to the Russian people.</p>
<p>But what we do have is a strategy to strongly support Ukraine.  We’ve been doing that, and rallying partners and allies around the world to do that, including with unprecedented amounts of security assistance.  It’s having a meaningful impact on Ukraine’s ability to defend itself from this onslaught of planes and tanks and other weapons.  We have a strategy to put unprecedented pressure on Russia, and we’re carrying that forward.  And we have a strategy to make sure that we’re providing all of the humanitarian support that we can, and we have a strategy to reinforce NATO.  All of that is going forward.  The President laid that out in great detail yesterday, and that’s what we’re focused on.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER LAPID:</strong>  Well, John, first of all, yes.  The United States is our greatest ally and greatest friend.  And therefore, we take very seriously whatever subject they want to put on the table.  Part of this friendship is the fact that we have the ability to have an open dialogue about everything.</p>
<p>We have no problem, of course, if – and it’s not even our place to say anything – if the United States want to open an office to deal with the problems of – day-to-day problems, or consular problems of Palestinians.  We just don’t think Jerusalem is the right place for this, because Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and Israel alone.</p>
<p>Thank you, everybody.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jerusalem</strong></p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  We’ll start with statements, first by Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, followed by Secretary of State.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER LAPID:</strong>  Thank you.  Good morning.  I’m happy to welcome my good friend, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, to Jerusalem.  Later today the two of us will head south for the historic Negev Summit with the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, and Morocco.</p>
<p>The relationship between our two countries is unbreakable.  The United States is Israel’s closest friendship and strongest alliance.  We share deeply-held values and core interests.  We share a vision of peace through strength.  These days are a reminder of the fact that, if you want peace, you must be able to defend it.</p>
<p>Military and diplomatic strength isn’t an obstacle to peace; it is what guarantees peace.  This is an opportunity to thank the administration and both parties in Congress for their support for the Iron Dome Missile Defense System, and for the approval of security assistance for Israel.  These are vital components of our national security.</p>
<p>My friend, you are making the lives of my children safer.</p>
<p>This morning we have discussed two main topics:  the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a possible nuclear agreement with Iran.  Israel condemns the invasion, and has been providing military assistance to Ukraine since the first day of the war.  As we stand here, Israeli medical teams are risking their lives at the field hospital we established in Ukraine.  Israel continues to transfer trucks with humanitarian aid and to assist refugees in every way.</p>
<p>Regarding the Iranian issue, Iran is not an Israeli problem.  The world cannot afford a nuclear Iran.  The world cannot afford for the Iranians’ Revolutionary Guard Corps to continue spreading terror around the globe.</p>
<p>We have disagreements about a nuclear agreement and its consequences, but open and honest dialogue is part of the strength of our friendship.  Israel and the United States will continue to work together to prevent a nuclear Iran.</p>
<p>At the same time, Israel will do anything we believe is needed to stop the Iranian nuclear program.  Anything.  From our point of view, the Iranian threat is not theoretical; the Iranians want to destroy Israel.  They will not succeed.  We will not let them.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, good morning, everyone.  And Yair, it is always good to be with you, whether that is here in Jerusalem, in Washington, in Riga, the many other places we meet around the world.  And if you’ll indulge me for just a minute, I haven’t had a chance to talk to some of our colleagues since the trip that we took with the President to Europe, so I’m going to say a few words about that before focusing in on some of the things that we talked about in more detail.</p>
<p>But I have just come from with President’s trip to Europe, where we saw the clearest demonstration yet of the unity and determination among our allies and partners when it comes to ending Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and standing with the people of Ukraine.</p>
<p>We had the NATO Summit, where allies agreed to further reinforce NATO’s eastern flank, so that we can defend every inch of NATO territory.</p>
<p>The United States, our allies and partners committed also to continue to provide Ukraine with the military assistance that it needs to defend against the onslaught of planes and tanks, including anti-aircraft systems, anti-armor weapons, drones, and many more.</p>
<p>In meetings with the G7 and the European Union, we committed to increasing sanctions on those who bear the greatest responsibility for the unjustified aggression against Ukraine, and to strengthen their enforcement.</p>
<p>We announced a groundbreaking initiative between the European Union and the United States to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy, while accelerating the region’s transition to renewables.</p>
<p>And in Warsaw, Secretary of Defense Austin and I had the opportunity to meet face to face with our Ukrainian counterparts, colleagues that we talk to almost every day.  It was particularly good to actually see them face to face, to give them a readout of the meetings that we’d had in Europe, and to pledge our ongoing support to meet Ukraine’s security, humanitarian, and economic needs.</p>
<p>I also joined the President in what was an incredibly moving hour-plus in meeting with refugees from Ukraine in Warsaw.  I had the same opportunity to do that on my own a few weeks ago on the border between Ukraine and Poland.  One of most striking things in meeting with these refugees is just how many of them are children, newborns, toddlers.  According to the United Nations, more than half – more than half – of all Ukrainian children have been displaced by this war, which is one of the most powerful reminders of why our efforts to stop the war are so important.</p>
<p>The visit was also a reminder of a trailblazing diplomat, a friend, a mentor to me we lost earlier this week, who was also forced from her home in Czechoslovakia twice as a child – first by the Nazis, years later by the Communists – and whose family eventually found refuge in the United States.  Madeleine Albright never forgot why it mattered for countries to open their arms to the displaced, to stand up to tyrants and persecutors who drive them from their homes.</p>
<p>It’s an experience that I know left an indelible impression on your father, my stepfather, something that both of our families feel very strongly.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER LAPID:</strong>  So true.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Ending Russia’s war of choice was one of the issues that we discussed just a short while ago.  We very much appreciate the foreign minister’s unequivocal condemnation of the Kremlin’s aggression and the commitment that Israel will not be used in any way to bypass sanctions targeting Russia.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Israel was one of 140 countries at the UN that voted to demand protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure and humanitarian access while, again, condemning Russia’s aggression and its responsibility for creating this dire situation.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Bennett has dedicated substantial energy to trying to find a diplomatic way out of the conflict, something we very much support, while the government has provided vital humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>I got a chance to see the field hospital.  We videoed in to colleagues who were there providing remarkable support through this field hospital – Kohar Meir, a shining star named after Golda Meir, herself a refugee from Ukraine.  And this hospital is staffed entirely by Israeli volunteer doctors and nurses, most of whom are Ukrainian or Russian speakers.</p>
<p>So the people of Israel are standing with Ukraine in so many ways, and not just this field hospital.  Thousands came out to Tel Aviv’s Habima Square to protest against the Kremlin’s war.  When United Hatzalah asked for volunteers to go to Moldova to aid the many refugees who are arriving there, more than a thousand volunteers raised their hands to do just that.</p>
<p>And it’s not just the people of Ukraine and Russia who are feeling the impact of the Kremlin’s aggressive actions.  Russia’s war is also causing food prices to rise, especially wheat, just as economies are recovering from COVID-19.  This impact is acutely felt in this region, where most countries import at least half of their wheat, a significant proportion of which comes from Ukraine.  The cost of basic staples like bread is rising, hitting the most vulnerable people the hardest.</p>
<p>Over the course of this trip we’ll be discussing steps that we can take in coordination with partners to mitigate these consequences to alleviate some of the burden that this is placing on people, including throughout the Middle East.</p>
<p>I made the trip here, during which I’ll visit Israel, the West Bank, Morocco, Algeria because this is a part of the world where the United States has vital interests and some of our closest friends. The United States will continue to invest in the region, strengthening the relationships that are central to stability in the Middle East and North Africa, making progress on enduring challenges, broadening opportunities for our people, and at the same time staying focused on ending the Kremlin’s war of aggression.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem I’ll also have the chance to meet with Prime Minister Bennett, President Herzog, Defense Minister Ganz.  Across these meetings I will affirm, as I always do, as President Biden always does, America’s ironclad commitment to Israel’s security.  We discussed this a short while ago.</p>
<p>And indeed, just a few days ago, President Biden signed the omnibus funding bill that includes $1 billion for the Iron Dome system, which has saved countless lives, including during last year’s conflict with Hamas.</p>
<p>We forcefully condemn the recent terrorist attack in Beersheba, and extend our deepest condolences to the loved ones of the victims.</p>
<p>And Iran is, of course, as Yair said, was a key topic of discussion. When it comes to the most important element, we see eye to eye.  We are both committed, both determined that Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is another reminder of why this is so important:  an Iran with a nuclear weapon or the capacity to produce one on short notice would become even more aggressive, and would believe it could act with a false sense of impunity.</p>
<p>The United States believes that a return to full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the best way to put Iran’s nuclear program back in the box that it was in, but has escaped from since the United States withdrew from that agreement.  But whether there’s a JCPOA or not, our commitment to the core principle of Iran never acquiring a nuclear weapon is unwavering.  And one way or another, we will continue to coordinate closely with our Israeli partners on the way forward.</p>
<p>This cooperation is essential because, beyond its nuclear efforts, Iran continues to engage in a whole series of destabilizing activities across the region and beyond – indeed, those activities have also multiplied since our withdrawal from the JCPOA – via proxies and by Iran itself.</p>
<p>These include mounting terrorist attacks by the Houthis on civilians and civilian infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – attacks enabled by Iran – and, of course, its ongoing support for Hamas.  The United States will continue to stand up to Iran when it threatens us or when it threatens our allies and partners, and we’ll continue to work with Israel to counter its aggression – its aggressive behavior throughout the region.</p>
<p>A more stable, integrated region gives us a stronger foundation for addressing shared threats like these, and for seizing shared opportunities. That is why we are fully committed to expanding cooperation through the Abraham Accords, and building on the remarkable progress that Israel, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco have made in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>The Negev Summit that Yair has convened and that we will take part in, along with Egypt, would have been unthinkable just a few years ago, and it is only the latest first in a year-and-a-half of them.</p>
<p>So Yair, I want to commend you for your remarkable leadership in this effort, for spearheading new areas of cooperation made possible through the accords.  We have something, for example, called I2-U2, which we launched last October, together with our Emirati and Indian counterparts.  And more on that in the days ahead.</p>
<p>But simply put, normalization is becoming the new normal in this region.  And it is enabling our efforts to advance a positive agenda that will actually benefit the lives of our people:  investing in infrastructure, developing renewable energy, collaborating on global health, forging ties between students, artists, businesses.  All of these things will have concrete benefits for people across the region.</p>
<p>And across these efforts we will look to build on growing normalization, to bring others in, while also forging tangible improvements in the lives of Palestinians and preserving our longstanding goal of reaching a negotiated two-state solution.</p>
<p>Later today I’ll travel to Ramallah to meet with President Abbas and to underscore this administration’s commitment to strengthening our relationship with the Palestinian Authority and with the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>I’ll also meet with Palestinians in East Jerusalem, who are a critical part of the city’s vibrant and diverse civil society and underscore our work with Palestinian nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p>As part of the administration’s efforts, we’re increasing humanitarian assistance to Palestinians; supporting the growing Palestinian private sector; investing significantly in new partnerships between Israelis and Palestinians at the grassroots level to address shared challenges.</p>
<p>In my meetings with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders, we’ll discuss ways to calm tensions and ensure a peaceful Ramadan, Easter, and Passover.  That’s the message that Yair and King Abdullah of Jordan sent jointly after their recent meeting, and it’s one all leaders should reinforce.</p>
<p>So, my friend, thank you for your leadership, for your partnership, for your friendship.  It is, as always, great to be here, and great to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER LAPID:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Thank you, Minister.  Thank you, Secretary.  We will now take one question of each side.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Mr. Secretary.  Good to have you in Israel.  Barak Ravid from Walla News and Axios.</p>
<p>First question to Mr. Lapid:  What practical steps did you tell the Secretary Blinken that the Israel is going to take to implement international sanctions on Russia?  Until now, other than rhetorical commitment to the sanctions, Israel did not take any steps.  Did you commit to the Secretary to take steps on that front?</p>
<p>And the second question – it’s a yes/no question to both of you – is the IRGC a foreign terrorist organization?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER LAPID:</strong>  Okay.  I think I’m quoting the Secretary.  He said the United States greatly appreciates our work with the sanctions.  It was presented to the American delegation what are we doing, how are we doing it, how do we confront the fact that Israel has no comprehensive sanction bill and yet we succeed in being part of the world – the global effort to stop this war through the sanctions.</p>
<p>So I think there is no doubt in anyone’s mind, while our team was presenting this to the American delegation, that Israel is doing everything it can in order to be part of the effort.</p>
<p>As for the second question, yes, it is a terror organization and should be dealt as such.  And also, it is – has the proxy terrorist organization like Hizballah, like the Houthis in Yemen, and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Barak, first of all, it’s very good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Is it?  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, that’s interesting you say that.  (Laughter.)  Indeed, I often discover what I’m thinking or doing before I even know that I’m thinking it or doing it by reading you.</p>
<p>Two things.  First, we – in the course of our conversation, I was briefed by the senior official here in Israel in charge of sanctions implementation, export control implementation.  And we very much appreciate the work that Israel is doing on that score.  We’ll remain in close contact and close consultation on sanctions, on export controls.  This is a vitally important part of our effort to put meaningful pressure on Russia to end the aggression in Ukraine.</p>
<p>With regard to the IRGC, it is probably the most designated organization, in one way or another, in the world among organizations that we designate, including the foreign terrorist organization designation.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Our question will go to John Hudson of The Washington Post.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  Mr. Secretary, U.S. allies around the world have stepped up in big ways in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, from Europe to Asia to Africa.  But the Middle East has lagged.  Saudi Arabia isn’t ramping up oil production; the UAE has issued some tepid statements at the UN; and Ukraine’s president called out Israel for failing to impose sanctions or send military assistance.  Are you satisfied with the region’s response?</p>
<p>Secondly, could you explain President Biden’s comment that Putin cannot remain in power, and do you think those remarks risk Moscow severing diplomatic ties with the U.S.?</p>
<p>Minister Lapid, the United States is Israel’s biggest financial, political, and security partner by a long shot.  It says it wants to open a consulate that services the Palestinians.  How can you justify standing in the way of Washington’s desire to conduct the diplomacy the way that it wants to?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks, John.  So a couple of things.  First, with regard to the work in this region, both in support of Ukraine and in standing against Russia’s aggression, including through the imposition of sanctions and export controls, this is very much a part of the conversation we’ve had today, and I’ll be having throughout the course of my visit here, including with our partners.</p>

<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER LAPID:</strong>  Well, John, first of all, yes.  The United States is our greatest ally and greatest friend.  And therefore, we take very seriously whatever subject they want to put on the table.  Part of this friendship is the fact that we have the ability to have an open dialogue about everything.</p>
<p>We have no problem, of course, if – and it’s not even our place to say anything – if the United States want to open an office to deal with the problems of – day-to-day problems, or consular problems of Palestinians.  We just don’t think Jerusalem is the right place for this, because Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and Israel alone.</p>
<p>Thank you, everybody.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you all.</p>
