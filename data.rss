<p>The Department of State is taking additional steps to impose severe costs on the Government of the Russian Federation and promote accountability for its war of aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Imposing Visa Restrictions</h2>
<p>The Department of State is announcing a series of actions to promote accountability for actions by Russian Federation officials and others that violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, including those implicated in abuses perpetrated in Zaporizhzhia and Mariupol, as well as actions to suppress dissent in Russia, to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Action to impose visa restrictions on 511 officers of the Russian Federation military, including officers operating in the Zaporizhzhia and Mariupol areas, pursuant to a policy under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that applies to those who are believed to have supported, been actively complicit in, or been responsible for ordering or otherwise directing or authorizing actions that threaten or violate the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of Ukraine.</li>
<li>Action to impose visa restrictions on 18 Russian Federation nationals pursuant to a policy under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that applies to current and former Russian Federation officials believed to be involved in suppressing dissent in Russia and abroad and their family members.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Targeting Russia-Installed Political Leaders</h2>
<p>The Department of State is designating Halyna Danylchenko, the illegitimate Russia-installed “mayor” of Melitopol, pursuant to Section 1(a)(ii)(F) of Executive Order (E.O.) 14024, for being responsible for or complicit in, or having directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in activities that undermine the peace, security, political stability, or territorial integrity of the United States, its allies, or its partners for or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation.  Danylchenko was installed by Russia following the kidnapping of the democratically elected mayor of Melitopol.</p>
<h2>Targeting Russia&#8217;s Defense Establishment</h2>
<p>Today, as part of its latest action to impose severe costs on the Russian Federation’s defense establishment in response to Putin’s war of aggression, the Department of State is designating 45 defense-related entities pursuant to E.O. 14024.  Russia’s defense establishment is responsible for Russia’s appalling campaign of violence against the people of Ukraine, which has caused widespread and needless suffering and many hundreds and likely thousands of civilian casualties, including the deaths of children.  These actions include the designation of an entity outside of Russia for providing material support to a blocked Russian entity, in this case, one that specializes in procuring items for Russia’s defense industry; Russian Federation military units and a Russian Federation intelligence agency that have been credibly implicated in human rights abuses or violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine; defense-related entities that produce components for Russian Federation weapons systems; and Russian Federation entities that lead Russia’s efforts to export arms in order to generate revenue to fund Russia’s weapon development efforts.</p>
<p>Further, in coordination with the Department of the Treasury’s designation of State Corporation Rostec today, the Department of State is designating 19 members of the Rostec board of directors and nine of their spouses or adult children.  Rostec is considered to be the cornerstone of Russia’s defense, industrial, technology, and manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p>The board members are being designated pursuant to Sections 1(a)(iii)(A) of E.O. 14024, for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of the Government of the Russian Federation:</p>

<h3>Underscoring the Risks of Doing Business with Sanctioned Russian Federation Entities or Individuals</h3>
<p>On March 3, 2022, the Department of State designated Radioavtomatika pursuant to E.O. 14024 and underscored that Radioavtomatika specializes in procuring foreign items for Russia’s defense industry.  Today, the Department of State has designated the Uzbekistan-based <strong>Promcomplektlogistic Private Company</strong>, which has actively supported Radioavtomatika in Radioavtomatika’s effort to evade U.S. sanctions since Radioavtomatika’s March 3, 2022, designation. Promcomplektlogistic Private Company’s conduct has included providing electronic components such as microcircuits to Radioavtomatika.  Promcomplektlogistic Private Company has been designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 Section 1(a)(vi)(B) because Promcomplektlogistic Private Company has materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of Radioavtomatika, which is an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.  The designation of Promcomplektlogistic Private Company should serve as a warning to commercial stakeholders worldwide: If you do business with sanctioned entities or individuals, you risk exposure to sanctions.  Additionally, Promcomplektlogistic Private Company is being concurrently added to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List.</p>
<h3>Promoting Accountability for Russia’s Abuses</h3>
<p>The Department of State is designating three Russian Federation military units, the <strong>76th Guards Air Assault Division</strong> and its subordinate <strong>234th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment,</strong> as well as the <strong>64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade</strong>, pursuant to E.O. 14024 Section 1(a)(i) because these entities operate or have operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy.</p>
<p>Multiple, credible reports have documented summary executions and other unlawful killings of civilians, beatings of detained persons, and destruction of civilian property by Russia’s forces in Bucha, Ukraine this year.  The United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights has indicated that UN staff documented the unlawful killing of dozens of civilians in Bucha.</p>
<p>In March 2022, Russia’s 76th Guards Air Assault Division and its 234th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment encamped on Bucha, Ukraine’s Yablunska Street, which became an epicenter of violence against civilians and other human rights abuses in Bucha.</p>
<p>Images of dead civilians lining Yablunska street are seared into our global memory and will not be forgotten.</p>
<p>According to credible reports, the 76th Guards Air Assault Division has been directly implicated in violence against unarmed civilians in Bucha, as well as beating detained persons.  A soldier of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division has stated his unit was tasked with “clean up” activities and this involved breaking into residential buildings where civilians lived.</p>
<p>Credible reports also indicate that next to a wall of the 234th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment’s base on Yablunska Street in Bucha, Russia’s forces executed numerous detained Ukrainian citizens.  According to credible reports, the 234th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment has also been directly implicated in the destruction of civilian property such as homes in Bucha.</p>
<p>The 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade also operated in the vicinity of Yablunska Street and other locations in Bucha.  The 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade has been described as the “butchers of Bucha.”  According to credible reports, while operating in Bucha, this unit killed numerous civilians, detained civilians, beat detained civilians, conducted mock executions of civilians, dismembered civilians including removing parts of their scalps and removing their limbs, burned civilians, and seized and damaged civilian homes and property.</p>
<p>After accounts of the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade’s brutality emerged and this unit was accused of war crimes by the Government of Ukraine, the Kremlin responded by issuing a statement – in English – indicating that Russian Federation President Putin had conferred honors upon the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, and Russia’s Ministry of Defense promoted the commanding officer of the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade and praised this officer’s leadership.</p>
<p>The Department of State has also designated the Russian Federation’s <strong>Federal Security Service (FSB)</strong>, which is a Russian government agency that is a Russian internal security and intelligence service, pursuant to E.O. 14024 Section 1(a)(iv) because the FSB is a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the Government of the Russian Federation.  The FSB is also sanctioned under E.O. 13694, as amended, E.O.13382, and Section 224 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.</p>
<p>Since the start of Russia’s further, full-scale invasion of Ukraine, credible reports have indicated that the Federal Security Service (FSB) has perpetrated human rights abuses against Ukrainian citizens.</p>
<p>According to credible reports, prior to initiating its further invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russia planned a process of “filtration,” wherein Ukrainian citizens would be forcibly relocated to Russia-controlled territory or to Russia itself.</p>
<p>Credible reports indicate that the FSB is centrally involved in the Russian Federation’s filtration process, including its filtration camps.  These reports indicate that the FSB runs at least some of the filtration camps and that the FSB has conducted hours-long, harsh interrogations of civilians including interrogations that have involved beating civilians.</p>
<p>Credible accounts indicate that the “filtering” process often involves beating detained Ukrainian citizens, separating the families of Ukrainian citizens, seizing Ukrainian citizens’ passports and other identification documents, depriving detained Ukrainian citizens of food and water for periods of time, and forcibly relocating Ukrainian citizens to remote parts of Russia.  Credible reports also indicate that the filtration camps often have very poor sanitation and that Ukrainian citizens have died in such camps because of a lack of medical care.  There are reports that Ukrainian citizens have been killed in Russia’s filtration camps.  International efforts to verify and document the actual number of Ukrainian civilians affected by forced relocations and filtration camps remain ongoing.</p>
<h3>Imposing Costs on Russia’s Defense Sector</h3>
<p>The Department of State has also designated numerous defense-related Russian Federation entities.  Specifically, the following entities have been designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 Section 1(a)(i) because these entities operate or have operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy:</p>

<p>Further, in coordination with the Department of the Treasury’s designation of State Corporation Rostec today, the Department of State is designating 19 members of the Rostec board of directors and nine of their spouses or adult children.  Rostec is considered to be the cornerstone of Russia’s defense, industrial, technology, and manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p>The board members are being designated pursuant to Sections 1(a)(iii)(A) of E.O. 14024, for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of the Government of the Russian Federation:</p>

<h3>Underscoring the Risks of Doing Business with Sanctioned Russian Federation Entities or Individuals</h3>
<p>On March 3, 2022, the Department of State designated Radioavtomatika pursuant to E.O. 14024 and underscored that Radioavtomatika specializes in procuring foreign items for Russia’s defense industry.  Today, the Department of State has designated the Uzbekistan-based <strong>Promcomplektlogistic Private Company</strong>, which has actively supported Radioavtomatika in Radioavtomatika’s effort to evade U.S. sanctions since Radioavtomatika’s March 3, 2022, designation. Promcomplektlogistic Private Company’s conduct has included providing electronic components such as microcircuits to Radioavtomatika.  Promcomplektlogistic Private Company has been designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 Section 1(a)(vi)(B) because Promcomplektlogistic Private Company has materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of Radioavtomatika, which is an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.  The designation of Promcomplektlogistic Private Company should serve as a warning to commercial stakeholders worldwide: If you do business with sanctioned entities or individuals, you risk exposure to sanctions.  Additionally, Promcomplektlogistic Private Company is being concurrently added to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List.</p>
<h3>Promoting Accountability for Russia’s Abuses</h3>
<p>The Department of State is designating three Russian Federation military units, the <strong>76th Guards Air Assault Division</strong> and its subordinate <strong>234th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment,</strong> as well as the <strong>64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade</strong>, pursuant to E.O. 14024 Section 1(a)(i) because these entities operate or have operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy.</p>
<p>Multiple, credible reports have documented summary executions and other unlawful killings of civilians, beatings of detained persons, and destruction of civilian property by Russia’s forces in Bucha, Ukraine this year.  The United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights has indicated that UN staff documented the unlawful killing of dozens of civilians in Bucha.</p>
<p>In March 2022, Russia’s 76th Guards Air Assault Division and its 234th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment encamped on Bucha, Ukraine’s Yablunska Street, which became an epicenter of violence against civilians and other human rights abuses in Bucha.</p>
<p>Images of dead civilians lining Yablunska street are seared into our global memory and will not be forgotten.</p>
<p>According to credible reports, the 76th Guards Air Assault Division has been directly implicated in violence against unarmed civilians in Bucha, as well as beating detained persons.  A soldier of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division has stated his unit was tasked with “clean up” activities and this involved breaking into residential buildings where civilians lived.</p>
<p>Credible reports also indicate that next to a wall of the 234th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment’s base on Yablunska Street in Bucha, Russia’s forces executed numerous detained Ukrainian citizens.  According to credible reports, the 234th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment has also been directly implicated in the destruction of civilian property such as homes in Bucha.</p>
<p>The 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade also operated in the vicinity of Yablunska Street and other locations in Bucha.  The 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade has been described as the “butchers of Bucha.”  According to credible reports, while operating in Bucha, this unit killed numerous civilians, detained civilians, beat detained civilians, conducted mock executions of civilians, dismembered civilians including removing parts of their scalps and removing their limbs, burned civilians, and seized and damaged civilian homes and property.</p>
<p>After accounts of the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade’s brutality emerged and this unit was accused of war crimes by the Government of Ukraine, the Kremlin responded by issuing a statement – in English – indicating that Russian Federation President Putin had conferred honors upon the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, and Russia’s Ministry of Defense promoted the commanding officer of the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade and praised this officer’s leadership.</p>
<p>The Department of State has also designated the Russian Federation’s <strong>Federal Security Service (FSB)</strong>, which is a Russian government agency that is a Russian internal security and intelligence service, pursuant to E.O. 14024 Section 1(a)(iv) because the FSB is a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the Government of the Russian Federation.  The FSB is also sanctioned under E.O. 13694, as amended, E.O.13382, and Section 224 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.</p>
<p>Since the start of Russia’s further, full-scale invasion of Ukraine, credible reports have indicated that the Federal Security Service (FSB) has perpetrated human rights abuses against Ukrainian citizens.</p>
<p>According to credible reports, prior to initiating its further invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russia planned a process of “filtration,” wherein Ukrainian citizens would be forcibly relocated to Russia-controlled territory or to Russia itself.</p>
<p>Credible reports indicate that the FSB is centrally involved in the Russian Federation’s filtration process, including its filtration camps.  These reports indicate that the FSB runs at least some of the filtration camps and that the FSB has conducted hours-long, harsh interrogations of civilians including interrogations that have involved beating civilians.</p>
<p>Credible accounts indicate that the “filtering” process often involves beating detained Ukrainian citizens, separating the families of Ukrainian citizens, seizing Ukrainian citizens’ passports and other identification documents, depriving detained Ukrainian citizens of food and water for periods of time, and forcibly relocating Ukrainian citizens to remote parts of Russia.  Credible reports also indicate that the filtration camps often have very poor sanitation and that Ukrainian citizens have died in such camps because of a lack of medical care.  There are reports that Ukrainian citizens have been killed in Russia’s filtration camps.  International efforts to verify and document the actual number of Ukrainian civilians affected by forced relocations and filtration camps remain ongoing.</p>

<p>The Department of State has also designated numerous defense-related Russian Federation entities.  Specifically, the following entities have been designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 Section 1(a)(i) because these entities operate or have operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy:</p>

<p>The devastating June 22 earthquake that struck in eastern Afghanistan intensified the ongoing humanitarian crisis the Afghan people have endured for too long. U.S.-funded partners on the ground responded rapidly with medical care, and President Biden directed an assessment of additional needs in the wake of the natural disaster. In response, the United States will provide nearly $55 million in additional immediate humanitarian assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development to urgently reach those most affected by the natural disaster. This new funding brings total U.S. humanitarian assistance to over $774 million in the last year.</p>
<p>This additional disaster relief assistance will reach people affected by the earthquake with critical relief items: shelter materials; pots for cooking; jerry cans to collect and store water; blankets; solar lamps; clothes, and other household items. Assistance will be provided for water, sanitation, and hygiene supplies to prevent waterborne disease outbreak in the aftermath of this natural disaster. The funding will also support other high need areas throughout the country.</p>
<p>The United States has an enduring commitment to the people of Afghanistan, and we welcome and encourage support from our international partners in this time of great need.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of State is pleased to announce the recipients of the fourth annual Resilience Innovation Grant, a part of the Greening Diplomacy Initiative (GDI) Awards.  Sponsored by the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), the grant provides up to $1 million to help U.S. embassies and consulates address emerging environmental risks for their operations with innovative solutions.  Several projects were also supported by the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs.  Selected projects positively impact the communities the Department operates in and provide tangible examples of sustainable and adaptive interventions.  The Resilience Innovation Grant is a key way the Department strives to meet the White House’s goals on combating the climate crisis, mitigating the financial and operational risks of climate change, and highlights U.S. commitment to climate leadership.</p>
<p>Incorporating a variety of technologies and spanning every region, the nineteen winning projects ranged in size from $3,050 to $187,000.  Energy emerged as a theme, with several winning projects focusing on solar water heaters, LED retrofits, and building infrastructure to support electric vehicles (EVs) at our diplomatic posts.  The winning posts will receive implementation guidance from OBO and the Office of Management Strategy and Solutions (M/SS).</p>
<p>Winning diplomatic posts include Embassy Lusaka, Embassy Mbabane, Embassy Kuala Lumpur, Embassy Manila, Consulate General Surabaya, Embassy Bern, Embassy Singapore, and Embassy Bridgetown which received grants for projects to improve their energy efficiency.  Embassy Dar es Salaam, Embassy Riga, Embassy Manama, Embassy Valletta, and Embassy Tunis received grants to improve their water consumption and implement sustainable gardening practices.  Embassy Singapore, Embassy Oslo, Embassy The Hague, and Consulate General Sao Paulo received grants to build EV infrastructure for charging stations.  Embassy Bishkek received a grant aimed at improving its cycling infrastructure.  Embassy Lima will reduce their waste by installing composting systems.</p>

<p>The text of the following statement was released by the Governments of the United States of America, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p><em>Begin Text:</em></p>
<p>Further to the Negev Summit, held in Sde Boker, Israel in March of this year, at which it was decided to form a framework for regional cooperation (the Negev Forum), the Governments of Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, represented by senior officials from their respective foreign ministries, held the inaugural meeting of the Negev Forum Steering Committee in Manama, Bahrain on June 27, 2022. The Committee’s main objective is to further coordinate our collective efforts and advance a common vision for the region. In this context, we outlined a framework document for the Negev Forum, setting out the objectives of the Forum, and the working methods of its four-part structure: the Foreign Ministers’ Ministerial, the Presidency, the Steering Committee, and the Working Groups.</p>
<p>This meeting demonstrates the strength of our relations, our shared commitment to cooperation, and the important opportunities unlocked by improved relations between Israel and its neighbors, showing what can be achieved by working together to overcome shared challenges. The participants also affirmed that these relations can be harnessed to create momentum in Israeli-Palestinian relations, towards a negotiated resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and as part of efforts to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee discussed the assignment of chairs for each of the six Working Groups launched by the Ministers at the Negev Summit. The Working Groups are to meet regularly throughout the year to advance initiatives that encourage regional integration, cooperation, and development for the benefit of the peoples of the region and across a variety of spheres, including initiatives that strengthen the Palestinian economy and improve the quality of life of Palestinians. The Working Group chairs are expected to regularly report progress to the Steering Committee. Working Group chairs, with the consensus of members, may invite non-member participants to participate in specific initiatives where their participation delivers a direct benefit to the initiative’s stated goal.</p>
<p>The Working Groups are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean Energy</li>
<li>Education and Coexistence</li>
<li>Food and Water Security</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Regional Security</li>
<li>Tourism</li>
</ul>
<p>The Foreign Ministers’ Ministerial, which is expected to convene annually, is to be the principal governing body of the Forum. Israel continues to serve as Negev Forum President until the next Ministerial gathering.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee emphasized that deeper cooperation and improved understanding among our countries is fundamental to the success of the broader region.</p>
<p>We look forward to the next Negev Forum Ministerial meeting later this year, to be preceded by a further meeting of the Steering Committee to be held in Israel.</p>

<p>Today, at the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Schloss Elmau, President Biden laid out the Administration&#8217;s whole of government effort to execute the <a href="https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA2MjYuNTk5MjcwNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9icmllZmluZy1yb29tL3N0YXRlbWVudHMtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi8wNi8yNi9mYWN0LXNoZWV0LXByZXNpZGVudC1iaWRlbi1hbmQtZzctbGVhZGVycy1mb3JtYWxseS1sYXVuY2gtdGhlLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLWZvci1nbG9iYWwtaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUtYW5kLWludmVzdG1lbnQvIn0.VzORQvCE2ebKeZNEU9MtM1HYQ7SpHZTvL8Dk06cBd_w/s/1250718950/br/134137540526-l">Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)</a> to narrow infrastructure gaps around the world, strengthen the global economy and supply chains, and advance international security through strategic investments.  As a key demonstration of this commitment, President Biden announced another milestone in the United States’ support for clean energy innovation as part of global efforts to combat climate change.  The United States is committing $14 million toward a Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) study to provide the basis for the deployment of a small modular reactor (SMR) power plant in Romania.  This action is the next step in fulfilling the pledge made by Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and Romania President Klaus Iohannis at the 2021 UN Conference on Climate Change in Glasgow (COP26), where they announced their intent to deploy an SMR in Romania in partnership with U.S. firm NuScale Power LLC (“NuScale”).</p>
<p>This 8-month effort, expected to cost $28 million in total and to include contributions from Romania SN Nuclearelectrica and NuScale, will provide Romania with key site-specific data – cost, construction, schedule, and licensing details – necessary for the deployment of a NuScale VOYGR<sup>TM</sup>-6 SMR nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry said: “Nuclear energy, including small modular reactors, represent a critical tool in the fight against climate change, and can also enhance energy security and boost economic prosperity.  This is a strong step forward in support of Romania&#8217;s desire to deploy innovative, safe, and zero-emissions nuclear energy in partnership with the United States.”</p>
<p>“This latest commitment demonstrates the strength and importance of Transatlantic relationships in the pursuit of regional security and energy independence,” said Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation Eliot Kang.  “It also underscores the critical need for nuclear energy, carried out under the highest standards of safety, security and nonproliferation, as a key component of the clean energy transition.”</p>
<p>When fully implemented, this multi-billion-dollar effort will showcase the ability of advanced nuclear reactors to replace coal generation with clean, innovative nuclear energy, while creating thousands of jobs, and reaffirming the fact that climate change initiatives and sustainable economic growth go hand-in-hand.  By partnering with the United States, Romania is also ensuring its investments in nuclear energy uphold the highest standards for nuclear safety, security, and nonproliferation, while contributing to the consolidation of energy security in the region.</p>
<p>Enoh T. Ebong, Director of the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, said: “Our partners in Romania and across Eastern Europe require the scaling of existing project preparation efforts to meet the region’s longer-term energy security needs.  This FEED study would build upon USTDA’s existing commitments to deploy cutting-edge U.S. SMR solutions to the region, including grant funding for a study that helped Romania identify and assess several locations where existing coal-fired power plants could be replaced with SMR plants.  Our engagement is having the intended result of creating new business opportunities for U.S. industry in an important market and advancing energy security across the region.”</p>
<p>“Romania is an exemplary partner in our mutual pursuit of Transatlantic peace and security, as well as in global efforts to combat climate change,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Robin Dunnigan.  “Through its pledge to deploy U.S. small modular reactor technology, Romania is not only reinforcing its strong relationship with the United States through civil-nuclear cooperation, but also setting an example for others to follow on the capabilities of clean energy technologies and advanced nuclear reactors to facilitate our transition away from fossil fuels.”</p>
<p>SMRs offer lower costs, more scalability and flexibility than traditional nuclear reactors, and the ability to complement other clean energy sources.  SMRs have a small environmental footprint and can be deployed to match the specific needs of a country’s power grid.  Investing in SMRs creates good paying jobs in host countries and offers the ability to scale-up quickly as demand dictates.</p>

<p>The United States stands with our partners in condemnation of the repeated rocket and mortar attacks directed at the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, including three attacks in Sulaimaniya in the last four days on oil and gas infrastructure. These attacks are designed to undermine economic stability just as they seek to challenge Iraqi sovereignty, sow division, and intimidate. They must be investigated and those responsible must be prosecuted. We continue to stand with the Iraqi people, including our partners in the Kurdistan Region, against this kind of unacceptable violence, and we will continue to seek every opportunity to support Iraq&#8217;s security and prosperity.</p>
