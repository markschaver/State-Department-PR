					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Poland-Ukraine Border</p>
<p align="left"><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Good afternoon, everyone.  The entire world stands with Ukraine, just as I am standing here in Ukraine with my friend, my colleague, Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister of Ukraine.  We’ve seen an extraordinary surgence of support from around the world against Russia’s aggression – against Russia’s war of choice, against what is happening every single day, every single minute in Ukraine to civilians throughout the country as a result of this aggression – but also extraordinary support for Ukraine itself.</p>
<p>We’ve come from several days of meetings with NATO, the European Union, countries beyond the G7, and we see that support not only continue – security support, humanitarian support, economic support – but that support will increase.  And as to the pressure on Russia, not only is it unprecedented, not only is it producing very, very concrete results in Russia, but that pressure too will not only continue – it will grow until this war, this war of choice, is brought to an end.</p>
<p>I have to say that I’m in awe of my friend, his entire government, President Zelenskyy.  The courage that they are showing every day, the leadership that they are showing to the world, it’s inspiring.  And the world is here; the world is with you.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:  </b>Thank you.  Well, first of all, I would like to thank Tony for coming here to Ukraine – literally – we just crossed the line and we are standing here.  I hope the people of Ukraine will be able to see this as a clear manifestation that we have friends who literally stayed – stand by us.  Thank you for your leadership in consolidating international community in support of Ukraine.  We had meaningful discussions about weapons, about sanctions, about isolation of Russia on the international arena.</p>
<p>And the message that I have to convey, that I would like to convey now, is very simple.  Ukraine will win this war anyway, because this is the people’s war for their land, and we defend the right cause.  The question is the price, the price of our victory.  And if our partners continue to take bold, systemic decisions to step up economic and political pressure on Ukraine, if they continue to provide us with necessary weapons, the price will be lower.  This will save many lives in Ukraine, many houses.  Many children will be born.  Many sufferings will be avoided.  This is the only question that is on the agenda.  If anyone in the world one day starts feeling the sanctions fatigue, for example, then people – more people in Ukraine will be dying, suffering, and more destruction will be brought on us by Russian airplanes and by Russian weapons.</p>
<p>So we appreciate everything that has been done in the last week – unprecedented, swift reaction to the Russian aggression.  But it has to be continued, the pressure has to be stepped up, and Ukraine has to be provided with all weapons necessary to fight in this, as Tony said, war of choice of President Putin.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Minister, what kind of weapons do you need from the U.S. that you aren’t getting?</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:  </b>Well, we are satisfied with the already-arranged supplies of anti-tank weapons and ammunition – this is one of the most badly needed – and we destroy a lot of Russian tanks and armored vehicles using weapons that came from our friends, including the United States.  It’s no secret that the highest demand that we have is in fighting jets, attack aircrafts, and air defense systems. We thank all those countries, including the United States, who provided us the – with Stingers.  We effectively use them, and just today we shot down three Russian attack aircrafts, which were bombing our cities, with the use of Stingers.  But we need to, how to say, big air defense systems to ensure the safety of our skies.  If we lose the skies, there will be much, much more blood on the ground, and that will be the blood of civilians.  And I don’t want anyone to share responsibility for their blood, anyone in the world to share responsibility for their deaths and suffering.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Mr. Minister &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Sir, are you still calling for a no-fly zone?</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:  </b>Yes, yes, and we will continue to call.  I understand – I hear the messages.  I heard was the NATO secretary general said yesterday after the meeting of the Allies.  I regret – I think it’s a sign of weakness by – of NATO.  We’ve been saying many things for the last eight years about Russia, about intentions.  We were never heard.  Everyone was saying you’re – many were saying: you’re exaggerating; this is not going to happen.  People were – then at certain points, some countries were saying: no, we can never supply you with weapons.  But in the last eight days, the world politics were shattered by the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and those countries who had never supplied us with weapons are now doing so.</p>
<p>So I’m used to it.  We are now in the phase where NATO is saying: no, we’re going to not – we are not going to do that.  The time will come.  It’s, again, the issue of price.  We do not – it’s Ukrainians, it’s the people of Ukraine who pay the price for the reluctance of NATO to act.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Mr. Minister, could you tell us how the talks with the Russians are going, how any kind of negotiations are going?  And also, when you talk about the cost, even at what point that the fighting ends, what kind of country will the – Ukrainians go back to?  What will it look like?</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:  </b>Ukrainians will go back to the country to some – to a large extent destroyed by Russian bombers and artillery and rockets.  But then we will roll our sleeves up and we will build an even more beautiful country.  We are all committed to that and we will all take part in that.</p>
<p>When it comes to the talks with Russians, I cannot say that there is any progress in it.  We all hope that the humanitarian corridors, which were agreed upon during the last talks, would work.  Unfortunately, at least as we speak, they – these humanitarian corridors are not available because of the Russian fire and shellings.  But every war ends with diplomacy and with talks, so we have to continue talking, but we are not going to these talks to accept Russian ultimatums.  Again, trust me, thousands of people in Ukraine sacrifice their lives – men, women, old, young – to defend the country.  When we prevail – and I have no doubt in that – we will build a new Ukraine, and that country will be even better than the one that Russia destroyed.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:  </b>Thank you all very much</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Off-mike.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Secretary Blinken, (inaudible) &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>He asked for fighter and attack aircraft.  Would you help your friend and partner, the Minister Kuleba, with fighter and attack aircraft?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We are talking about and working on everything.  We’re doing that; Secretary of Defense Austin and his counterpart Mr. Reznikov are doing that.  We are, again, looking at everything, and as I said before, the support for Ukraine not only has been unprecedented, not only is it going to continue – it’s going to increase.  And what we’ve seen, I think, as Dmytro said, is a sea change, and a sea change that’s being shown around the world in terms of its support.  There’s a very, very strong tide in support of Ukraine and against the horrific aggression committed by Russia.</p>
<p>Putin has made a terrible, terrible, terrible mistake in many ways, but it starts with the proposition that somehow Ukraine doesn’t exist as an independent country.  What Ukrainians are showing every single day is, of course, exactly the opposite.  And ultimately, their strength, their resolve, their determination, backed by the United States and backed by the world, is going to prevail.  It’s as simple and straightforward as that.  But Dmytro’s right: at what price?  We want to do everything we can to make sure that that price is as low as possible and that this happens as quickly as possible, but we’re in it with Ukraine one way or another.  The short-run, the medium-run, the long-run. We’re in this together. We will succeed together. Ukraine is going to prevail.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:  </b>Thank you all very much.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Rzeszow, Poland</p>
<p>Bristol Hotel</p>
<p align="left"><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Ladies and gentlemen, time for statements, and – for information, there won’t be any questions after the statements because of limited time.  Minister Rau, floor is yours.<b></b></p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER RAU:</b>  Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen, we meeting – our meeting with Secretary, State Secretary Blinken, was devoted to coordinating actions in response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, as well as political, economic, social, and humanitarian consequences of Russia’s war on our neighboring countries.  In the discussion with Secretary Blinken, we raised the most important issues arising from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Poland’s two eastern neighbors, both for Polish-American bilateral relations and for Allied cooperation between NATO, as well as for the coordination of political activities in the OSCE.<b></b></p>
<p>Poland will never recognize territorial changes brought about by unprovoked, unlawful aggression.  The way in which Russia conducts hostilities, based on the desire to break the will of Ukrainian resistance by means of attacks that terrorize civilian population – shelling residential areas, nuclear power plants, and non-military venues – are war crimes under international law which are not subjected to statute of limitation and will be prosecuted with utmost determination.<b></b></p>
<p>I call on Russia to refrain from attacks on civilian populations.  I call both parties to abide by international humanitarian law and to treat prisoners of war with dignity.  Turning over all war criminals must be considered in future peace negotiations.<b></b></p>
<p>Due to its own painful experience in the past, Poland will consequently demand prosecuting war criminals.  This is our historic debt to inhabitants of Guernica and (inaudible), whose sacrifices can never be forgotten.  Pursuing war criminals is an element of humankind’s common memory.  It’s our common obligation.  To achieve this, Poland (inaudible) center for documentation of war crimes in Ukraine.  We discussed possibilities for Polish-American cooperation in this area.</p>
<p>I call for an end of the bloodshed and ceasefire for the duration of the talks between Ukraine and Russia.  In my capacity as OSCE chairman in office, I welcomed understanding for recreation of humanitarian corridors that will facilitate the evacuation of civilians from Ukrainian cities under siege.  Along with the majority of OSCE countries, I appealed for this from the outset of the conflict.  I view this understanding as a ray of hope to prevent more Ukrainian civilians from falling victim to war.  Everything possible must be done to ensure they evacuate.</p>
<p>Russia’s aggression in Ukraine caused a humanitarian crisis of an unimaginable scale.  Our priority is organizing effective aid to hundreds of thousands and soon be millions of refugees.  Poland already received up to 700,000 refugees, and we will continue to do so for everyone that needs it, regardless of a nationality, race, (inaudible) religious creed.</p>
<p>The attack on Ukraine already transformed Europe and its sense of security.  Poland decided to immediately increase its defense spending budget to 3 percent of its GDP beginning next year.  As a key country for deterring and defending NATO’s eastern flank, Poland’s (inaudible) welcomed the Alliance’s swift reaction to the new strategic circumstances.  I’ve conveyed to Secretary Blinken my thanks to President Biden for his effective leadership in coordinating an explicit, united, and effective response from the transatlantic community and (inaudible) to Russia’s aggression.</p>
<p>As a host country for NATO response force on the eastern flank, Poland plays a critical role in this reaction, and we are determined to abide by it.  In line with the charter of the United Nations, Poland will provide all possible support to Ukraine, who is currently defending itself from an unlawful (inaudible) unprovoked aggression.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Secretary Blinken.<b></b></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.  Zbigniew, I want to thank you as always for the very good exchange, for the very warm welcome.  And we were just at NATO together, we were in Washington together just a few weeks ago, and it’s very good to to be here with you.</p>
<p>I’m also especially pleased that Ambassador Brzezinski is now here in Poland, credentialed last month.  The timing could not be better.  It’s vital that we have all of our confirmed ambassadors in place at this critical time.</p>
<p>And we are, in fact, meeting at one of the most urgent moments in the long history of friendship between our countries.</p>
<p>As Allies and partners, Poland and the United States have stood together through many, many challenges.  Now the very ideals that bind us – freedom, democracy, peace, security – are under threat in this region as never before, certainly not since the Second World War.</p>
<p>The people of Poland know how important it is to defend freedom.  So do Americans.  And we will stand together, as we’ve been standing together, in support of Ukraine and against Russia’s unprovoked, unwarranted, premeditated invasion.</p>
<p>In NATO, the European Union, the OSCE – where Zbigniew is the chair in office this year – Poland is doing vital work to respond to this crisis.  It’s hosted an increased NATO presence.  It supported the robust EU sanctions against Russia.  And it has done a great deal to facilitate security assistance to Ukraine.</p>
<p>As NATO Allies, defense cooperation between Poland and the United States, I think it’s safe to say, is closer than it’s ever been.  Since January 30th, the United States has more than doubled the number of our military personnel deployed in Poland to now more than 10,000, including a brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division.  And we’ve significantly increased the amount and types of military equipment and capabilities that we’ve positioned in Poland. As President Biden has said, we will defend every inch of NATO territory.</p>
<p>Poland is also a leading responder to the humanitarian crisis that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked.  As Zbigniew just said, as of today, more than 700,000 people have been forced to flee the violence perpetrated by Russia by crossing the border from Ukraine to Poland, with more coming every single day.  I’m going to have the opportunity to speak to some of the folks who’ve come over just recently from Ukraine, but I have to say it’s an incredibly powerful reflection of Poland’s values that vulnerable people know that here, they will find refuge.</p>
<p>To help support the needs of Ukrainians in Poland and other countries, the Biden administration just requested of Congress 2.5 – excuse me, $2.75 billion in humanitarian assistance.  That’s both to meet the need of vulnerable people and communities inside Ukraine as well as to support refugee services, including here in Poland.  That’s in addition to the more than $54 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine that we announced just last week</p>
<p>We also sent a Disaster Assistance Response Team to Poland, working very closely with humanitarian agencies to provide the critical health care, safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene supplies, protection for vulnerable people, especially women and children.</p>
<p>We’ve delivered nearly 20,000 thermal blankets suited for cold climates; we’ve provided funding for emergency supplies to sustain health care for up to 100,000 people for three months and up to 500 emergency surgical procedures.</p>
<p>Embassy Kyiv has temporarily relocated to Poland as well, and I’m grateful for that, that Poland is hosting them.  They and our embassies and consulates in Poland and across the region are working hard to assist American citizens and their families departing Ukraine and to help them with the influx of U.S. military personnel, humanitarian workers, as well as assistance.  We established a U.S. Welcome Center close to the Ukrainian border.  It’s been operating 24/7 since hostilities began.  We have support teams as well stationed near the border in Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Moldova, to assist any Americans who are leaving Ukraine.</p>
<p>At this moment of crisis for millions of Ukrainians – and as the security of Europe hangs in the balance – Poland has stepped forward with generosity, with leadership, with resolve.  We’re grateful for the strong foundation of friendship and cooperation that we’ve built together over many, many decades, which so many are now relying on today.  Thank you.</p>

<p>And we are, in fact, meeting at one of the most urgent moments in the long history of friendship between our countries.</p>
<p>As Allies and partners, Poland and the United States have stood together through many, many challenges.  Now the very ideals that bind us – freedom, democracy, peace, security – are under threat in this region as never before, certainly not since the Second World War.</p>
<p>The people of Poland know how important it is to defend freedom.  So do Americans.  And we will stand together, as we’ve been standing together, in support of Ukraine and against Russia’s unprovoked, unwarranted, premeditated invasion.</p>
<p>In NATO, the European Union, the OSCE – where Zbigniew is the chair in office this year – Poland is doing vital work to respond to this crisis.  It’s hosted an increased NATO presence.  It supported the robust EU sanctions against Russia.  And it has done a great deal to facilitate security assistance to Ukraine.</p>
<p>As NATO Allies, defense cooperation between Poland and the United States, I think it’s safe to say, is closer than it’s ever been.  Since January 30th, the United States has more than doubled the number of our military personnel deployed in Poland to now more than 10,000, including a brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division.  And we’ve significantly increased the amount and types of military equipment and capabilities that we’ve positioned in Poland. As President Biden has said, we will defend every inch of NATO territory.</p>
<p>Poland is also a leading responder to the humanitarian crisis that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked.  As Zbigniew just said, as of today, more than 700,000 people have been forced to flee the violence perpetrated by Russia by crossing the border from Ukraine to Poland, with more coming every single day.  I’m going to have the opportunity to speak to some of the folks who’ve come over just recently from Ukraine, but I have to say it’s an incredibly powerful reflection of Poland’s values that vulnerable people know that here, they will find refuge.</p>
<p>To help support the needs of Ukrainians in Poland and other countries, the Biden administration just requested of Congress 2.5 – excuse me, $2.75 billion in humanitarian assistance.  That’s both to meet the need of vulnerable people and communities inside Ukraine as well as to support refugee services, including here in Poland.  That’s in addition to the more than $54 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine that we announced just last week</p>
<p>We also sent a Disaster Assistance Response Team to Poland, working very closely with humanitarian agencies to provide the critical health care, safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene supplies, protection for vulnerable people, especially women and children.</p>
<p>We’ve delivered nearly 20,000 thermal blankets suited for cold climates; we’ve provided funding for emergency supplies to sustain health care for up to 100,000 people for three months and up to 500 emergency surgical procedures.</p>
<p>Embassy Kyiv has temporarily relocated to Poland as well, and I’m grateful for that, that Poland is hosting them.  They and our embassies and consulates in Poland and across the region are working hard to assist American citizens and their families departing Ukraine and to help them with the influx of U.S. military personnel, humanitarian workers, as well as assistance.  We established a U.S. Welcome Center close to the Ukrainian border.  It’s been operating 24/7 since hostilities began.  We have support teams as well stationed near the border in Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Moldova, to assist any Americans who are leaving Ukraine.</p>
<p>At this moment of crisis for millions of Ukrainians – and as the security of Europe hangs in the balance – Poland has stepped forward with generosity, with leadership, with resolve.  We’re grateful for the strong foundation of friendship and cooperation that we’ve built together over many, many decades, which so many are now relying on today.  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p align="left">Since President Putin launched his unprovoked, unjustified, and unconscionable invasion of Ukraine over a week ago, the international community across continents has spoken with powerful unity to denounce Russia’s aggression and demand its cessation. Giving voice and purpose to that common cause requires ready international venues such as the United Nations, where the Russian government and its dwindling supporters cannot impede scrutiny of their actions.</p>
<p align="left">One of President Biden’s early foreign policy priorities was to reestablish American leadership at the United Nations and other international organizations, where our values, security, and prosperity could be protected and advanced. The success of that effort can clearly be seen in this week’s remarkable series of multilateral actions.</p>
<p align="left">In the UN Security Council on February 25, the United States and Albania introduced a resolution co-sponsored by an additional 80 UN member states demanding an end to the invasion and making clear that Russia alone bears responsibility for the ongoing violence.  Russia’s veto of that resolution only underscored its growing international isolation.  As U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield stated after the vote, “Russia cannot veto the UN Charter.  Russia cannot, and will not, veto accountability.”</p>
<p align="left">That action was followed quickly by a February 27 Security Council vote to call for an Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly on Ukraine.  That Special Session resulted in an unprecedented repudiation of Russia and its horrific assault on the people of Ukraine and Ukraine’s sovereignty.  One hundred forty-one UN Member States, from all regions, voted in support of a resolution condemning Russia’s aggression and calling for an immediate end to its invasion.  At the end of two days of discussion, Russia could only assemble a rogue’s gallery of four nations to support its unconscionable actions and false narratives.</p>
<p align="left">On Friday, the UN Human Rights Council concluded an Urgent Debate on the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine.  The Council voted overwhelmingly to demand that Russia halt its assault on the Ukrainian people.  Russia stood virtually isolated.  The resolution establishes the highest level of scrutiny the Council can create: a Commission of Inquiry.  This powerful investigative mechanism will ensure that Russia’s horrific conduct in Ukraine is carefully and verifiably documented so those responsible, like President Putin, can be held to account.</p>
<p align="left">We and our partners and allies are also raising Russia’s aggression in every corner of the UN system and in related international organizations, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, International Civil Aviation Organization, and International Maritime Organization. Our message in all these bodies is clear: there can be no business as usual so long as Russia wages this brutal war on its neighbor.</p>
<p align="left">Multilateral diplomacy can at times frustrate even the most determined of diplomats.  But, when faced with such naked contempt for peace and security, the nations of the world took action to unite and isolate the aggressor.  The powerful display of international solidarity and collective action demonstrates the unique role and indispensability of multilateral organizations like the United Nations to effectively respond against threats to the rules-based international order.  This is not only a time to appreciate the role of the United Nations, but it is also an opportunity to strengthen and revitalize the international system to prevent such aggression in the future.</p>
<p align="left">As President Biden has said: “An overwhelming majority of nations recognize that Putin is not only attacking Ukraine, he is attacking the very foundations of global peace and security—and everything the United Nations stands for.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p>The Hotel</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Secretary Blinken, how do you think the war in Ukraine will play out?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  It’s very hard to predict and to project going forward.  I think that what we can say is this:  We’ve seen extraordinary, extraordinary resilience coming from the Ukrainian people defending their country, defending their freedom, defending their future.  And I think in that sense, the war has certainly not gone as President Putin might have thought it and might have planned.</p>
<p>What that tells us about the future, I can’t say.  But what I can say, as well, is having spent here in Brussels a day with NATO Allies and partners, the European Union, G7, the commitment of the international community to do everything we can to help Ukraine defend itself and also to put excruciating pressure on Russia to end this war of choice that Vladimir Putin started is real, strong, and will have an impact.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  But do you think that Ukraine’s defeat is inevitable?  It might take time, but that eventually, the sheer weight of Russian military force will prevail?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, there’s an old saying that the only things that are inevitable in life are death and taxes, so I don’t think anything is inevitable.  But of course, it’s true that the weight of the Russian military, if it puts everything into it, far exceeds that of what Ukraine’s able to muster.  But I don’t think you can fully evaluate what the will of the Ukrainian people is and the impact that that has.</p>
<p>And think about it this way too:  If it’s the intention of Moscow to try somehow to topple the government and install its own puppet regime, 45 million Ukrainians are going to reject that one way or the other.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  So you’re convinced they can win?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Over time, absolutely.  I can’t tell you how long this will go on.  I can’t tell you how long it will take.  But the idea that Russia can subjugate to its will 45 million people who are ardently, ardently fighting for their future and their freedom that does not involve Russia having its thumb on Ukraine, that tells you a lot.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  How great is the risk of escalation?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The risk of escalation is certainly real.  It’s something that we care about and are focused on because the only thing worse than a war that’s contained to Ukraine is one that escalates even further and goes beyond it.  It’s exactly why, among other things, NATO has been so focused on reinforcing its defense and deterrence.  We’ve taken historic steps to reinforce the eastern flank of NATO to make sure that the Article 5 commitment has everything it needs to back it up.  And just as NATO and the United States have never sought nor will we seek a war with Russia – we’re a defensive alliance – equally, we’re committed to defending every single inch of NATO territory if it comes under attack.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  But do you fear escalation to a wider European war or do you fear escalation – the use of chemical or biological weapons?  What is it that worries you?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, the main concern right now, of course, is further escalation inside Ukraine itself.  We know the methods that President Putin has used in the past, whether it was in Chechnya, whether it was in Syria, whether it was in Ukraine itself back in 2014.  And what we’re seeing now in the last couple of days is the increasingly brutal use of force directed at civilians, civilian populations.  We’re seeing tremendous humanitarian suffering as a result.  We’re seeing Russia go after critical infrastructure that’s denying Ukrainians water, denying them electricity, denying them heat.  And those methods are, unfortunately, tragically, part of the Russian playbook under President Putin.  And I think we’re likely to see more of that.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Do you think Vladimir Putin is rational or delusional?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I can’t put myself in President Putin’s mindset at all, but all I can do is two things: gauge Russia and President Putin by their actions and do everything we can to respond effectively.  But here’s one thing we do know:  What’s extraordinary is the extent to which virtually everything President Putin over the years has said he wants to prevent, he has, in fact, precipitated by his actions.  What we’re seeing now is the very alliance that he wants to try to blow apart, NATO, coming together in ways that we haven’t seen in years or even decades; a Ukrainian people that he wants to subjugate united in their opposition to Russia.  He has turned – in 2014, before Russia first went into Ukraine, to Crimea, to the Donbas, actually attitudes toward Russia in Ukraine were largely positive.  Now, 90 percent of the people hate Russia because of what President Putin’s done.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  But at the moment, his forces are on the rampage in Ukraine.  Is there any diplomatic solution to this?  What is the U.S. prepared to offer as an offramp, to use the American phrase?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  We’ll always look for opportunities for diplomacy and for dialogue.  In fact, that’s exactly what we did in the months leading up to this war of choice.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  But do you think it’s actually possible now, despite the status of the conflict, actually?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  It depends entirely on President Putin and on Russia.  If they show any signs of being willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy, of course, we’ll engage.  We look to our Ukrainian partners too.  They are talking to the Russians, but that’s not producing anything.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  But are you prepared to say, look, if there’s a ceasefire, we will talk about the status of Crimea, of the Donbas, maybe discuss neutrality in those kind of things?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  We’ve made very clear that there are certain basic principles at stake that we are determined to defend.  And those principles include basic propositions that have basically undergirded peace and security for years, ever since the Second World War: one nation can’t dictate to another its policies, its choices, with whom it will associate, among others; one nation can’t exert a sphere of influence that subjugates another country to its will.  So no matter what, we’re going to uphold those principles.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any way forward that involves diplomacy is first and foremost going to be up to the Ukrainian people and the government that represents it democratically, and we will support whatever direction they want to go in.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  One way of resolving this would be regime change in Moscow.  Is that something you seek?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  We don’t seek that, and in any event it’s not up to us.  The Russian people need to decide their leadership.  They need to decide whether the leaders that are there are actually advancing and representing their needs, their interests, their will.  That’s absolutely not up to us.</p>
<p>What I would say to the Russian people is: How in the world is this war of aggression – unprovoked, unwarranted – on Ukraine, how in the world is that advancing your interests, your needs?  How is it sending a kid to school?  How is it getting you a job?  How is it cleaning the air?  How is it dealing with the things that you care about?  It’s doing nothing for them.  On the contrary, tragically for the Russian people, they are bearing the burden of so much of this because the world has come together to put these massive sanctions on Putin and on Russia.  They’re bearing the consequence.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Final thought.  You have made it very clear there’ll be no NATO, no U.S. intervention on the ground, no no-fly zone.  But what do you say to the people of Ukraine who are just saying we just want protection from these Russian missiles, these rockets?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  We’re walking – working and talking to the government every single day about their needs, what we can do that would be – help them be even more effective in defending Ukraine against this Russian onslaught.  Over the last year, the United States – I’ll just speak for the United States – we’ve provided more than a billion dollars in security assistance to Ukraine, more than in any previous year.  That continues as we speak.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  But that’s not saving lives.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, I – it’s very hard to – hard to demonstrate it &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Or is &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Very hard to demonstrate a negative.  The Ukrainians have been extraordinarily effective first and foremost because of their extraordinary courage and determination, but they’ve also had some means to do that.  And as I said, every day we’re working with them, working with European partners and allies, to determine what they need and what they can effectively use and how we can get it to them.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.  Good to be with you.  Thanks.</p>

<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Or is &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Very hard to demonstrate a negative.  The Ukrainians have been extraordinarily effective first and foremost because of their extraordinary courage and determination, but they’ve also had some means to do that.  And as I said, every day we’re working with them, working with European partners and allies, to determine what they need and what they can effectively use and how we can get it to them.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.  Good to be with you.  Thanks.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, good evening, everyone.  We’re in Brussels at a pivotal time.  Stability in Europe hangs in the balance.  And the international rules-based order that’s critical to maintaining peace and security is being put to the test by Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Kremlin’s attacks are inflicting an ever-increasing toll on civilians there.  Hundreds if not thousands of Ukrainians have been killed, many more wounded, as have citizens of other countries.  More than a million refugees have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries.  Millions of people across Ukraine are trapped in increasingly dire conditions as Russia destroys more critical infrastructure.  For example, Mariupol’s mayor says that most of the besieged city’s residents are living without water, without electricity, without heat.  Bridges to the city have been destroyed.  Women, children, growing ranks of wounded civilians cannot get out.  Food and medical supplies cannot get in.  The mayor wrote today, and I quote, “We are simply being destroyed.”  The world has seen Russia use these grisly tactics before in Syria, in Chechnya.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia’s reckless operation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant risked a catastrophe, a nuclear incident.  The Kremlin should immediately cease all attacks around Ukrainian nuclear facilities and allow civilian personnel to do their work to ensure the facility’s safety and security, as both the IAEA director general and a resolution adopted yesterday by the agency’s board of governors have called on Russia to do.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian people and government continue to show remarkable courage in defending their country, defending their freedom, defending one another.  We said that if President Putin invaded Ukraine, we would increase our support for Ukraine’s ability to defend itself while imposing swift and severe costs on the Kremlin.  That’s exactly what the United States and our allies and partners are doing.  That was the focus of our ministerial meetings today with NATO Allies, with the G7, with the European Union, as well as in my discussions with the NATO secretary general, with the EU Commission President von der Leyen, with the EU Council President Michel.</p>
<p>We want our alliances to be strong enough to meet any threat.  That’s why from day one, President Biden made reinvigorating and re-energizing our alliances and partnerships the foundation of our foreign policy.  It’s why as Secretary of State I’ve come to Brussels, home to NATO and the EU, more than to any other world capital.  And that’s why we invested so much effort in finding new ways and coalitions to bring allies and partners together.  Now we’re seeing why that work matters.</p>
<p>At NATO, we were joined by the ministers of Finland and Sweden, the EU High Representative Josep Borrell, the foreign ministers of Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and Canada, as well as Secretary General Stoltenberg also took part in our meeting with the EU.  Never before have NATO and the European Union and other partner nations worked so closely together.  This is a new kind of cooperation, and we’ll bring this to bear not just in this crisis but in the years to come.</p>
<p>And our European allies and partners are stepping up to lead in unprecedented ways.  For the first time, NATO has activated and deployed parts of its response force.  Several NATO Allies, including the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, France, have sent troops and aircraft and ships to reinforce the Alliance’s eastern flank.  Every NATO Ally is providing either military or humanitarian aid to Ukraine; most are providing both.  For the first time, the European Union is financing the purchase and delivery of military assistance to a country under attack.  The bloc swiftly adopted the biggest sanctions package in history against Russia, and the EU has granted immediate refuge to Ukrainians and others who call Ukraine home – the first time it has invoked this protection mechanism.</p>
<p>Individual countries are also taking extraordinary steps.  Germany is doubling its defense spending.  Poland has opened its arms to more than half a million Ukrainian refugees.  Switzerland set aside its traditional neutrality to adopt the European Union sanctions on Russia.  The list goes on.</p>
<p>These and other efforts by our European allies to deepen their own capabilities and cooperation do not undermine the transatlantic security alliance – they deepen our collective might.</p>
<p>As recently as a few weeks ago, some questioned whether – if the regional and international rules-based order came under threat – whether our European allies and partners would be willing to shoulder their fair share of the burden – the risk, the cost – to defend it.  In the last nine days, European countries have demonstrated they are more than ready to stand up and stand together.</p>
<p>And the United States is standing with Europe, pursuing complementary actions and policies in close coordination with our allies and partners.  To give just a few examples, we’ve deployed an additional 7,000 troops to Europe and repositioned our forces already on the continent to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank.  We continue to tighten our severe economic sanctions on Russia.  Last night, as I think you know, we extended Temporary Protected Status to tens of thousands of Ukrainians living in the United States.  And the President has requested an additional $10 billion from Congress to deliver more humanitarian, security, and economic assistance in Ukraine and the surrounding region over the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, President Putin said his so-called “special military operation” is proceeding exactly as planned.  Well, it’s hard to imagine that his plan included inspiring the Ukrainian people to defend their country with such tenacity; strengthening the resolve and solidarity of NATO and the EU; uniting the world in opposition to Moscow, including 141 countries at the United Nations; an unprecedented number of international businesses, associations, cultural institutions that have cut ties with Russia; causing the Russian economy to go into freefall; motivating tens of thousands of Russians to protest and countless more to leave the country; and increasingly turning Russia into a pariah state.  If that was President Putin’s plan, well, you can say it’s working.  Russia has never been so isolated; we have never been more united.</p>
<p>But let me reiterate one thing because it’s very important:  We take these actions not because we oppose the Russian people – we do not.  We regret that tens of millions of Russians will suffer because of the dangerous decisions made by a tiny circle of corrupt leaders and their cronies who have consistently put their interests above those of the Russian people, who are doing everything they can to hide their war of choice from the Russian public.</p>
<p>Today’s discussion with NATO, the EU, the G7 affirmed that we’re fully aligned on our goals and our determination to meet them.  We’ll deepen our support for Ukraine’s brave defenders and for the Ukrainian civilians suffering as a result of the deepening humanitarian crisis.  We’ll continue to raise the cost of President Putin and all who carry out and enable his war of choice and the devastation that it’s causing.  We’ll continue to strengthen our capacity to defend our collective security and deter further escalation by Russia, including by upholding our Article 5 commitment that an attack on one is an attack on all.  NATO is a defensive Alliance.  We’ve never sought and will not seek conflict with Russia.  But as President Biden has said, we will defend every inch of NATO territory.  No one should doubt America’s readiness or our resolve.</p>
<p>At the same time, we’ll keep open the door to dialogue and diplomacy while making clear to the Kremlin that unless it changes course, it will continue down the road of increasing isolation and economic pain.  And we’ll support Ukraine in its talks with Russia to reach a ceasefire and the unconditional withdrawal of Russian forces, something that Foreign Minister Kuleba and I have been discussing on a daily basis.  In the meantime, we are working urgently with the Government of Ukraine, the ICRC, and others to create humanitarian corridors that will allow civilians to get out of Ukraine’s besieged cities and to allow food, medicine, and other vital supplies to get in.  Russia’s attack created this humanitarian crisis.  Now, all countries have a responsibility to pressure the Kremlin to alleviate at least some of the misery that it has wrought.</p>
<p>Of all the consequences of Moscow’s unprovoked attack, one of the most unexpected is the spark it has lit in people around the world who have come out to demonstrate for freedom, for the rights of Ukrainians.  That includes valiant individuals in places where protesting the Kremlin’s war means risking arrest, beatings, or worse, as thousands of Russians and Belarusians have done.  For years, we’ve seen the dangerous tide rolling back democracy and human rights and undercutting the rules-based order, fueled in no small part by Moscow.  With this brutal invasion, we, our European allies and partners, and people everywhere are being reminded of just how much is at stake.  Now, we see the tide of democracy rising to the moment.</p>
<p>With that, I’m happy to take some questions.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:  </b>Paul Handley, AFP.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Hi, Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Hey, Paul.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>You’ve – the West has put unprecedented sanctions on Russia, very punishing, yet it doesn’t seem to have slowed the Russian military’s advance on Ukraine.  Today NATO seemed to forswear absolutely putting in a no-fly zone that might protect the Ukrainians.  Given that, nothing seems to slow this invasion.  What can you tell the Ukrainian people who only see things getting worse, seeing a disaster, seeing more suffering, and are pleading for more help from the West?</p>
<p>And I have a little follow-up.  I could ask it now or in a moment.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>No, go ahead, please.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>The West, NATO, has been involved in this in terms of supplying a lot of arms, which you’ve mentioned, to Ukraine.  Can’t it supply more effective arms, larger weapons?  Jets has been – have been talked about.  NATO is engaged in this.  Can’t it do more for Ukraine?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you.  Let me take the second part first.  We’re in constant contact with Ukraine, with government officials and leaders on their needs, and in constant contact and coordination with allies and partners on providing for those needs when it comes to security assistance.</p>
<p>We’ve already been engaged in a remarkable effort, just speaking for the United States, with the various drawdowns that President Biden has done.  We’ve provided, over the past year and change, more than a billion dollars in security assistance to Ukraine.  The most recent drawdown that was issued by the President of $350 million, we have already sent into Ukraine about $250 million worth of that drawdown.  So this is happening every single day, and you’re seeing the means that Ukraine needs to defend itself get into the hands of Ukrainians who are doing that.</p>
<p>Having said that, one of the things that we talked about at length today in our various meetings at NATO and the EU was what more we can do and how to do it effectively.  I would add that, I think as you know, Foreign Minister Kuleba actually came into our meetings by video; we heard from him directly some of the additional things that Ukraine is looking for.  We’re working on all of that every single day.</p>
<p>We’re also a week and change into this horrific war wrought by Russia.  We’ve had already a dramatic impact, far beyond, I think, what anyone would have expected on Russia and its economy.  The ruble is trading at its weakest levels ever.  It’s worth less than a penny.  Russian authorities are expecting exporters to sell at least 80 percent of the foreign currency that they have to prop up what is a rapidly weakening currency.  The stock market’s been closed for days due to a fear of capital flight once it opens.  This is the longest stretch of emergency closure since Russia defaulted back in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The CBR has more than doubled their key interest rate – the central bank – to 20 percent, the highest in almost 20 years.  Capital controls, et cetera.  We’re seeing – I have a list five pages long of all the businesses that have left Russia.  But this take – the impact is there.  It’s powerful, it’s real, and it is building.  So let’s see how Russia responds to that as this really takes hold and takes a grip.</p>
<p>Second, as we’ve been demonstrating by not only what we’ve been saying but what we’ve been doing, the support for Ukraine is real, profound, extensive – the security assistance that we just talked about that continues to go in, the humanitarian support that we continue to build in response to the humanitarian horror that Russia has wrought, as well as economic assistance.  Unfortunately, this is not like flipping a light switch.  It takes time.  And when you have, in the case of Russia and President Putin’s Russia a country that is prepared to go to excessive means to achieve its results, it is a real challenge.</p>
<p>But not only are we at it every day, I think what the Ukrainian people can see is virtually the entire world united in support of them, in support of their cause of independence, territorial integrity, freedom, demonstrated by the meetings we had today, demonstrated by the 141 countries that came together at the United Nations to make that clear.  So there is a huge tide of support for Ukraine.  There is a huge weight bearing down on Russia.  Let’s see what the impact is.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  Méabh McMahon, Euronews.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hi, there.  Thank you so much for this.  Méabh McMahon, Euronews.  So we heard this morning at NATO that the situation will get worse before it gets better.  So tell us:  What do you know that we don’t?  And is the no to the no-fly zone set in stone completely, or would you consider it if this conflict does become a massacre?</p>
<p>And just a follow-up, Was it naïve of you and of course the Europeans to trust in Putin to opt for diplomacy?  Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  When we say it is likely to get worse, it’s unfortunately based on everything we know about President Putin’s methods when it comes to seeking to subjugate another country to his will or another region to his will.  We saw it in Chechnya.  We’ve seen it in Syria.  We saw it, of course, in 2014 in Ukraine.  And what we’re seeing on the battlefield is Russian forces seeking to encircle the major cities, including Kyiv, and we’re seeing them use increasingly brutal methods, including going at civilians and civilian populations.</p>
<p>So I think the terrible expectation is that the suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better for as long as Russia pursues these methods.  So that is unfortunately more likely than not, although we are doing everything we can to try to move this to a different track.</p>
<p>With regard to the no-fly zone, I think you heard NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg speak to this earlier today.  One of the responsibilities we have, even as we are doing everything we can to give the Ukrainian people the means to defend themselves effectively against Russia, we also have a responsibility, as the secretary general said, to ensure that the war doesn’t spill over even beyond Ukraine.  And again, because I think he put it so well, as he noted, the only way to actually implement something like a no-fly zone is to send NATO planes into Ukrainian airspace and to shoot down Russian planes, and that could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe.</p>
<p>President Biden has been clear that we are not going to get into a war with Russia.  But we are going to tremendous lengths with allies and partners to provide the Ukrainians with the means to effectively defend themselves.  And of course we’re seeing every single day their extraordinary heroism as well as very, very real results in what they’re doing to achieve that.</p>
<p>And I’m sorry, I missed the last part of your question.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Just do you feel like – remember we spoke together last spring when you were here in Brussels at the NATO Headquarters, and I feel the question now is: Do you feel that you were naïve or the Europeans were naïve to trust in Putin that he would come to the table and he would choose diplomacy over this invasion?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, I’ll only speak for the United States.  I think we were the opposite of naïve.  We have been saying, warning for months, that President Putin was planning and was likely to carry out an aggression of Ukraine.  And of course, in recent weeks before the invasion began I laid out before the United Nations, the Security Council, exactly what we expected Putin to do and how he would do it – creating bogus pretexts for war, and then using those false flags and other operations as justification for invading Ukraine.  And for months we’ve made clear that this is what we expected, but at the same time it’s our obligation, my obligation, the obligation of allies and partners, to pursue diplomacy if there is any opportunity to do so because, as we said all along, it’s far preferable than what we’re seeing.</p>
<p>And again, as we said all along, there are two paths that Russia can take.  One is diplomacy and dialogue, the other is aggression against Ukraine, and we said we would be prepared either way.  And we are.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  Nomia Iqbal, BBC.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you, Secretary.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good evening.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Are you considering energy sanctions against Russia?  Because realistically, how can the West defeat Putin Ukraine when the West also pays Putin up to $700 million a day in oil, gas, and coal?  And the British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has talked about it, how Britain is looking into it.  Are you?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  First, as a general proposition, nothing is off the table, and we are evaluating every single day the sanctions, their implementation, and additional measures.  The sanctions are designed, in the first instance, of course, to have maximum impact on Russia and Putin while minimizing harm to us and our allies and partners.  There is no strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy.  The immediate effect would be to raise prices at the pump for Americans and also to pad Russian profits with rising prices.</p>
<p>So we’ve been carving out payments for energy trade and transport from the sanctions that we’ve been implementing.  But we have a strong interest – we and our allies – in degrading Russia’s status as a leading energy supplier.  Over time, this would be a profound strategic shift.  That’s why Nord Stream 2 was shut down.  That’s why we’re surging LNG to Europe right now to help accelerate its diversification away from Russian gas.  It’s why we’re denying critical technologies to Russia for further energy exploration going forward through the export controls we’ve put in place.  This is part of a process to reduce reliance, dependence on Russian energy.</p>
<p>So that’s where our focus is.  But again, as I said, we’re looking at these things every single day.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  We’ll &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Are you willing to say how long will that take?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And how many people have to die in Ukraine before &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I’m not going to put a timeframe on it.  What’s happened in record time, as we’ve seen, are sanctions and other measures that a few weeks ago people would have said were never going to happen.  I think we’ve demonstrated very, very clearly that what we said we would do many months ago when this crisis first began to emerge back in November, December – the G7 countries, the European Union, I said that if Russia chose the path of aggression, we would impose massive consequences on Russia, including unprecedented economic sanctions.  I know some people thought that that was more rhetoric than reality.  I think we’ve demonstrated already how strong that reality is, and again, we’re looking every day at measures to increase the extraordinary pressure we’re already exerting.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  We’ll take a final question from Iurii Sheiko, DW.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you very much.  Secretary, I have two questions.  First is also on no-fly zone.  You said that NATO will not send fighter jets to Ukraine to shoot down Russians.  It’s understandable, but there is another way to impose this no-fly zone, and I mean sending to Ukraine air defense capabilities.  Of course, United States send Stinger missiles, but I’m speaking about high-to-medium air defense capabilities to support the currently working Ukrainian defense capabilities with S-300 and Buk, which are working also quite well.</p>
<p>The second question is you saw – we saw more than a week of fighting and how Russian forces weren’t able to achieve most of its objectives.  They were bogged down; they were stopped in many places.  So how does this week of war change the U.S. assessment of the might of Russian military?  That was considered to be quite high, but now – what is your assessment now?  Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.  Thank you.  First part of the question, we are looking every day at what technologies, what capacities we can effectively deliver to Ukraine to defend itself, and that’s an ongoing conversation literally happening on a daily basis both with Ukraine and government officials as well as among allies and partners, and so the main focus is on making sure that anything we provide can be used, used effectively, and in a timely way.  So – but as I said, that’s quite literally something we’re looking at every day.</p>
<p>So I don’t want to draw any conclusions from the week of invasion in terms of what this tells us about Russia or its capabilities.  I think we’ll have time to fully assess that.  What we do know, what it does tell us is how extraordinary the Ukrainian people are, their will, their determination, their absolute commitment to defend their country, to defend their freedom, to defend their future.  That’s the story of the past week, and it’s an incredibly powerful one.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  Thank you very much.</p>

<p>We’ve already been engaged in a remarkable effort, just speaking for the United States, with the various drawdowns that President Biden has done.  We’ve provided, over the past year and change, more than a billion dollars in security assistance to Ukraine.  The most recent drawdown that was issued by the President of $350 million, we have already sent into Ukraine about $250 million worth of that drawdown.  So this is happening every single day, and you’re seeing the means that Ukraine needs to defend itself get into the hands of Ukrainians who are doing that.</p>
<p>Having said that, one of the things that we talked about at length today in our various meetings at NATO and the EU was what more we can do and how to do it effectively.  I would add that, I think as you know, Foreign Minister Kuleba actually came into our meetings by video; we heard from him directly some of the additional things that Ukraine is looking for.  We’re working on all of that every single day.</p>
<p>We’re also a week and change into this horrific war wrought by Russia.  We’ve had already a dramatic impact, far beyond, I think, what anyone would have expected on Russia and its economy.  The ruble is trading at its weakest levels ever.  It’s worth less than a penny.  Russian authorities are expecting exporters to sell at least 80 percent of the foreign currency that they have to prop up what is a rapidly weakening currency.  The stock market’s been closed for days due to a fear of capital flight once it opens.  This is the longest stretch of emergency closure since Russia defaulted back in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The CBR has more than doubled their key interest rate – the central bank – to 20 percent, the highest in almost 20 years.  Capital controls, et cetera.  We’re seeing – I have a list five pages long of all the businesses that have left Russia.  But this take – the impact is there.  It’s powerful, it’s real, and it is building.  So let’s see how Russia responds to that as this really takes hold and takes a grip.</p>
<p>Second, as we’ve been demonstrating by not only what we’ve been saying but what we’ve been doing, the support for Ukraine is real, profound, extensive – the security assistance that we just talked about that continues to go in, the humanitarian support that we continue to build in response to the humanitarian horror that Russia has wrought, as well as economic assistance.  Unfortunately, this is not like flipping a light switch.  It takes time.  And when you have, in the case of Russia and President Putin’s Russia a country that is prepared to go to excessive means to achieve its results, it is a real challenge.</p>
<p>But not only are we at it every day, I think what the Ukrainian people can see is virtually the entire world united in support of them, in support of their cause of independence, territorial integrity, freedom, demonstrated by the meetings we had today, demonstrated by the 141 countries that came together at the United Nations to make that clear.  So there is a huge tide of support for Ukraine.  There is a huge weight bearing down on Russia.  Let’s see what the impact is.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  Méabh McMahon, Euronews.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hi, there.  Thank you so much for this.  Méabh McMahon, Euronews.  So we heard this morning at NATO that the situation will get worse before it gets better.  So tell us:  What do you know that we don’t?  And is the no to the no-fly zone set in stone completely, or would you consider it if this conflict does become a massacre?</p>
<p>And just a follow-up, Was it naïve of you and of course the Europeans to trust in Putin to opt for diplomacy?  Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  When we say it is likely to get worse, it’s unfortunately based on everything we know about President Putin’s methods when it comes to seeking to subjugate another country to his will or another region to his will.  We saw it in Chechnya.  We’ve seen it in Syria.  We saw it, of course, in 2014 in Ukraine.  And what we’re seeing on the battlefield is Russian forces seeking to encircle the major cities, including Kyiv, and we’re seeing them use increasingly brutal methods, including going at civilians and civilian populations.</p>
<p>So I think the terrible expectation is that the suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better for as long as Russia pursues these methods.  So that is unfortunately more likely than not, although we are doing everything we can to try to move this to a different track.</p>
<p>With regard to the no-fly zone, I think you heard NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg speak to this earlier today.  One of the responsibilities we have, even as we are doing everything we can to give the Ukrainian people the means to defend themselves effectively against Russia, we also have a responsibility, as the secretary general said, to ensure that the war doesn’t spill over even beyond Ukraine.  And again, because I think he put it so well, as he noted, the only way to actually implement something like a no-fly zone is to send NATO planes into Ukrainian airspace and to shoot down Russian planes, and that could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe.</p>
<p>President Biden has been clear that we are not going to get into a war with Russia.  But we are going to tremendous lengths with allies and partners to provide the Ukrainians with the means to effectively defend themselves.  And of course we’re seeing every single day their extraordinary heroism as well as very, very real results in what they’re doing to achieve that.</p>
<p>And I’m sorry, I missed the last part of your question.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Just do you feel like – remember we spoke together last spring when you were here in Brussels at the NATO Headquarters, and I feel the question now is: Do you feel that you were naïve or the Europeans were naïve to trust in Putin that he would come to the table and he would choose diplomacy over this invasion?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, I’ll only speak for the United States.  I think we were the opposite of naïve.  We have been saying, warning for months, that President Putin was planning and was likely to carry out an aggression of Ukraine.  And of course, in recent weeks before the invasion began I laid out before the United Nations, the Security Council, exactly what we expected Putin to do and how he would do it – creating bogus pretexts for war, and then using those false flags and other operations as justification for invading Ukraine.  And for months we’ve made clear that this is what we expected, but at the same time it’s our obligation, my obligation, the obligation of allies and partners, to pursue diplomacy if there is any opportunity to do so because, as we said all along, it’s far preferable than what we’re seeing.</p>
<p>And again, as we said all along, there are two paths that Russia can take.  One is diplomacy and dialogue, the other is aggression against Ukraine, and we said we would be prepared either way.  And we are.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  Nomia Iqbal, BBC.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you, Secretary.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good evening.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Are you considering energy sanctions against Russia?  Because realistically, how can the West defeat Putin Ukraine when the West also pays Putin up to $700 million a day in oil, gas, and coal?  And the British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has talked about it, how Britain is looking into it.  Are you?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  First, as a general proposition, nothing is off the table, and we are evaluating every single day the sanctions, their implementation, and additional measures.  The sanctions are designed, in the first instance, of course, to have maximum impact on Russia and Putin while minimizing harm to us and our allies and partners.  There is no strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy.  The immediate effect would be to raise prices at the pump for Americans and also to pad Russian profits with rising prices.</p>
<p>So we’ve been carving out payments for energy trade and transport from the sanctions that we’ve been implementing.  But we have a strong interest – we and our allies – in degrading Russia’s status as a leading energy supplier.  Over time, this would be a profound strategic shift.  That’s why Nord Stream 2 was shut down.  That’s why we’re surging LNG to Europe right now to help accelerate its diversification away from Russian gas.  It’s why we’re denying critical technologies to Russia for further energy exploration going forward through the export controls we’ve put in place.  This is part of a process to reduce reliance, dependence on Russian energy.</p>
<p>So that’s where our focus is.  But again, as I said, we’re looking at these things every single day.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  We’ll &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Are you willing to say how long will that take?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And how many people have to die in Ukraine before &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I’m not going to put a timeframe on it.  What’s happened in record time, as we’ve seen, are sanctions and other measures that a few weeks ago people would have said were never going to happen.  I think we’ve demonstrated very, very clearly that what we said we would do many months ago when this crisis first began to emerge back in November, December – the G7 countries, the European Union, I said that if Russia chose the path of aggression, we would impose massive consequences on Russia, including unprecedented economic sanctions.  I know some people thought that that was more rhetoric than reality.  I think we’ve demonstrated already how strong that reality is, and again, we’re looking every day at measures to increase the extraordinary pressure we’re already exerting.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  We’ll take a final question from Iurii Sheiko, DW.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you very much.  Secretary, I have two questions.  First is also on no-fly zone.  You said that NATO will not send fighter jets to Ukraine to shoot down Russians.  It’s understandable, but there is another way to impose this no-fly zone, and I mean sending to Ukraine air defense capabilities.  Of course, United States send Stinger missiles, but I’m speaking about high-to-medium air defense capabilities to support the currently working Ukrainian defense capabilities with S-300 and Buk, which are working also quite well.</p>
<p>The second question is you saw – we saw more than a week of fighting and how Russian forces weren’t able to achieve most of its objectives.  They were bogged down; they were stopped in many places.  So how does this week of war change the U.S. assessment of the might of Russian military?  That was considered to be quite high, but now – what is your assessment now?  Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.  Thank you.  First part of the question, we are looking every day at what technologies, what capacities we can effectively deliver to Ukraine to defend itself, and that’s an ongoing conversation literally happening on a daily basis both with Ukraine and government officials as well as among allies and partners, and so the main focus is on making sure that anything we provide can be used, used effectively, and in a timely way.  So – but as I said, that’s quite literally something we’re looking at every day.</p>
<p>So I don’t want to draw any conclusions from the week of invasion in terms of what this tells us about Russia or its capabilities.  I think we’ll have time to fully assess that.  What we do know, what it does tell us is how extraordinary the Ukrainian people are, their will, their determination, their absolute commitment to defend their country, to defend their freedom, to defend their future.  That’s the story of the past week, and it’s an incredibly powerful one.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  Thank you very much.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>European Commission</p>
<p><b>PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN:  </b>So Secretary of State Blinken, dear Tony, a very warm welcome.  I’m very glad to have you again here in Berlaymont.  Your visit to Europe illustrates how very close the cooperation is between the European Union and the United States in response to Putin’s reckless invasion of Ukraine.  And thanks to this coordination, we have together designed, developed, and deployed sanctions in record time, sanctions that demonstrate our determination to make Putin pay a price for his war.</p>
<p>We do not take these measures lightly, but it is clear we need to act.  And with these measures, the central bank cannot use a significant share of its reserves to defend the ruble, now in free fall.  The central bank has had to raise interest rates by 20 percent, stoking inflation.  Significant commercial banks are cut off from global markets and from SWIFT, curtailing their ability to finance the economy.  The stock exchange in Moscow remains closed since the beginning of this week.  One after another, Western companies announced their own measures stopping production, investment, and sales.</p>
<p>The European Union and the U.S. cooperation is at the core of this effective response, and it has pulled together an ever-growing number of countries that apply identical or similar sanctions – our G7 partners, UK, Canada, and Japan, but also countries like Norway, Switzerland, South Korea, Australia, by now over 40 countries partially or completely aligned with our sanctions.  And this is testimony to the determination of the global community to reject this invasion.  One only needs to see the result of this week’s United Nations General Assembly: 141 countries, an overwhelming majority, supported the resolution condemning Russia for its brutal invasion.  Only four countries out of 193 stood by Russia.  It was Belarus, North Korea, Syria, and Eritrea.</p>
<p>President Putin is increasingly isolated in the world community, but in the face of the world’s protests, Putin’s army carries on.  Bombings and missile attacks on civilian targets are intensifying.  Rest assured the European Union and the United States will continue to stand by Ukraine and its courageous people and its steadfast leadership.</p>
<p>The scale of the humanitarian catastrophe that – in Ukraine that is unfolding really worries us.  Europe is seeing destruction and displacement on a scale not seen since the darkest days of the last century.  The European Union, as Ukraine’s neighbor, is sparing no effort.  We’re providing 500 million euros of humanitarian aid immediately, and more will come.  We’re working fast to establish civil protection hubs in Poland, in Slovakia, and in Romania.  And we are also doing everything we can with international organizations and NGOs to set up humanitarian corridors that stretch inside Ukraine.  Desperately needed humanitarian aid must be able to reach all parts of Ukraine and civilians must be allowed to escape cities under siege.</p>
<p>Finally, the European Union has triggered for the first time ever the so-called Temporary Protection Directive.  What is it?  It effectively opens up residency rights for most refugees to live and work in the European Union, to have access to health services or, for example, schools for at least a year.</p>
<p>We know that this conflict is far from over, and to be very clear, we are ready to take further severe measures if Putin does not stop and reverse the war he has unleashed.  We’re determined, we’re united, and it’s a pleasure to have you here, dear Tony.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Madam President, Ursula, thank you.  A short while ago we were meeting with the EU’s Foreign Affairs Council, and before that at NATO, and I’ll have more to say about that later.  But with us was – by video was Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister.  And in the course of speaking to us, he showed us some photographs, one of which – which I think has also been in the media – shows a father grieving over his dead child.  Blood is still on the sheet that drapes him.  It’s a reminder that even as we talk about these weighty issues of war and peace, what this is really about is the lives of men, women, children – hundreds, thousands of individual human tragedies inflicted by Vladimir Putin and his war of choice on Ukraine and its people.  And we can’t lose sight of that fact.</p>
<p>It’s also about an assault on some very basic principles that we established together after two world wars to make sure that we wouldn’t see another one, principles that are at the heart of an international system that has a responsibility to preserve peace and security among nations, principles like the notion that one country can’t simply commit acts of aggression on another, changing its borders by force; that one country can’t dictate to another its choices, its decisions, its policies, with whom it will associate; principles like one country can’t exert a sphere of influence to subjugate its neighbors to its will – each principle now under assault by the aggression against Ukraine committed by President Putin and Russia.</p>
<p>If we allow those principles to be violated with impunity, then we’re opening a Pandora’s box in every corner of the world for this to happen again and again and again, and the peace and security – with all of the deficiencies that we’ve known over the last 80 years, but nonetheless peace and security that we’ve been able to establish – that will be gone.  So the stakes here are very real.  They’re about real lives, real people, real human beings, and they are about large principles that we have to defend.</p>
<p>And we are.  And we are in no small measure because of the extraordinary work that we’ve been able to do together, the United States and the European Union.  When President Biden took office, one of the first trips he asked me to make was here to see you, to see the leaders of the European Union, because President Biden was convinced that this partnership between us was really a partnership of first choice, that looking at all of the problems that our citizens face in their daily lives, we would be so much more effective in dealing with those problems, those challenges, and those opportunities together, not alone, not individually.</p>
<p>And over the course of this year in this effort that we’ve taken together to revitalize, to re-energize the partnership between the United States and the European Union, we have done some remarkable things in so many different areas, from climate to COVID to emerging technologies.  But now, now we’re being tested in a moment of crisis, and I think that precisely because we have invested together in this partnership, we’re responding and we’re meeting the test.  As the president said, across so many different areas – the support for Ukraine, the sanctions against Russia, the help being provided to people in distress – we’re standing up together.</p>
<p>But I have to say that as someone who’s watched this over the years, both from Europe and from the United States, I am – it’s hard to find the right word for it, but let me simply say it’s been almost overwhelming to see how quickly, how effectively the European Union has come together and acted in the face of this aggression.  Things that none of us thought were possible weeks ago now are reality because this union is strong, it’s united, and it’s acting, and we’re grateful to have this partnership because it is making a difference.</p>
<p>I think we know something else, and the president alluded to it.  Unfortunately, tragically, horrifically, this may not be over soon.  And so these efforts that we’re making together, we have to sustain them, we have to build upon them.  We have to get to the point together and with, as the president said, so many other countries around the world who are united in their abhorrence of what President Putin has unleashed.  We have to sustain this until it stops, until the war is over, Russian forces leave, the Ukrainian people regain their independence, their sovereignty, their territorial integrity.  We’re committed to doing that.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN:</b>  Thank you very much.</p>

<p>We do not take these measures lightly, but it is clear we need to act.  And with these measures, the central bank cannot use a significant share of its reserves to defend the ruble, now in free fall.  The central bank has had to raise interest rates by 20 percent, stoking inflation.  Significant commercial banks are cut off from global markets and from SWIFT, curtailing their ability to finance the economy.  The stock exchange in Moscow remains closed since the beginning of this week.  One after another, Western companies announced their own measures stopping production, investment, and sales.</p>
<p>The European Union and the U.S. cooperation is at the core of this effective response, and it has pulled together an ever-growing number of countries that apply identical or similar sanctions – our G7 partners, UK, Canada, and Japan, but also countries like Norway, Switzerland, South Korea, Australia, by now over 40 countries partially or completely aligned with our sanctions.  And this is testimony to the determination of the global community to reject this invasion.  One only needs to see the result of this week’s United Nations General Assembly: 141 countries, an overwhelming majority, supported the resolution condemning Russia for its brutal invasion.  Only four countries out of 193 stood by Russia.  It was Belarus, North Korea, Syria, and Eritrea.</p>
<p>President Putin is increasingly isolated in the world community, but in the face of the world’s protests, Putin’s army carries on.  Bombings and missile attacks on civilian targets are intensifying.  Rest assured the European Union and the United States will continue to stand by Ukraine and its courageous people and its steadfast leadership.</p>
<p>The scale of the humanitarian catastrophe that – in Ukraine that is unfolding really worries us.  Europe is seeing destruction and displacement on a scale not seen since the darkest days of the last century.  The European Union, as Ukraine’s neighbor, is sparing no effort.  We’re providing 500 million euros of humanitarian aid immediately, and more will come.  We’re working fast to establish civil protection hubs in Poland, in Slovakia, and in Romania.  And we are also doing everything we can with international organizations and NGOs to set up humanitarian corridors that stretch inside Ukraine.  Desperately needed humanitarian aid must be able to reach all parts of Ukraine and civilians must be allowed to escape cities under siege.</p>
<p>Finally, the European Union has triggered for the first time ever the so-called Temporary Protection Directive.  What is it?  It effectively opens up residency rights for most refugees to live and work in the European Union, to have access to health services or, for example, schools for at least a year.</p>
<p>We know that this conflict is far from over, and to be very clear, we are ready to take further severe measures if Putin does not stop and reverse the war he has unleashed.  We’re determined, we’re united, and it’s a pleasure to have you here, dear Tony.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Madam President, Ursula, thank you.  A short while ago we were meeting with the EU’s Foreign Affairs Council, and before that at NATO, and I’ll have more to say about that later.  But with us was – by video was Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister.  And in the course of speaking to us, he showed us some photographs, one of which – which I think has also been in the media – shows a father grieving over his dead child.  Blood is still on the sheet that drapes him.  It’s a reminder that even as we talk about these weighty issues of war and peace, what this is really about is the lives of men, women, children – hundreds, thousands of individual human tragedies inflicted by Vladimir Putin and his war of choice on Ukraine and its people.  And we can’t lose sight of that fact.</p>
<p>It’s also about an assault on some very basic principles that we established together after two world wars to make sure that we wouldn’t see another one, principles that are at the heart of an international system that has a responsibility to preserve peace and security among nations, principles like the notion that one country can’t simply commit acts of aggression on another, changing its borders by force; that one country can’t dictate to another its choices, its decisions, its policies, with whom it will associate; principles like one country can’t exert a sphere of influence to subjugate its neighbors to its will – each principle now under assault by the aggression against Ukraine committed by President Putin and Russia.</p>
<p>If we allow those principles to be violated with impunity, then we’re opening a Pandora’s box in every corner of the world for this to happen again and again and again, and the peace and security – with all of the deficiencies that we’ve known over the last 80 years, but nonetheless peace and security that we’ve been able to establish – that will be gone.  So the stakes here are very real.  They’re about real lives, real people, real human beings, and they are about large principles that we have to defend.</p>
<p>And we are.  And we are in no small measure because of the extraordinary work that we’ve been able to do together, the United States and the European Union.  When President Biden took office, one of the first trips he asked me to make was here to see you, to see the leaders of the European Union, because President Biden was convinced that this partnership between us was really a partnership of first choice, that looking at all of the problems that our citizens face in their daily lives, we would be so much more effective in dealing with those problems, those challenges, and those opportunities together, not alone, not individually.</p>
<p>And over the course of this year in this effort that we’ve taken together to revitalize, to re-energize the partnership between the United States and the European Union, we have done some remarkable things in so many different areas, from climate to COVID to emerging technologies.  But now, now we’re being tested in a moment of crisis, and I think that precisely because we have invested together in this partnership, we’re responding and we’re meeting the test.  As the president said, across so many different areas – the support for Ukraine, the sanctions against Russia, the help being provided to people in distress – we’re standing up together.</p>
<p>But I have to say that as someone who’s watched this over the years, both from Europe and from the United States, I am – it’s hard to find the right word for it, but let me simply say it’s been almost overwhelming to see how quickly, how effectively the European Union has come together and acted in the face of this aggression.  Things that none of us thought were possible weeks ago now are reality because this union is strong, it’s united, and it’s acting, and we’re grateful to have this partnership because it is making a difference.</p>
<p>I think we know something else, and the president alluded to it.  Unfortunately, tragically, horrifically, this may not be over soon.  And so these efforts that we’re making together, we have to sustain them, we have to build upon them.  We have to get to the point together and with, as the president said, so many other countries around the world who are united in their abhorrence of what President Putin has unleashed.  We have to sustain this until it stops, until the war is over, Russian forces leave, the Ukrainian people regain their independence, their sovereignty, their territorial integrity.  We’re committed to doing that.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN:</b>  Thank you very much.</p>
