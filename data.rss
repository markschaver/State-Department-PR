<p>The below is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman spoke with Republic of Korea (ROK) First Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong Kun and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Mori Takeo today to discuss shared concerns about the DPRK’s WMD and ballistic missile programs.  They also discussed the importance of unified action to hold Russia accountable for Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary Sherman strongly condemned the DPRK’s recent ballistic missile launches, which brazenly violated multiple UN Security Council resolutions and were a serious escalation by the DPRK.  She underscored the ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of our allies, the ROK and Japan.  The Deputy Secretary reaffirmed U.S. commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and continued efforts to seek diplomacy with the DPRK.</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary Sherman, Vice Foreign Minister Mori, and Vice Foreign Minister Choi also discussed international efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked, unjustified, and unconscionable war against Ukraine.  The Deputy Secretary and Vice Foreign Ministers also spoke about our shared efforts, including from the private sector, to support the people of Ukraine.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today, the United States and the Philippines signed a Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Strategic Civil Nuclear Cooperation (NCMOU), which improves our cooperation on energy security and strengthens our diplomatic and economic relationship. Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie Jenkins signed for the United States, and Mr. Gerardo Erguiza Jr., Undersecretary of Energy, signed for the Philippines.</p>
<p>The United States and the Philippines have an enduring alliance and maintain long-standing cooperation in the fields of security, energy, commerce, and nonproliferation.  Deepening our cooperation in nuclear energy, science and technology has the potential to make a significant contribution to our shared clean energy goals, agricultural development, availability of clean water, medical treatments, and more.  Our nuclear cooperation rests on a strong nonproliferation regime and the Philippines’ steadfast commitment to nonproliferation.</p>
<p>Nuclear Cooperation MOUs are diplomatic mechanisms that strengthen and expand strategic ties between the United States and a partner country by providing a framework for cooperation and a mutually aligned approach to nonproliferation on civil nuclear issues and for engagement between experts from government, industry, national laboratories, and academic institutions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Wendy R. Sherman, Deputy Secretary of State</p>
<p>Algiers, Algeria</p>
<p>Good afternoon. It is wonderful to back in Algiers for my first visit as Deputy Secretary of State. And I’m so delighted to be standing here with your Foreign Minister  and our Ambassador .</p>
<p>I want to sincerely thank President Tebboune for his hospitality and warm welcome. We just concluded a very productive meeting.</p>
<p>The President shared with me his plans to create more jobs and diversify Algeria’s economy into strategic sectors, including agribusiness, information communications technology, and clean energy.</p>
<p>These are areas where U.S. businesses can work closely with Algeria. For instance, just last week a delegation of U.S. small businesses in wind energy, wastewater treatment, and oil services visited Algeria.</p>
<p>The United States and Algeria both want to increase trade and economic cooperation with each other. We are thrilled and honored that the President plans to visit the U.S. pavilion during the Algiers International Fair this June, where the United States will be the country of honor.</p>
<p>We also discussed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s—in my words—premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war of choice against Ukraine, and how President Putin’s actions violate the principles of the UN Charter.</p>
<p>Our meeting also covered some important regional issues, and I look forward to continuing the discussion I also had with the Foreign Minister earlier today.</p>
<p>The United States and Algeria agree that regional stability is key to a peaceful and prosperous future for the entire Sahel.  Both of our countries are concerned about the destabilizing presence of foreign forces and are working together to counter violent extremist groups.</p>
<p>I also reaffirmed the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to human rights, including media freedom and religious freedom.</p>
<p>The United States’ relationship with Algeria is broad and deep, and we look forward to continuing to further deepen our cooperation on jobs and economic development, clean energy, security, and other areas.</p>
<p>Once again, I was honored by my time with your President, and for his gracious—and for the Foreign Minister’s gracious—hospitality today. We are thrilled that we have sent you one of our very best to be Ambassador here, and I know she will carry on the conversations we started today to further deepen our relationship.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.<input type="hidden" data-filter="111111110011" /></p>
