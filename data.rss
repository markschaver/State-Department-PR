					<description><![CDATA[<p>Rachel Arndt, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Passport Services Bureau of Consular Affairs</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER:</b> Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the State Department’s press briefing on the status of our passport services. Joining us today is Deputy Assistant Secretary for Passport Services Rachel Arndt from the department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs. Deputy Assistant Secretary Arndt oversees and directs the department’s passports operations here in Washington, as well as its network of passport agencies and centers across the United States.</p>
<p>Today’s briefing is on the record; however, the contents will be embargoed until the end of the call. Deputy Assistant Secretary Arndt will begin with a brief opening statement, and then we’ll take your questions. With that, I’ll hand it over to you, DAS Arndt.</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT:</b> Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. As noted, I’m here to talk to you about the status of the State Department’s passport services. We as a department continue to recover from the effects of COVID-19 while we work to meet passport demand as U.S. citizens increasingly seek to travel overseas again. The success of the U.S. Government’s COVID-19 vaccination program means Americans will be able to get back to normal in many ways this summer. However, the pandemic’s disruptions continue to have a ripple effect on all steps of the passport process, including the amount of time it currently takes us to process a passport application.</p>
<p>We are surging staff, both adjudicators and contractors, back into the office at agencies across the country as COVID restrictions ease. But it will take time for our wait times to fall from the current 12 to 18 weeks to pre-pandemic levels. This means people who submit new passport applications right now will not get their new passport until well into the fall. Last-minute passport appointments are extremely limited. U.S. citizens who wish to travel overseas this summer and do not currently have a passport may need to make alternate travel plans.</p>
<p>We also want to remind U.S. citizens many parts of the world are experiencing additional waves of COVID-19, and they may have their travel plans unexpectedly interrupted due to the health situation in their destination. We’ve been doing and continue to do everything we can to serve the American public while prioritizing the health and safety of our staff and of our customers.</p>
<p>As we bring more staff back into the office, we will continue to be as transparent as possible in updating the American public on how long it will take to get a passport.</p>
<p>With that, I will take your questions. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b> Once again, for questions press 1-0, please. You will hear acknowledgment that you’ve been placed in queue. Just listen for your name on the line.</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER:</b> Let’s go to Christina Ruffini.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, good morning. I’m wondering, you said you’re surging staff back into the office, and contractors. When you say that, is that pre-pandemic levels? Are you seeking to add more staff in order to deal with the backlog? And what is the process for someone who needs an emergency passport or absolutely has to travel? Is there any way to expedite, and what are the odds of that happening? Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT:</b> Thank you, yes. We are ramping up our staffing, as noted. This summer we’re going to have over 150 staff returning to 21 agencies across the country, and that will increase our capacity to process applications more quickly. We are looking at surging back to pre-pandemic staffing levels and additional staff for both government and contractor staff.</p>
<p>The – as far as the second part of your question, for getting service right now, you can go online and make – get the application form for your passport and submit it by mail, if you’re eligible. And if you have to travel urgently and still need the passport, we do have extremely limited appointments for customers who have urgent international travel in the next 72 hours, or three business days, for reasons other than life-and-death emergencies. So that, you would need to go online to our online appointment system to make an appointment, and that appointment would have to be within three business days of the international travel. One caveat is if you need a foreign visa for your travel, the date of your appointment can be within 10 business days of your international travel.</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER: </b>Let’s go to Nick Wadhams.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>Hi. Sorry. Sorry, can you hear me?</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER: </b>Yes, we can hear you.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>Okay, thanks. Sorry, I missed it just at the beginning. You said the wait times will be 12 to 18 weeks? And then also, can you address the issue of staff who are working on visas for foreigners looking to come into the United States? Do you have any sense of when the travel restrictions or the – for foreigners from Schengen countries and other nations like India and Brazil will be lifted? Thanks.</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT: </b>Let me address the second part of your question by saying that visa services are certainly outside of my swim lane. However, I will say that COVID-19 has been a disruptive force across the globe, and I know that many of our operations are impacted by that.</p>
<p>As far as – to go back to the routine passport processing times, currently our wait time for both new and renewal routine passport applications can be up to 18 weeks, and that includes our processing time, the initial internal intake of the applications, and mailing. Customers can pay an additional $60 to expedite their applications, and the wait times for the expedited applications are currently up to 12 weeks, and again, depending on the mailing time. We really encourage folks to apply for or renew their passport at least six months ahead of when you’ll need one to avoid any of those last-minute problems.</p>
<p>I would also note that when checking your expiration date, folks should also check the dates of their children’s passports as those are valid for only five years instead of the adults’, which are 10 years, and we find that people run into some difficulties if they don’t check their children’s passports. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER: </b>Let’s go to Courtney McBride.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>Thank you. We’ve heard from some travelers who have been unable to even get through on the renewal lines or the passport agency phone lines. They’ve cited long hold times followed by disconnections, and I’m wondering if your staffing surge also improves – includes improvements to those systems.</p>
<p>And then separately, the chairman and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee wrote to Secretary Blinken urging acceleration of processing and asking how Congress could potentially assist with resources or other steps, and I’m just wondering whether the department intends to respond by their Friday deadline. Thanks.</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT: </b>Yes, thank you. I am certain that we have received that letter and will respond promptly. As to the call center, we note that the majority of the callers are actually requesting information on the status of their pending applications, which you can find that online at <a href="http://passportstatus.state.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://passportstatus.state.gov&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626368951320000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqMdqSkcFodUv99qVA7qnruZvyMg">passportstatus.state.gov</a>. Representatives will not be able to provide the status updates by phone as they’re prioritizing life-or-death emergency appointments and expedite service upgrades. So it may take weeks for that status to be available as we are processing and intaking applications.</p>
<p>The passport information center, or our call center, is experiencing just unprecedented call volumes for many of the same reasons that our wait times are increasing. So we are addressing this by bringing on more staff to answer calls, as local conditions permit, and then working with our contractor for the call center to increase their staffing levels, and they are doing this with some aggressive hiring also, so also trying to surge on the call center staffing. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER: </b>Let’s go to Lara Jakes.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b>Hi, thanks for doing the call. Obviously, you know there’s huge interest in this issue. Two questions. One, what is the backlog, the current backlog of passports right now? I know you’ve mentioned the wait time, but how does that equate into actual applications that are sitting and waiting? And then secondly, I was curious. You mentioned that parents should also be looking at their children’s passports since they expire within a five-year period as opposed to a 10-year period. But as you know, children are required when they reapply to do it in-person – both parents need to be there. Quite an onerous process as opposed to just mailing it in, which is what you&#8217;re recommending for adults to do. Has there been any consideration of waiving those in-person requirements or those two-parent requirements for children to allow them to renew their passports online as well? Thanks.</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT: </b>Thank you. Yes, our backlog currently is somewhere in the range of a million and a half to 2 million applications. That is somewhat higher than what we would normally expect to see. However, that was really because as the travelers were ramping up with the vaccinations availability, the workload started coming in faster than we had – we would normally see. And you&#8217;re correct that we do require for the children’s passports to – and all first-time applicants actually must apply in person. And when we say “apply in person,” we can use a passport acceptance facility such as the post office, clerks of court, libraries, local government offices, and we do have information on <a href="http://travel.state.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://travel.state.gov&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626368951320000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGlCcSLQBfTgkRbazLCA_7nt49l8A">travel.state.gov</a> where people can locate the nearest location for that. And many of those facilities are also ramping back up their appointment availabilities similar to what we are doing. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b> Let’s go to Conor Finnegan.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Hey, thanks for doing this. Can you say how many, if any, of the regional passport offices are fully reopened? And if some of them are in cities that are fully reopened otherwise in accordance with their local restrictions, why aren’t these offices now fully reopened and fully restaffed so that they can take more appointments, more walk-in appointments, more emergency appointments? Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT:</b> Yes, as of July 12th, we had passport agencies where staff was returning, all of the staff was returning in 16 – I’m sorry, 17 cities. We have an additional five that we are anticipating approval to move to be completely open with all staff back in the office. What we are doing with the limited appointments, and those are available, again, on a first-come, first-served basis, is we are trying to address all of our workflow streams, and that means we have the majority of our work comes in through the mail. It takes four to five times longer to assist a customer at a counter than in the back room looking at the documentation, so what we’re doing to ensure that we get through all of the applications as quickly as possible is to continue to focus on those that are pending that people have applied for in the past several months. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b> Let’s go to Eric Katz.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. I wanted to ask, first of all, how important is it to have workers in person? There’s in-person application process that you’ve gone over, but to what extent can sort of normal passport processing happen when the staff is working remotely? And secondly, when you talked about surging up offices, is there any actual new hiring taking place, or is this just returning employees who had been remote back to the office and adding contractors? I – just to add on to that – sorry – I know there was this – the department told the IG in 2019 that there was a critical shortage of passport specialists, so has that been addressed, and are you trying to add on to the that? Are you still trying to get back to sort of the normal level?</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT:</b> Yes. So our – actually, passport specialists need to be physically present in the office to process the passports. They are not processing remotely or from home. What we have for our issuance process, we require a connectivity to systems and databases that are currently only accessible from within our facilities. So we’re trying to adjudicate on site to help us safeguard the customers’ personally identifiable information and to ensure the integrity of the entire application process. So we’re maintaining very high standards of security and privacy protection for the customers, and we’re securing their sensitive documents like their birth certificates and naturalization certificates in our offices. And, of course, the physical printing and mailing of the passport books and cards occurs from our facility.</p>
<p>As to the hiring, we are doing dual-track, as you noted, bringing back additional folks who had been out of the office and we are also ramping up and surging to meet the higher demand levels. It does take some time to hire staff, but we – in the interim, we have – in addition to surging our staff for both contract and government, we are expanding our overtime work at all locations and we are continuing to increase the number of appointments available at all of our public passport agencies and centers. And then we are also working with our partners to expand staffing capacity at the front end for processing at our lockbox facilities where they open the mail and enter – data enter the information into the system so it’s accessible to us. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER:</b> Let’s go to Michel Ghandour, please.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you for doing the call. What about the U.S. citizens who are abroad and they need to renew their passports? Do they have to wait between 12 and 18 weeks too?</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT:</b> Yes, our embassies and consulates are currently providing emergency passport services and in some cases routine passport services to U.S. citizens overseas. That is dependent upon the particular location. So anyone who needs passport services abroad, the U.S. citizen should contact the U.S. embassy or consulate that’s closest to them, and they can find information on the services and the operations available on each of the embassies’ or consulates’ webpage. And – that information is updated weekly. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER:</b> Let’s take our last question from Ted Daniel, please.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, good morning. Is State aware that people are selling passport appointments online and is anything being done to stop that?</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT:</b> Yes, we are aware of the issues and we are working to prevent them. The Department of State does not charge a fee to solely book an emergency appointment at one of our agencies or centers, so if anyone receives a request for payment for scheduling a U.S. passport appointment, that should be considered fraudulent. You can go online and see the full schedule of passport fees, again, on <a href="http://travel.state.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://travel.state.gov&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626368951320000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGlCcSLQBfTgkRbazLCA_7nt49l8A">travel.state.gov</a> if anyone is interested in that.</p>
<p>And I’d also like to say that the department is not affiliated with any third-party appointment booking services, and we’ve seen numerous instances of falsified appointment bookings through these vendors. And unfortunately, we may not be able to honor appointments booked via third party, so we are aware and are working to try to rectify that situation. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER:</b> It looks like we have Courtney McBride of <i>Wall Street Journal</i> back in the queue. Courtney, if you’re with us, we’ll actually take you as the last question.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you so much. The department has attributed some of these extended turnaround times not just to staffing but to delays with the postal service, and for its part, USPS expressed some surprise when we talked to them about this estimate of six weeks’ mailing time between the consumer and the processing facilities. I’m just wondering if you can explain how you arrived at that number and where the discrepancy might lie.</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT:</b> Thank you. Yes, we have – that part of the process is not something, obviously, that we can control. So what we are relying on that is the – some anecdotal evidence from when passport applicants have identified that they have submitted their application and when it is received at our processing or intake processing facility. And it’s only when it’s received at our processing facility that we can actually track it and then only when it’s data entered that we will be able to provide a status update to the applicant on their passport.</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER:</b> Thank you all for joining this morning’s press briefing. That concludes the contents of the briefing. The embargo is now lifted. Have a wonderful rest of your day.</p>

What we have for our issuance process, we require a connectivity to systems and databases that are currently only accessible from within our facilities. So we’re trying to adjudicate on site to help us safeguard the customers’ personally identifiable information and to ensure the integrity of the entire application process. So we’re maintaining very high standards of security and privacy protection for the customers, and we’re securing their sensitive documents like their birth certificates and naturalization certificates in our offices. And, of course, the physical printing and mailing of the passport books and cards occurs from our facility.</p>
<p>As to the hiring, we are doing dual-track, as you noted, bringing back additional folks who had been out of the office and we are also ramping up and surging to meet the higher demand levels. It does take some time to hire staff, but we – in the interim, we have – in addition to surging our staff for both contract and government, we are expanding our overtime work at all locations and we are continuing to increase the number of appointments available at all of our public passport agencies and centers. And then we are also working with our partners to expand staffing capacity at the front end for processing at our lockbox facilities where they open the mail and enter – data enter the information into the system so it’s accessible to us. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER:</b> Let’s go to Michel Ghandour, please.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you for doing the call. What about the U.S. citizens who are abroad and they need to renew their passports? Do they have to wait between 12 and 18 weeks too?</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT:</b> Yes, our embassies and consulates are currently providing emergency passport services and in some cases routine passport services to U.S. citizens overseas. That is dependent upon the particular location. So anyone who needs passport services abroad, the U.S. citizen should contact the U.S. embassy or consulate that’s closest to them, and they can find information on the services and the operations available on each of the embassies’ or consulates’ webpage. And – that information is updated weekly. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER:</b> Let’s take our last question from Ted Daniel, please.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Hi, good morning. Is State aware that people are selling passport appointments online and is anything being done to stop that?</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT:</b> Yes, we are aware of the issues and we are working to prevent them. The Department of State does not charge a fee to solely book an emergency appointment at one of our agencies or centers, so if anyone receives a request for payment for scheduling a U.S. passport appointment, that should be considered fraudulent. You can go online and see the full schedule of passport fees, again, on <a href="http://travel.state.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://travel.state.gov&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626368951320000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGlCcSLQBfTgkRbazLCA_7nt49l8A">travel.state.gov</a> if anyone is interested in that.</p>
<p>And I’d also like to say that the department is not affiliated with any third-party appointment booking services, and we’ve seen numerous instances of falsified appointment bookings through these vendors. And unfortunately, we may not be able to honor appointments booked via third party, so we are aware and are working to try to rectify that situation. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER:</b> It looks like we have Courtney McBride of <i>Wall Street Journal</i> back in the queue. Courtney, if you’re with us, we’ll actually take you as the last question.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you so much. The department has attributed some of these extended turnaround times not just to staffing but to delays with the postal service, and for its part, USPS expressed some surprise when we talked to them about this estimate of six weeks’ mailing time between the consumer and the processing facilities. I’m just wondering if you can explain how you arrived at that number and where the discrepancy might lie.</p>
<p><b>MS ARNDT:</b> Thank you. Yes, we have – that part of the process is not something, obviously, that we can control. So what we are relying on that is the – some anecdotal evidence from when passport applicants have identified that they have submitted their application and when it is received at our processing or intake processing facility. And it’s only when it’s received at our processing facility that we can actually track it and then only when it’s data entered that we will be able to provide a status update to the applicant on their passport.</p>
<p><b>MS PORTER:</b> Thank you all for joining this morning’s press briefing. That concludes the contents of the briefing. The embargo is now lifted. Have a wonderful rest of your day.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>This Administration is deeply dedicated to addressing racial injustice and inequities at home and abroad. On the global stage, the United States is leading by example.</p>
<p>Last month, the UN’s High Commissioner for Human Rights released a report on racism and police brutality against Africans and people of African descent at the hands of law enforcement around the world, which includes examination of such cases in the United States. As the President has repeatedly made clear, great nations such as ours do not hide from our shortcomings; they acknowledge them openly and strive to improve with transparency. In so doing, we not only work to set the standard for national responses to these challenges, we also strengthen our democracy, and give new hope and motivation to human rights defenders across the globe.</p>
<p>It is in this context that the United States intends to issue a formal, standing invitation to all UN experts who report and advise on thematic human rights issues. As a first step, we have reached out to offer an official visit by the UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism and the UN Special Rapporteur on minority issues. I also welcome the UN Human Rights Council’s adoption today in Geneva of a resolution to address systemic racism against Africans and people of African descent in the context of law enforcement. I look forward to engaging with the new mechanism to advance racial justice and equity.</p>
<p>Responsible nations must not shrink from scrutiny of their human rights record; rather, they should acknowledge it with the intent to improve. I urge all UN member states to join the United States in this effort, and confront the scourge of racism, racial discrimination, and xenophobia. Because when all people – regardless of their race or ethnicity – are free to live up to their full potential, our collective security is strengthened.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, DC</p>
<p>Mayflower Hotel</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.  Thank you all very, very much.  It is actually wonderful to be in a room with real people – (laughter) – with friends, with colleagues and without masks too.  So in and of itself, that’s a very positive thing.</p>
<p>But there is a lot to be positive about today, and it starts with the remarkable work of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, especially the work of my friend Eric Schmidt, another friend and close colleague Bob Work, who I haven’t seen yet but hopefully is here, and – Bob, there you are – and the executive director Ylli Bajraktari.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for this remarkable effort.  I am in your debt, and quite frankly the country is going to be in your debt for the work that you’ve done.  I’m going to put this down.</p>
<p>And I really want to thank the members of Congress who have come together across party lines to launch this enterprise at what is a pivotal moment for our country, and I think for the world at large.</p>
<p>Today, you’ve heard from the Secretary of Defense, you’ve heard from the Secretary of Commerce, the National Security Advisor, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p>
<p>In and of itself, that is testament to how seriously the administration takes these issues.  And again, that’s in no small part due to the work of this commission.</p>
<p>You have helped clarify the links among AI, the broader set of emerging technologies, strategic competition, and our national security and prosperity.</p>
<p>And you have made crystal clear that our country needs to play catch-up and to do it fast.  And not just our country.  Countries around the world.  And I’ll come to that.</p>
<p>We’re moving quickly, because we want to ensure that as AI and related technologies transform how we live, how we work, how we compete, how we defend ourselves, that we’re staying ahead of change, indeed that we are shaping change and, critically, making sure it delivers for our people.</p>
<p>My colleagues, I think, have very capably covered the administration’s work on these issues as it relates to our domestic renewal, our economy, and our defense.</p>
<p>So what I’d like to do today is to focus on the State Department’s distinct role, because diplomacy will be critical.</p>
<p>Working with partners and allies to develop and deploy technology is going to help us tackle the most urgent challenges we face, from pandemics to the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Diplomacy will also be essential to mitigating risks, from preventing cyber attacks that target our businesses, to regulating technology that threatens our privacy, to defending our democratic values and way of life.</p>
<p>And let me just pause for a second on that last point, because I think it deserves emphasis.  It’s fundamentally what’s at stake here.</p>
<p>More than anything else, our task is to put forth and carry out a compelling vision for how to use technology in a way that serves our people, protects our interests and upholds our democratic values.  It’s not enough to highlight the horrors of techno-authoritarianism, to point to what countries like China and Russia are doing, and say that it’s wrong and dangerous, even as it is.  We’ve also got to make the positive case for our own approach, and then we’ve got to deliver.  That is the challenge before us.</p>
<p>We need the United States and we need its partners to remain the world’s innovative leaders and standard setters, to ensure that universal rights and democratic values remain at the center of all the innovation that’s to come, and that it delivers real benefits in people’s lives.  That fundamentally is the test that we have to pass, and it’s a test I think you’ve heard President Biden allude to.</p>
<p>In short, democracies have to pass the tech test together.  And diplomacy, I believe, has a big role to play in that.</p>
<p>Now, any time you hear someone from the State Department talking, we’re likely to throw in pillars and frameworks and tranches, so I can’t be any different today.  We have to have our pillars, so let me walk you through six of them – (laughter) – that cover the approach to these issues.  I know you’d be disappointed without it.</p>
<p>The first is reducing the national security risks posed by malicious cyber activities and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>This is the most basic thing our diplomacy has to do: protect our people, protect our networks, prevent conflict, and establish standards of responsible conduct in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Already, we’ve brought countries together around an approach that recognizes international law to make it clear that countries are governed in cyberspace just like they are offline and that defines norms that apply not only in wartime but in peacetime too, because we’re now dealing with significant cyber incidents outside the context of war.</p>
<p>We’ve also called for practical confidence-building measures; for example, steps as simple as establishing points of contact, so that in the event of a major cyber incident we actually know who to call.  Under American leadership, UN member-states have come together repeatedly to reaffirm this basic framework.</p>
<p>Now we’re working to bring allies and partners along to respond collectively when others engage in malicious cyber activity.  That’s what happened after the SolarWinds intrusion.  We attributed it to Russia; 22 countries, the European Union, NATO quickly supported that conclusion.  And that’s important, because when we speak with one voice, we can more effectively deter future bad acts.</p>
<p>Last month, as some of you will have noted, at the NATO summit, NATO reaffirmed that a cyber attack could trigger Article V – “an attack on one is an attack on all” – and that’s an important step too in deterring those attacks and protecting our national security in the cyber age.</p>
<p>We’re also treating ransomware not only as a law enforcement issue but also as a national security issue.  Ransomware and other cyber crimes affect all of us – our businesses, local governments; our most critical infrastructure, from power grids to hospitals.  As you know, one in four Americans has been the victim of a cyber crime, at a cost of more than $4 billion every single year.  That’s a direct threat to the safety, to the well-being of our people, and so it’s at the top of our diplomatic agenda.</p>
<p>And it’s also why we’re elevating ransomware in our engagements with Russia.  Our message is clear:  Countries that harbor cyber criminals have a responsibility to take action.  If they don’t, we will.  We’re strengthening our diplomatic and foreign assistance tools to fight transnational cyber criminals, and we’re working to expand membership in the global cyber crime treaty known as the Budapest Convention.</p>
<p>We’ll launch similar efforts on AI and other emerging technologies.  If they’re going to be used as part of our national defense, we want the world to have a shared understanding of how to do that responsibly, in the same way that we’ve hammered out rules for how to use conventional and nuclear weapons.  That’s how we reduce the risk of proliferation.  It’s how we prevent escalation or unintended incidents.</p>
<p>The second pillar is ensuring that our leadership in the fierce strategic technology competition that’s now underway not only continues but grows and strengthens.</p>
<p>We know China is determined to become the world’s technology leader.  And they have a well-resourced and comprehensive plan to achieve those ambitions.</p>
<p>We must preserve our competitive and comparative advantages.</p>
<p>That means building resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains for critical technologies.  Our proposed investments in semiconductor manufacturing here at home is an important part of that.  And again, I really want to underscore the very important work that was done on a bipartisan basis in Congress to help allow us to do that.</p>
<p>But I think you know this too:  We can’t onshore everything.  We don’t need to.  We’ll work with partners to “friend-shore” and “near-shore” our supply chains, and that will make all of us more resilient.</p>
<p>We’ll protect information communications technologies.  The Biden-Harris administration is committed to 5G security.  And we’re promoting the use of trusted and diverse vendors, including American companies, and advocating in multilateral settings for high standards for security and for trust.</p>
<p>We’re taking a fresh look at tools like export controls, investment screening, visa screening, to make sure our strategic competitors are not exploiting our own innovative ecosystems to gain military or national security advantage.</p>
<p>Today we also know that it’s harder to ensure that American innovations are used for commercial purposes only.  Countries like China don’t differentiate between civilian and military in the same way, and emerging technologies, including AI applications, blur that line too.  So we’ve got to think differently about how to protect our innovation and industries against that kind of misuse.</p>
<p>And of course, we need to do this at the same time that we’re growing our talent pipelines.  Perhaps more than any other factor, having the right people will determine whether we win the competition for the future.  We’ve got to recruit, we’ve got to retain the top talent, including talent from around the world, so that the best and the brightest study here, stay here, feel welcome here.</p>
<p>The third pillar: defending an open, secure, reliable, and interoperable internet.</p>
<p>We’ve been fighting for this vision of the internet for a long, long time.  Many of you in this room have been engaged in that effort.  These principles created the conditions that allowed the internet to grow into the transformative force that it’s become: an extraordinary resource for learning, for connection, for economic growth.</p>
<p>But the hard truth is that the internet is also growing more closed, more insecure, more fractured every single day.</p>
<p>We see country after country putting up firewalls, controlling speech, targeting activists, shutting down the internet to squelch dissent.  And while authoritarian regimes deny access to their networks, they actively reach into others and into ours, taking advantage and meddling in more open societies.  It’s no wonder that some countries are asking whether the principles around which we’ve organized the internet are still relevant, are still tenable.</p>
<p>In many ways, we are at an inflection point, some would say even a tipping point.  And our choice is between giving up on our vision for the internet or stepping up the fight.  We will step up the fight.</p>
<p>We’ll defend the principles of an open, secure, reliable, and interoperable internet across the full spectrum of our engagement – from trade agreements to governance to hardware.  We’ll use our diplomacy to unite governments and the private sector more firmly behind these efforts.  The work we do today will determine what the internet looks like just a few years from now.  That’s a responsibility we take very, very seriously.</p>
<p>The fourth pillar I want to talk about is setting technical standards and creating norms for emerging technologies.</p>
<p>Technical standards help ensure quality, protect consumer health and safety, facilitate global interoperability.  They also help overcome trade barriers and expand market access.</p>
<p>We believe in a transparent, consensus-based, and private sector-led approach to developing standards for emerging technologies.  That’s how we’ll arrive at standards that are technologically sound, have earned people’s trust, reflect our values, and help American companies compete on a level playing field.</p>
<p>And norms, of course, are standards of another kind.  We’ll work with partners to ensure that technologies are developed and deployed in ethical ways that respect people’s rights.</p>
<p>That’s what we did at the UN International Telecommunications Union just a few months ago.  Some countries proposed norms that would allow the use, for example, of facial recognition technology in ways that could threaten human rights.  We brought governments and businesses together to stop it.</p>
<p>Whenever rules and norms that affect American lives are being debated and decided, American diplomats won’t be just – won’t just be in the room; we will be leading the charge.</p>
<p>The fifth pillar is this:  It’s making technology work for democracy.</p>
<p>Some of the leading threats to democracies today are playing out, as you all know, in cyberspace. We have to be leading the world’s efforts, and particularly the world’s democracies, in responding to those threats – fighting back against disinformation, standing up for internet freedom, reducing the misuse of surveillance technology.</p>
<p>We’ve got to make sure that our companies are not inadvertently fueling authoritarian practices, whether it’s in China or anywhere else.</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve released “surveillance due diligence guidance” to try to help American companies prevent their products from being misused.</p>
<p>Technology is also disrupting democracies from within – challenging the ways we think about privacy, free speech, the power of government, and corporations.  President Biden will take on these issues here at home.  For example, his new executive order on promoting competition in the U.S. economy asks the FTC to establish rules for companies on surveillance and how to treat personal data.</p>
<p>But democracies have to work together on these issues as well.  We need to close the gaps in regulatory and legal frameworks so that democracies can collaborate more easily on issues like privacy, content moderation, data sharing, and on digital trade.</p>
<p>You all know very well these are incredibly complicated issues.  The world’s democracies are not all on the same page on every single one of them.  But at heart we do share the same principles, and I have confidence that we can work together through the differences that we have.  I can tell you this:  It is a diplomatic priority for the United States to do that.</p>
<p>So is advancing trustworthy AI.  We need be able to reassure our citizens that AI is secure, that it does not have bias embedded in it, that it can be used safely.  And here, we’re grateful for a lot of good work happening in some critical organizations, including at the OECD and the Global Partnership on AI.  This is very important, too.</p>
<p>We’re interested in increasing access to shared public data sets for AI training and testing, while still preserving privacy – especially in sectors like health, climate, and energy, where AI could create transformational breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Finally, the sixth pillar is promoting cooperation.</p>
<p>Yes, our work in this space is about protecting ourselves and our allies from threats.  And yes, it’s about competition.  But more than anything, we want and we need to bring a spirit of cooperation to tech diplomacy.  Because the bottom-line truth is this:  The United States cannot deliver on these pillars on our own.  We need partners.</p>
<p>And this may be in some ways, I think, the most fundamental imperative of our time.  And it, of course, extends beyond technology.  If you think about virtually any challenge that we have to face as a country, as a society, challenges that have a direct impact on the lives of our citizens, whether it’s dealing with this pandemic, whether it’s climate change, whether it is emerging technologies, we know that not a single one can be fully and effectively addressed by any one country acting alone, even the United States.  Now, more than ever before in my lifetime, there is an imperative for cooperation.</p>
<p>So we are building technology into nearly all of our diplomatic engagements – tech by tech, issue by issue, bilaterally, multilaterally, always looking to assemble the right configurations of allies and partners to get things done.</p>
<p>And as we see it, this agenda has to start with our democratic partners.</p>
<p>And I think we’ve already gotten some good work under our belts.  We’ve been developing shared principles at the G7.  I think you saw some of that emerge just a few weeks ago with President Biden.  We’ve created a new U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council that’s going to be an important vehicle for advancing this agenda.  We’re starting a new science and technology partnership with the UK.  We’re launching cooperative agreements with Korea and Japan on emerging technologies.  We created a Critical and Emerging Tech Working Group with the Quad countries – with Japan, Australia, India.  We’re working with G7 partners through Build Back Better World to mobilize private capital and government finance to build digital infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>Our goal is strong networks – plural – of countries, companies, universities connected by shared values and a shared commitment to design and deploy technology for the benefit of all people, to strengthen open and interoperable systems, to encourage freedom of thought and expression, which are the heart of innovation, to defend each other against those who are intent on taking technologies that could be used for good and using them for harm.</p>
<p>To deliver on all of this, we need a State Department and a diplomatic corps that treats cyber and technology like the central issues that they are.</p>
<p>I’ve asked the two deputy secretaries of state, Wendy Sherman and Brian McKeon, to take the lead on delivering recommendations for how to elevate and institutionalize cyber and tech diplomacy across the department.  And I am committed to driving this forward in full partnership with Congress.</p>
<p>We’ll make sure the State Department is organized for the task at hand because the issues before us really bear little relationship to borders on a map or the current organizational chart of the State Department.</p>
<p>We’ll build more expertise among our workforce in science, in technology, in innovation.  And here’s a request:  Help us spread the word.  We’re looking for outstanding people, for talent who want to make the leap to government, spend some time in government.  Now is a great time to put those skills to use, leveraging tech for the good of our country and for the good of the world.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, the State Department will be releasing our first ever data strategy to help us use data more effectively and more creatively for diplomacy.  If Netflix can predict what TV show my wife and I might choose to watch next, I think data can also help us and help the department predict maybe the next civil conflict, the next famine, the next economic crisis, and how we can respond more effectively.</p>
<p>I intend to leave my successor at the State Department with strong capabilities in cyber and tech diplomacy, with clear leadership, lines of authority, organizational homes, and talent at every level.  We need to become much better at anticipating the foreign policy implications of the next wave of innovation, and the wave after that.  I want to shape the strategic tech landscape, not just react to it.</p>
<p>And at the same time, we have to find ways to put tech and innovation to the task of solving the concrete problems that we’re facing, whether that’s verifying an arms control agreement or preventing the next pandemic.  I’ve been in and out of government for the better part of 25 years, and the last time I was serving with Bob and others, we’d be in that Situation Room in the White House looking at one of the many challenges that would somehow wind up in our inbox, and I think it became clearer and clearer to all of us that for virtually every single one, there was some technological component to the solution.  Part of the problem is that many of us who are engaged in these issues are not brought up on these disciplines.  Bob is an exception to that, but many of us come from the humanities, from law.  It’s not our first knowledge.  It’s not our first instinct.</p>
<p>And I got to the point when I had the responsibility of chairing some of these meetings to thinking that I needed scientists and technologists in the room just to tell me whether I needed scientists and technologists in the room – (laughter) – to help identify the problems and help identify some of the solutions.  And I became more and more convinced that virtually everything on our agenda has some tech or science or innovative component to the solution.  So we need to do a better job bringing that knowledge, that expertise, that focus into the department and to everything we do.</p>
<p>We started to do that a few years ago when I was last here.  We actually set up our first-ever office in Silicon Valley.  Some of the other agencies of government were ahead of us.  We developed partnerships with leading institutions.  One of my very strong and positive memories was spending some time out at Stanford, we had started working with a class called Hacking for Diplomacy where 20 bureaus of the State Department sent this class problems that we were trying to solve.  And these remarkable students over the course of a semester or even a year worked to solve them.  And bringing that approach, bringing that perspective brought forward answers that I don’t think we would have come to doing it on our own in Washington.  So we need to make this shift too, and the changes we’re making at State I think will help us to do that.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing I want to leave you with today, it’s this:  For the Biden-Harris administration, this is not a standalone diplomatic issue.  It’s not just another line of effort.  We’re weaving cyber and technology diplomacy into our work across the board.  Nothing is more consequential to our competitiveness, to our security, and ultimately, to our democracy.</p>
<p>We’re in the early days of this endeavor.  All of us in the national security community have a tremendous amount to learn and even more to do.  We intend to secure American leadership.  We intend to get results for the American people.  And as we do, we will build upon the work of this commission and continue to work in partnership with you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for listening.  (Applause.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, DC</p>
<p>Mayflower Hotel</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.  Thank you all very, very much.  It is actually wonderful to be in a room with real people – (laughter) – with friends, with colleagues and without masks too.  So in and of itself, that’s a very positive thing.</p>
<p>But there is a lot to be positive about today, and it starts with the remarkable work of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, especially the work of my friend Eric Schmidt, another friend and close colleague Bob Work, who I haven’t seen yet but hopefully is here, and – Bob, there you are – and the executive director Ylli Bajraktari.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for this remarkable effort.  I am in your debt, and quite frankly the country is going to be in your debt for the work that you’ve done.  I’m going to put this down.</p>
<p>And I really want to thank the members of Congress who have come together across party lines to launch this enterprise at what is a pivotal moment for our country, and I think for the world at large.</p>
<p>Today, you’ve heard from the Secretary of Defense, you’ve heard from the Secretary of Commerce, the National Security Advisor, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p>
<p>In and of itself, that is testament to how seriously the administration takes these issues.  And again, that’s in no small part due to the work of this commission.</p>
<p>You have helped clarify the links among AI, the broader set of emerging technologies, strategic competition, and our national security and prosperity.</p>
<p>And you have made crystal clear that our country needs to play catch-up and to do it fast.  And not just our country.  Countries around the world.  And I’ll come to that.</p>
<p>We’re moving quickly, because we want to ensure that as AI and related technologies transform how we live, how we work, how we compete, how we defend ourselves, that we’re staying ahead of change, indeed that we are shaping change and, critically, making sure it delivers for our people.</p>
<p>My colleagues, I think, have very capably covered the administration’s work on these issues as it relates to our domestic renewal, our economy, and our defense.</p>
<p>So what I’d like to do today is to focus on the State Department’s distinct role, because diplomacy will be critical.</p>
<p>Working with partners and allies to develop and deploy technology is going to help us tackle the most urgent challenges we face, from pandemics to the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Diplomacy will also be essential to mitigating risks, from preventing cyber attacks that target our businesses, to regulating technology that threatens our privacy, to defending our democratic values and way of life.</p>
<p>And let me just pause for a second on that last point, because I think it deserves emphasis.  It’s fundamentally what’s at stake here.</p>
<p>More than anything else, our task is to put forth and carry out a compelling vision for how to use technology in a way that serves our people, protects our interests and upholds our democratic values.  It’s not enough to highlight the horrors of techno-authoritarianism, to point to what countries like China and Russia are doing, and say that it’s wrong and dangerous, even as it is.  We’ve also got to make the positive case for our own approach, and then we’ve got to deliver.  That is the challenge before us.</p>
<p>We need the United States and we need its partners to remain the world’s innovative leaders and standard setters, to ensure that universal rights and democratic values remain at the center of all the innovation that’s to come, and that it delivers real benefits in people’s lives.  That fundamentally is the test that we have to pass, and it’s a test I think you’ve heard President Biden allude to.</p>
<p>In short, democracies have to pass the tech test together.  And diplomacy, I believe, has a big role to play in that.</p>
<p>Now, any time you hear someone from the State Department talking, we’re likely to throw in pillars and frameworks and tranches, so I can’t be any different today.  We have to have our pillars, so let me walk you through six of them – (laughter) – that cover the approach to these issues.  I know you’d be disappointed without it.</p>
<p>The first is reducing the national security risks posed by malicious cyber activities and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>This is the most basic thing our diplomacy has to do: protect our people, protect our networks, prevent conflict, and establish standards of responsible conduct in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Already, we’ve brought countries together around an approach that recognizes international law to make it clear that countries are governed in cyberspace just like they are offline and that defines norms that apply not only in wartime but in peacetime too, because we’re now dealing with significant cyber incidents outside the context of war.</p>
<p>We’ve also called for practical confidence-building measures; for example, steps as simple as establishing points of contact, so that in the event of a major cyber incident we actually know who to call.  Under American leadership, UN member-states have come together repeatedly to reaffirm this basic framework.</p>
<p>Now we’re working to bring allies and partners along to respond collectively when others engage in malicious cyber activity.  That’s what happened after the SolarWinds intrusion.  We attributed it to Russia; 22 countries, the European Union, NATO quickly supported that conclusion.  And that’s important, because when we speak with one voice, we can more effectively deter future bad acts.</p>
<p>Last month, as some of you will have noted, at the NATO summit, NATO reaffirmed that a cyber attack could trigger Article V – “an attack on one is an attack on all” – and that’s an important step too in deterring those attacks and protecting our national security in the cyber age.</p>
<p>We’re also treating ransomware not only as a law enforcement issue but also as a national security issue.  Ransomware and other cyber crimes affect all of us – our businesses, local governments; our most critical infrastructure, from power grids to hospitals.  As you know, one in four Americans has been the victim of a cyber crime, at a cost of more than $4 billion every single year.  That’s a direct threat to the safety, to the well-being of our people, and so it’s at the top of our diplomatic agenda.</p>
<p>And it’s also why we’re elevating ransomware in our engagements with Russia.  Our message is clear:  Countries that harbor cyber criminals have a responsibility to take action.  If they don’t, we will.  We’re strengthening our diplomatic and foreign assistance tools to fight transnational cyber criminals, and we’re working to expand membership in the global cyber crime treaty known as the Budapest Convention.</p>
<p>We’ll launch similar efforts on AI and other emerging technologies.  If they’re going to be used as part of our national defense, we want the world to have a shared understanding of how to do that responsibly, in the same way that we’ve hammered out rules for how to use conventional and nuclear weapons.  That’s how we reduce the risk of proliferation.  It’s how we prevent escalation or unintended incidents.</p>
<p>The second pillar is ensuring that our leadership in the fierce strategic technology competition that’s now underway not only continues but grows and strengthens.</p>
<p>We know China is determined to become the world’s technology leader.  And they have a well-resourced and comprehensive plan to achieve those ambitions.</p>
<p>We must preserve our competitive and comparative advantages.</p>
<p>That means building resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains for critical technologies.  Our proposed investments in semiconductor manufacturing here at home is an important part of that.  And again, I really want to underscore the very important work that was done on a bipartisan basis in Congress to help allow us to do that.</p>
<p>But I think you know this too:  We can’t onshore everything.  We don’t need to.  We’ll work with partners to “friend-shore” and “near-shore” our supply chains, and that will make all of us more resilient.</p>
<p>We’ll protect information communications technologies.  The Biden-Harris administration is committed to 5G security.  And we’re promoting the use of trusted and diverse vendors, including American companies, and advocating in multilateral settings for high standards for security and for trust.</p>
<p>We’re taking a fresh look at tools like export controls, investment screening, visa screening, to make sure our strategic competitors are not exploiting our own innovative ecosystems to gain military or national security advantage.</p>
<p>Today we also know that it’s harder to ensure that American innovations are used for commercial purposes only.  Countries like China don’t differentiate between civilian and military in the same way, and emerging technologies, including AI applications, blur that line too.  So we’ve got to think differently about how to protect our innovation and industries against that kind of misuse.</p>
<p>And of course, we need to do this at the same time that we’re growing our talent pipelines.  Perhaps more than any other factor, having the right people will determine whether we win the competition for the future.  We’ve got to recruit, we’ve got to retain the top talent, including talent from around the world, so that the best and the brightest study here, stay here, feel welcome here.</p>
<p>The third pillar: defending an open, secure, reliable, and interoperable internet.</p>
<p>We’ve been fighting for this vision of the internet for a long, long time.  Many of you in this room have been engaged in that effort.  These principles created the conditions that allowed the internet to grow into the transformative force that it’s become: an extraordinary resource for learning, for connection, for economic growth.</p>
<p>But the hard truth is that the internet is also growing more closed, more insecure, more fractured every single day.</p>
<p>We see country after country putting up firewalls, controlling speech, targeting activists, shutting down the internet to squelch dissent.  And while authoritarian regimes deny access to their networks, they actively reach into others and into ours, taking advantage and meddling in more open societies.  It’s no wonder that some countries are asking whether the principles around which we’ve organized the internet are still relevant, are still tenable.</p>
<p>In many ways, we are at an inflection point, some would say even a tipping point.  And our choice is between giving up on our vision for the internet or stepping up the fight.  We will step up the fight.</p>
<p>We’ll defend the principles of an open, secure, reliable, and interoperable internet across the full spectrum of our engagement – from trade agreements to governance to hardware.  We’ll use our diplomacy to unite governments and the private sector more firmly behind these efforts.  The work we do today will determine what the internet looks like just a few years from now.  That’s a responsibility we take very, very seriously.</p>
<p>The fourth pillar I want to talk about is setting technical standards and creating norms for emerging technologies.</p>
<p>Technical standards help ensure quality, protect consumer health and safety, facilitate global interoperability.  They also help overcome trade barriers and expand market access.</p>
<p>We believe in a transparent, consensus-based, and private sector-led approach to developing standards for emerging technologies.  That’s how we’ll arrive at standards that are technologically sound, have earned people’s trust, reflect our values, and help American companies compete on a level playing field.</p>
<p>And norms, of course, are standards of another kind.  We’ll work with partners to ensure that technologies are developed and deployed in ethical ways that respect people’s rights.</p>

<p>The fifth pillar is this:  It’s making technology work for democracy.</p>
<p>Some of the leading threats to democracies today are playing out, as you all know, in cyberspace. We have to be leading the world’s efforts, and particularly the world’s democracies, in responding to those threats – fighting back against disinformation, standing up for internet freedom, reducing the misuse of surveillance technology.</p>

<p>The International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law (IIJ) today released an <em>IIJ Criminal Justice Practitioner’s Guide for Addressing Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism (REMVE)</em> developed under the IIJ REMVE initiative, supported by the United States and the United Kingdom. This Guide will assist in educating policy makers and criminal justice practitioners on how criminal judicial tools can best be deployed to counter transnational REMVE networks and actors.</p>
<p>The<em> IIJ Criminal Justice Practitioner’s Guide</em> was developed through a series of expert meetings, drawing on the first-hand professional experiences of more than 60 recognized subject-matter experts and experienced practitioners from 20 countries and international organizations across North America, Europe, and beyond. The State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism worked closely with the Department of Justice, FBI, and the Department of the Treasury to ensure the Guide reflects the U.S. Government’s considerable experience in this area.</p>
<p>The Guide affords policymakers and practitioners a compendium of the tools at their disposal. It builds on existing tools and approaches, including good practices developed by the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF), and outlines where new strategies and national authorities may be needed. The Guide also equips practitioners with a set of Good Practices for effectively addressing REMVE that encompasses trends, legislation and regulation, investigation and disruption, prosecution, prison rehabilitation and post-release monitoring, and community engagement and public outreach.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Washington, DC</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2:11 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Good afternoon.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-cuba"></a><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> All right. Happy Tuesday, everyone. Just a couple things here at the top. I wanted to start with developments in our own hemisphere.</p>
<p>As you know, President Biden and Secretary Blinken have made human rights central to our foreign policy, and I would like to address two important issues, as I said before, in our own hemisphere.</p>
<p>We continue to follow widespread, peaceful protests throughout Cuba as Cubans are calling for freedom and human rights.</p>
<p>They are standing up to Cuba&#8217;s authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>Their basic needs are not being met and they are understandably exhausted.</p>
<p>We commend the people of Cuba for showing great bravery, the strength of their will, and the power of their voice.</p>
<p>In response, the Cuban Government has attempted to silence their voices and communications through internet shutdowns, violence, and arbitrary detentions of dozens of protesters, journalists, activists, and other repressive tactics.</p>
<p>We remain deeply concerned by the Cuban Government’s, quote, “call to combat” and by the images of violence that we have seen over the past two days. We call for calm and we condemn any violence against those protesting peacefully, and we equally call on the Cuban Government to release anyone detained for peaceful protest.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-venezuela"></a> Turning to Venezuela, the United States strongly condemns the unjust detention of 2015 National Assembly representative Freddy Guevara and harassment of Interim President Juan Guaido in Venezuela.</p>
<p>These reprehensible acts are incompatible with efforts to create conditions for comprehensive negotiations between the Venezuelan opposition and the Nicolas Maduro regime to resolve Venezuela’s crisis.</p>
<p>We call for the immediate release of Congressman Guevara and urge the international community to join us in condemning his detention in the strongest terms.</p>
<p>Venezuelans have suffered for far too long under a regime that engages in widespread repression and human rights abuses, targeting those who are attempting to build a democratic country with leaders and institutions that are accountable to the people.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-china"></a> Next, as part of the whole-of-government effort, multiple U.S. agencies issued an updated Xinjiang Supply Chain Business Advisory today that describes the heightened risks for businesses that have supply chains and investment links to Xinjiang, China, due to the People’s Republic of China’s ongoing human rights abuses in the region. These include but are not limited to forced labor.</p>
<p>This business advisory was jointly issued by six U.S. Government agencies, and that includes us, the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, Homeland Security, Labor, and Treasury, along with the Office of the United States Trade Representative.</p>
<p>The advisory notes that – the Department of State’s determination that the PRC government is perpetrating genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. It cautions that given the severity and extent of these and other abuses, businesses and individuals that do not exit supply chains, ventures, and investments connected to Xinjiang could run a high risk of violating U.S. law. You can find the advisory and a fact sheet on the State Department’s website at state.gov.</p>
<p>The release of the updated advisory today underscores the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to promoting responsible business practices as well as accountability for the PRC government’s abuses in Xinjiang. I note the European Commission and the European External Action Service today published global forced labor guidance to help EU companies address the risk of forced labor and supply chains based on international due diligence guidelines. The United States and the European Union, we share concerns on the use of forced labor in global supply chains and we’re committed to working together to address this issue. We’ll continue to work with our interagency partners, the private sector, and our allies and partners around the world to promote reliable supply chains free from forced labor and call attention to human rights abuses.</p>
<p>So with that, Matt, happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks. Just logistically, if you’re – before I go to Cuba, if you’re not able to preview the ASEAN meeting that the Secretary is going to participate in tonight, can you just say if you expect that the Burmese foreign minister will be a part of this discussion?</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-asean"></a><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I would need to refer to ASEAN to discuss their participation in tonight’s meeting with Secretary Blinken – virtual meeting, that is. Of course, this will be an important opportunity, and the latest in a series of opportunities the Secretary has had, to reaffirm the centrality of ASEAN and to underscore its essential role in the Indo-Pacific’s regional architecture.</p>
<p>As you know, we’ve had a number of opportunities to engage with our ASEAN partners. We met with the chair of ASEAN in a recent trip to London several weeks ago now. Deputy Secretary Sherman has been in the region for in-person meetings herself. The Secretary has spoken bilaterally on a number of occasions to his ASEAN counterparts. But I know the Secretary is very much looking forward to this, his first meeting with his fellow ASEAN ministers.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-cuba2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. On Cuba, there are quite a few critics of the previous administration’s Cuba policy who are now, because you haven’t changed that policy at all, by extension, critics of this administration’s Cuba policy who have pointed out or made the argument that the very sharp reduction in remittances that Cuban Americans are allowed to send back to the island is one, not the – not – surely not the only, but is one reason why the basic needs of Cuban people are not being met, as – in your words.</p>
<p>Do you accept – do you see any validity to that argument? And whether you do or not, are remittances or – and allowing them or allowing them to go back up to the level that they were under the Obama administration, is that part of the review?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I would say our review is taking a broad look at what we can do to support the core principles at the center of our policy, and that is democracy and human rights. To your point, Matt, we are always considering options available to us that would allow us to support the Cuban people, to support their humanitarian needs, which are indeed profound, and they are profound because of not anything the United States has done, but from the actions and inactions, mismanagement, corruption of the Cuban regime.</p>
<p>Look, the other point I would make is that current U.S. policy, the so-called embargo, it allows humanitarian goods to reach Cuba, and we do expedite any request to export humanitarian or medical supplies to the island. We regularly authorize the export of agricultural products, medicine, medical equipment, and humanitarian goods to Cuba. And we’ve authorized billions of dollars’ worth of goods over the past couple decades, since the latest iteration of this has been in effect. But just in 2020 alone, we exported more than $175 million worth of goods to Cuba, including food and medicine, to help the Cuban people. In the first six months of 2021 alone, Cuba imported $123 million worth of, in this case, chicken from the United States.</p>
<p>Now, the pandemic has added an extra layer of pain and suffering onto the Cuban people as it has around the world, and we share the concern that the Cuban people have as they have faced an exponential rise in COVID cases across the island. Now, Cuba has made a sovereign decision regarding how it will address the pandemic, and that includes, in this case, the use of its own indigenously produced vaccine. Cuba, as you know, has not joined COVAX. The Cuban Government could always decide to receive outside vaccine donations, but the Cuban Government has decided not to do so yet.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, okay, but – so does that mean you do or do not agree with the argument that a sharp reduction in remittances has contributed to the lack of basic needs for &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, I have not seen a comprehensive study of it, so I’m not prepared to comment on that from here. What I would say, again, is that we are always looking for ways that we can support the Cuban people. We are consistent – we are constantly reviewing what policy measures might bring that about, and by “bring that about” I mean support of democracy, support for human rights on the island. That policy review is ongoing. We are engaging a wide range of stakeholders. We’re taking a close look not only what our immediate predecessor did but, of course, the actions of the Obama-Biden administration, administrations before that. Across any number of policy areas, we are seeking to learn from and to take into account the lessons of previous administrations – what they’ve done well, where there’s room to do something better or to do something different – and so that’s what we’re doing here. This is no different.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> All right. And then just the last one: You mentioned that the current U.S. policy – you called it the “so-called embargo.” What exactly would you call it?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The embargo. I’m not arguing with that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Andrea.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I follow up on that regarding remittances?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Because my understanding is that the wire transfers are part of the late November, post-election additional sanctions by the Trump administration and that that is what many Cuban Americans are complaining about, where they can no longer send – from Miami, who support the overall embargo. So I was wondering today if there was any running room, any flexibility that the administration would be considering. Then I asked that question of Senator Menendez within the last hour or two and he said absolutely not, because the Cuban Government takes 20 percent off the top on the remittances and then transfers the money to pesos, the dollars to pesos, and so the people there are getting a fraction of what their relatives are sending home.</p>
<p>That said, I understand he’s been in touch with the White House at the highest levels on this very issue today. Is there anything that the White House would do that would go against the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who wrote section two Helms-Burton?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Far be it from me to speak for our – speak for the White House. I will &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, as an administration official, how likely – especially one where nominations go through that committee and are being held by a singular – single Republican.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What I will say is that – and I think there is widespread support; we recognize this in the administration; there is widespread support for this idea in Congress – is that the idea that Americans, and especially Cuban Americans, have the potential to be, and oftentimes are, the best – our best ambassadors for what we hope to see on the island nation of Cuba. That is also central to our policy review. We have absolutely been in touch with senior members of Congress. I won’t be in a position to confirm those discussions or to read them out, but as part of our dialogue when it comes to our review of the Cuba policy, we have engaged with Congress. In the aftermath – well, I shouldn’t say the aftermath, of course; they’re still ongoing – in the midst of the protests on Cuba, we have been engaged with senior members of Congress as well.</p>
<p>We do recognize that for our policies to have the most effect, to have broad legitimacy and support, it’s important that they have, to the maximum extent possible, support of Congress, and, of course, Cuba is no different. So those consultations are ongoing. Our policy review is ongoing. Even in the midst of that review, we’re going to be looking for ways we can support the Cuban people.</p>
<p>Andrea.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, when you said that our Cuban Americans are the best advocates, the best ambassadors for democracy versus authoritarianism, let’s say – I’m paraphrasing, but that seems to be the import of what you’re saying – is there some flexibility, as you said you’re discussing with members of Congress, to some of the travel restrictions, COVID permitting?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Again, I’m not in a position to preview what we might do going forward from the podium. What I can say is that even before these protests started, we are looking for ways in the midst of COVID, in the midst of the other hardships that the Cuban people have endured because of, again, the corruption, the mismanagement of their own government – perhaps the indifference of their own government – we are looking for ways that we might support the Cuban people in a way that’s consistent with our interests, that’s consistent with our values.</p>
<p>We are, of course, doing that in the midst of these protests. These protests are about many things, but certainly the suffering of the Cuban people that is – has been made all the more acute during the pandemic. It’s top of mind. Of course, their quest for additional freedom, for human rights, central to it as well, and what we can do in a way that is responsible and effective to support those aims, including their humanitarian needs, we’ll continue to consider and move forward as appropriate.</p>
<p>Lara.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks, Ned. Yesterday Jen Psaki said at the White House podium that the United States has spent something like $20 million to support democracy assistance programs in Cuba since 2009. Can you give us some granular detail on how that money was spent? Was it mostly for broadcast channels? Was there nothing else? And if it was mostly for broadcast, was that normal operating costs, or was that above and beyond what had already been budgeted in previous years?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what Jen was referring to yesterday was the fact that we do provide economic support funds for democracy promotion programs to Cuba on an annual basis, and that amount has been $20 million per year for several years now. And now these U.S.-funded programs, they are – they do go to broadcast funding. They inform the Cuban public through support for independent media. They support Cubans to promote free expression in their communities. They increase access to information on democracy, participatory government, human rights, and market economics. They provide emergency and humanitarian assistance to human rights defenders and to political prisoners, and they prepare those who seek, who aspire, to have a voice in a free and democratic Cuba. All of this funding, all of these programs, they do adhere to the laws and the guidelines laid out in the Helms-Burton Act of 1996 and the Cuban Liberty and Solidarity Act.</p>
<p>We’ve made no secret of the fact that support for democracy, support for human rights, is really at the core of our approach to Cuba. They are going to be anchors of our – not only our policy review, but where we net out on that policy.</p>
<p>I would make one other point, that as these protests have taken place, we have seen the Cuban Government respond with internet shutdowns, with blackouts. These are government-imposed internet shutdowns. And so just as we’ve been doing with this funding, we call on Cuba’s leaders to demonstrate restraint, to urge respect for the voice of the people by opening all means of communication, both online and offline. Shutting down technology, shutting down information pathways – that does nothing to address the legitimate needs and aspirations of the Cuban people. And so we’ve been very clear on that from the start.</p>
<p>Lara.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So just to drill down a tiny bit on a technical detail, is it fair to assume that that money has come out of this building and/or USAID? And did it go strictly through NGOs?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, of course, we’re not providing any funding directly to the Cuban Government. Oftentimes, as you know, we work through partners on the ground. For additional details you may want to reach out USAID for how they may administer it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-georgia"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Ned. A couple questions about Georgia. I watched your briefing a week ago, where you talked about organized violence on Tbilisi’s streets when Georgian law enforcement, as many allege, intentionally did not stop the violent mob’s attacks on journalists and members of the LGBTQI community. After your briefing, two days ago precisely, a cameraman of TV Pirveli, my colleague, Alexander Lashkarava – this is actually him – he was beaten up by this mob and he died two days ago.</p>
<p>And so my question would be: In light of these events and the recent past events in Georgia, there are serious concerns that Georgia is diverting towards illiberalism. So is the Secretary Blinken comfortable with that development? And also what do you have to say to those people on the street right now who are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili? I might have a few follow-ups on that. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure. Well, first, of course, we extend our deepest condolences to your former colleague Lekso Lashkarava, to his family, loved ones, and of course to his colleagues, yourself included. We’re closely following the reports concerning his death. We do call for calm and an end to the violence that has already caused one tragic loss of life, in this case the death of your colleague. The safety of every Georgian journalist and the credibility of democracy in Georgia, in fact, require that every individual who attacked peaceful protesters and journalists on July 5th and 6th or those who incited violence – they must be identified; they should be arrested and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. We remind Georgia’s leaders and its law enforcement of their responsibility to protect all of those exercising their constitutional rights. We remind them of their responsibility to protect journalists exercising the freedom of press – of the press. And we encourage all Georgians, including Georgian officials, to publicly condemn this type of violence that has no place in a democracy.</p>
<p>We proudly advance efforts around the globe to protect LGBTQI populations from violence and abuse, criminalization, discrimination, and stigma, and we seek to empower local LGBTQI+ movements and persons. We firmly oppose abuses against the LGBTQI+ community and, of course, in this case, the brutal violence against your former colleague, your now deceased colleague. When it comes to the prime minister and his future, that, of course, is a decision for the Georgian people.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you. My sources on the Capitol Hill are telling me that there are talks on imposing personal sanctions against those officials in the Georgian Government who were directly responsible for the violence we all saw on July 5th. Is this an idea the State Department is also entertaining? How realistic that could be? And very lastly, I would like to know what you think about the responsibility of the opposition political parties in Georgia who are leading those people on the streets. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, we have a number of tools to hold accountable those responsible in some way for human rights abuses, for violence around the world. Sanctions are indeed one of those tools. As you know, we don’t preview sanctions before we enact them. But we are following the situation very closely, and we are committed to seeing to it that those responsible for this are held accountable.</p>
<p>When it comes to all political actors in Georgia, again, we urge them to very publicly condemn this violence. When it comes to the Georgian Government, I would reiterate our calls for a thorough investigation of this that leads to the perpetrators of this horrific crime being brought to justice.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-burma"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I wanted to ask about Myanmar. The situation in the country at the moment is that there’s a huge COVID spike and people are calling – people are sort of reporting oxygen shortages, there’s very little medical care, there seems to be very little supply of vaccines. It’s not – Myanmar has not come up, Burma has not come up in – Burma in discussion about vaccine diplomacy or vaccines for other countries. I’m wondering: Is it a possibility to send COVID vaccines or assistance to a country like Myanmar, where you’re currently not in a good relationship with the government? Is that something that you are considering? Is there any way you can give assistance to the people of the country in the current political climate there?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, to be very clear, our assistance in the form of vaccines has nothing to do with politics. And again, our goal is to put shots in arms, not to twist arms, knowing that if we are to end this pandemic here in this country and around the world, we have to be in a position to support the distribution of a safe and effective vaccine around the world. And that is precisely what we’ve been doing.</p>
<p>As you know, the President has authorized 80 million from our own domestic stockpile to be distributed. We have announced the allocation of millions of those doses to countries around the world. We have announced the purchase of 500 million Pfizer doses that will start going out next month and into 2022 as well. Working together with the international community in the context of the G7 summit earlier – it was last month now, I suppose – committed to some 1 billion vaccines for the world.</p>
<p>So just because we may not have the best of relations with a particular regime or government does not mean that that diminishes the need for that country’s people. And as you know, it’s – we have bilateral mechanisms to provide vaccines but also COVAX. COVAX is supporting the safe and effective distribution of vaccines around the world. We are working diligently through COVAX, and, in fact, three quarters of our vaccine allotment is going through COVAX. And that’s part and parcel of the $2 billion commitment we made early on to COVAX and the $4 billion total that the United States will vector towards COVAX over time. So the people of Burma are equally deserving of medical care as people around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, follow-up. So far there aren’t – there isn’t any donations of vaccines or other stuff to the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We have not made any announcements, but as you know, we continue to work with COVAX. And if we do have a Burma-specific announcement, we’ll be happy to let you know.</p>
<p>Lalit.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Ned. A follow-up on COVAX, but the country is India I wanted to ask me about. Do you know how much – figures of India receiving the COVID-19 vaccines from the U.S. so far? Has India started receiving COVID-19 vaccines from the U.S.?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So as I just said to Simon, as you know, the United States will share 80 million doses from our domestic stockpile with countries around the world. Before we can ship those doses, however, each country must complete its own domestic set of operational, of regulatory, and legal processes that are specific to each country. Now, India has determined that it needs further time to review legal provisions related to accepting vaccine donations. Once India works through its legal processes, our donations of vaccines to India will proceed expeditiously. We would need to refer you to the Government of India on the status of its discussions with COVAX, which, in this case, is helping to facilitate that delivery.</p>
<p>More broadly in the region, throughout South Asia, we’re donating millions of vaccines to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Roughly 40 million doses have been delivered worldwide so far.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So the delay in shipping COVID-19 vaccines to India is because of some regulations that India has to clear that, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I would need to refer you to the Indian Government for their processes and where they are internally. But we are ready to ship those vaccines expeditiously when we have a greenlight from the Government of India.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But have you determined how many vaccines you are planning to ship to India?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’ve announced that. I – we can get that for you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And can you also give us a sense of cooperation between India and U.S. on COVID-19 vaccines development and production and also to the third-world countries?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> And – what was the last part of your question?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And also the third-world countries.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Absolutely. So cooperation between our two countries, it is not the product of something – of only something that was built in the context of COVID. It actually builds on decades of successful partnership between our two countries in health, in biomedical research. We are partnering to strengthen the global response to COVID-19 on issues ranging from addressing infectious disease outbreaks to strengthening health systems to securing global supply chains.</p>
<p>We recently welcomed an initiative to collaborate through the International Center of Excellence in Research focused on infectious diseases, and in this case that includes COVID-19 and other emerging threats. And we look forward to an overarching MOU, a memorandum of understanding, to enhance health cooperation beyond that.</p>
<p>We are further working on diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines to combat the disease and to recognize the importance of manufacturing critical drugs during this time and to making them accessible globally. And we’re able to do that because India’s pharmaceutical sector is strong, it’s well-established, it has played a central role in manufacturing vaccines for global use over some time. And we’re pleased that U.S. pharmaceutical companies in turn are coordinating with their Indian counterparts since the beginning of the pandemic. As you know, beyond this partnership, in the context of the Quad leader’s summit, there was an agreement to work with India to boost manufacturing of COVID vaccines that would support a safe and effective and eventually universal distribution of vaccines around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> One final one. The situation – the pandemic situation in India has improved quite considerably in the last few weeks. The U.S. had imposed some travel restrictions on people coming from India. Now the situation is improving. Are you reviewing it and when do you think this will be lifted?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I would say there are a couple of things at play here. When it comes to the travel restrictions, as you know, that is something that we are taking a close look at – the U.S. Government, I should say, is taking a close look at. There are expert groups that have been formed. And “experts” in this case refers primarily to medical professionals, because for us this is not a decision about politics; this is a decision about public health and the safety of the American people but also the safety of the global traveling public. And we want to make sure that this decision is adjudicated with that central principle in mind.</p>
<p>The State Department, for our part, we also routinely issue travel advisories and we routinely update them for all countries based on a comprehensive review of available safety information and ongoing developments. We review those regularly and we make updates as warranted.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Thank you. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Ned, very much. I have a follow-up on Cuba, but first I want to ask two questions on Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-brazil"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Brazilian president wants to change next election process back to a paper vote. He has alleged that fraud in previous election, without giving evidence, and last week he threatened to cancel next election next year if there is not a clean one. So what is the administration reaction, response to these claims? And does the U.S. have confidence that the previous past elections in Brazil were fair, and the next one will also be fair?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What we call for – and this is not unique to Brazil, but it’s what we call for around the world – are free and fair elections, the ability of the people to exercise their will freely and fairly. And so the mechanics of an election are typically not of consequence to us. What is of consequence is the character of an election, and so we will be looking to see to it that elections around the world – but including in Brazil – are free and fair.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Are you being patient to these claims that the president is making? He is following Trump’s playbook when it comes to election fraud.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I would not want to characterize what the Brazilian president is saying, but I will characterize where we stand on the exercise of democracy, the ability of peoples around the world to exercise their free will, and that’s free and fair elections in our view are important. They are important in democracies; they are important in aspiring democracies. They are a key metric as we determine the health of democracies and the health of participatory electoral systems around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And another one, because harassment against journalists also in Brazil has increased since President Bolsonaro took office. Last week the organization Reporters Without Borders included Bolsonaro on a list of press predators, alongside 37 authoritarian leaders like Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin. And also last week president’s lawyer sent a message to a female reporter saying that in China, she would be – she would disappear and her body would not be found. So what is – is this kind of threat is something that worries this administration, coming from Bolsonaro’s government?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, generally the department is always concerned when journalists face threats of harassment, face threats of intimidation, and especially when there are threats of violence. We already spoke of one especially tragic case during the course of this briefing. Freedom of the press, freedom of expression more broadly, is something we support around the world. In order to have freedom of the press, freedom of expression, you have to stand up for the safety and security of journalists and reporters around the world. So I haven’t taken a close look at the study you mentioned, but we certainly have seen, broadly speaking, an uptick in threats of intimidation, threats of violence of reporters globally.</p>
<p>As you know, the Secretary, just in advance of World Press Freedom Day, in May of this year, hosted a group of journalists, many of whom have faced intimidation, threats of violence in their own work. And we did that very purposefully, to put a spotlight on this challenge. And it’s a challenge that not only comes from governments; sometimes nongovernmental organizations and actors, terrorist groups, and others take part in this. But journalists should never face threats, face danger in the course of their work for what it is they may report, for what it is they may uncover.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Would these violations of human rights impact the bilateral relationship between Brazil and the U.S., since you are saying this administration put human rights at the center of foreign policy?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, that’s exactly the point. And it’s not unique to Brazil; it’s not unique to any one country. But in every relationship we have – this includes with our closest partners; it includes those with whom we may have profound disagreements – we are always going to be taking a close look at a country’s human rights record to seek improvement where we can, but ultimately to see to it that people around the world are protected in exercising their universal rights, their universal freedoms. The United States will always be a voice for that. Oftentimes we do make that point publicly, but in private conversations as well we don’t shy away, and we do what we can in our assessment as – in the means most effective for us to protect and to safeguard human rights around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just – can I do a very quick follow-up on Cuba?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-cuba3"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Because during the campaign, President Biden said that Trump’s reversals on Cuba policy have inflicted harm to the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights. So does President Biden still want to change Trump’s policy on Cuba? And when would be a good time, if not now?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we are undertaking a review of our – of a Cuba policy precisely to determine how best we can support the human rights of Cubans, how best we can support the prospect for democracy on the island. Now, of course, successive administrations have sought in some ways to do that, and so as I said before, we are going to be taking a close look at what has and has not worked in the past, and unfortunately, in the case of Cuba there may be more that has not worked than what has worked. And so we are going to be, as we’ve done in other cases as well, studying that very closely to determine what we can do most effectively, consistent with our values, consistent with our interests, to move the ball forward, especially when it comes to democracy and human rights.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Will Cuba become a priority now, after the events on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, of course, you heard from the President directly, you heard from the Secretary directly standing right here. We have not been shy about speaking to what is going on. Of course, it’s always a priority for us when citizens are taking to the streets peacefully to express their aspirations for democracy and human rights. We’ll continue to watch this very closely.</p>
<p>Yes, Rich.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I want to stay in the hemisphere.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’ll – in the hemisphere? Were you staying in the hemisphere?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I was going to go to a different hemisphere.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, let’s stay in the hemisphere. I’ll come right back to you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Go ahead.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-haiti"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So in Haiti – is the U.S. team in Haiti assisting the assassination investigation part of a U.S. foreign emergency support team? Do you know who from this building was part of the U.S. delegation went to Haiti on Sunday? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Right. So there was an interagency delegation that was in Haiti on Sunday. DAS Lochman from our Western Hemisphere Affairs Bureau represented the department in discussions on Sunday. The team was deployed in order to take part in an assessment of how best the United States can support the Haitian people as they respond to this. Right now we’re focusing on that investigation, what we might be able to do to support the Haitian investigation into the assassination of President Moise.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is anyone from the FEST, the foreign emergency support team, there?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I – we’ll get back to you on that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Uh-huh. And what is the U.S. message to Haitian people standing outside of U.S. embassy, asking for political asylum?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I understand that the situation in front of our Embassy in Port-au-Prince is now calm. The groups that were gathered there, I understand, have dissipated. As we do around the world, we encourage Haitians, in this case, not to gather in front of our embassy. For their own safety, for their own security, we continue to urge calm across the – across Haiti. We have heard Acting Prime Minister Joseph make very similar calls, other political actors make similar calls, calling for calm. We reiterate those. That is precisely what Haiti needs, as Haiti’s political actors, we hope, will work together in the interests of the Haitian people to make meaningful progress in efforts to form a consensus government that can lead to free and fair elections.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So have the Haitians made any requests that you guys have said no to?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Right now we are evaluating a number of requests. We are evaluating how best we can support the needs of the Haitian Government at the moment. As I said right now, much of that focuses on the ongoing investigation into the killing of President Moise. In addition to the interagency team, the FBI and DHS have been engaged on the ground as well to determine the investigative assets, investigative support that Haiti may need on its investigation.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So does that mean the answer is no, you haven’t denied any requests, at least yet?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’re still evaluating. I don’t believe we &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, fine. But have you said no to anything?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. I don’t believe we have denied any requests right yet, but we’re still evaluating quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one follow-up &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But as you said yesterday, the focus is on the investigation rather than security assistance, which was a request. So is there a response to that request?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, as I think you’ve heard from the Pentagon and from the White House, we are evaluating requests for assistance, just as we would requests from assistance in other contexts. We know in this case that there may be needs for protection in the context of critical infrastructure. We’re taking a close look at that as well. FBI and DHS, as I said before, have been engaging with their Haitian counterparts, but all of these requests we’re evaluating in line with our assessment of how we can best assist the Haitian people and the Haitian Government.</p>
<p>Rich.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-olympics"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks, Ned. The European Parliament has voted for a diplomatic boycott of the upcoming Winter Olympics. Does the U.S. support that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Do we support their &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> They’re boycotting. Would – is the U.S. considering or will the U.S. follow suit and do the same?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we are – what is true is that we are closely consulting with allies and partners, as well as other actors, including the business community, to identify common concerns and, ideally, to establish a common approach regarding the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games. We’ll continue to speak out consistently in the meantime, and again, jointly with allies and partners when it comes to what we’re seeing from PRC officials. And we’ll continue to impose costs and sanctions on those responsible for human rights abuses, including the state sponsorship of forced labor. And just today, as I said at the outset of the briefing, you saw the updated business advisory that came from the Department of State and several of our interagency partners. But right now, we are engaged in discussions to establish those common concerns, and I don’t have anything for you beyond that.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-china2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did the U.S. – as you – as the U.S. engages with its allies on this decision-making process, did the European Union or those countries engage? Was that – their decision the result of consultations with the United States?</p>
<p>And then sort of separately on your talking about the business community and today’s advisory, can you confirm that we can expect one on Hong Kong? And the Xinjiang advisory is about three dozen pages. Succinctly, what is the message to the business community? That this type of activity, knowingly having forced labor in your supply chains, is immoral – which it is, clearly, in the statement – or is it illegal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I think what we said in – at the outset is that companies that engage with entities and who are enmeshed in supply chains in Xinjiang do face potential legal exposure. And the business advisory was quite clear on that.</p>
<p>When it comes to the EU and how they arrived at this decision, I’m not going to speak for the EU. I will let them speak for themselves. I will say that the EU, of course, is an important partner when it comes to any number of issues, and that in part is predicated on our shared values. And I would make the broader point that you have seen a great deal of convergence between the United States and our European allies on – based on those values in the context of the PRC and Xinjiang in particular. Let me give you just a few examples.</p>
<p>At the G7 summit, President Biden and Chancellor Merkel outlined our shared positions on China. The President had an opportunity to meet with a number of his other counterparts, including British Prime Minister Johnson and others, to discuss the importance of coordinating and responding to China’s non-market practices and the need to speak out on human rights abuses, including in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. The communique that resulted from the G7 summit also addressed the need for action against forced labor practices in the agricultural, solar, and garment sectors. There was an entire paragraph – paragraph 49, I belive it was – dedicated to this issue and showcasing the convergence.</p>
<p>At the NATO summit, the communique for the first time ever addressed the security challenges from China. And the United States and our NATO Allies, many of whom are European, of course, agreed to draft a new strategic concept, a framework that will guide the Alliance’s approach to the evolving strategic environment in the coming years – not only to address Russia’s aggressive actions, but also those posed by the PRC to our collective security.</p>
<p>And then, of course, at the U.S.-EU summit the leaders launched the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, the goal – whose goal is to write the rules of the road for the economy of the 21st century in areas like emerging technology and competition policy. And we’ve also put forward a series of affirmative ideas, Build Back Better World being at the center of this, offering and making clear that, one, democracies can deliver; and two, there is an alternative, attractive model to what other countries may be offering here.</p>
<p>When it comes to Hong Kong, we don’t have anything to announce at this time regarding future policy moves. You’ve heard from us on any number of occasions our concern regarding Beijing’s ongoing attempts to undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy, to dismantle its democratic institutions and processes. We’ll continue to call international attention to and to hold PRC and Hong Kong authorities accountable for the erosion of the rule of law in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>I would make one additional broader point here. We know that a healthy business community relies on the rule of law, which the national security law that applies to Hong Kong continues to undermine. As a general matter, we seek to ensure that businesses can operate in a stable, predictable, and fair regulatory environments around the world. And rule of law risks that were formerly limited to mainland China are now increasingly a concern in Hong Kong. That’s of great concern to us. It is of great concern to the American business community. It’s of great concern to the international business community.</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-haiti2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On Cuba – just because you’re on Cuba – my colleague asked about the urgency of this ongoing policy review. Is there a timeline for completion? I think we’ve continued to ask, and obviously the protests sort of lend a greater immediacy to the question.</p>
<p>And then on Haiti, are you – is the administration particularly concerned about instability in the country as a result of this dispute over control of the government? And is the State Department or the interagency going to continue to engage with all of the claimants to power?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we have engaged with a wide variety of stakeholders in Haiti. The interagency delegation that was there over the weekend met with Claude Joseph, Ariel Henry, Joseph Lambert, and others. And we have continued to urge these political actors to work together in the interests of the Haitian people.</p>
<p>We have called on Haitian political leaders, the Haitian private sector, civil society to come together to – importantly, to strengthen the democratic institutions and to reach an inclusive solution that will facilitate peace and stability and lead to presidential and legislative elections.</p>
<p>For us, this is about – the guiding principles are Haiti’s constitution, its institutions, and we have urged Haitian political actors to work together in the interests of their people to make meaningful progress in that effort to form a consensus government that ultimately can lead to free and fair elections. And of course, the Haitian constitution calls for those free and fair elections later this year.</p>
<p>Beyond this immediate political situation, Haiti’s political gridlock has long taken a great toll on the country, and it’s vital for Haiti’s leaders to finally come together to chart a united path for the country. The United States will continue to be a partner to the Haitian people. We will continue to engage constructively with Haiti’s political actors and its broader set of stakeholders to do what we can to help support Haiti’s political leaders finding this consensus solution.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-cuba4"></a> On the Cuba policy review, of course, we are moving as expeditiously as appropriate in this case. We are making sure that we are consulting with, as I said before, a broad and wide variety of stakeholders. We are taking a close look at what the United States can best do to support the needs of the Cuban people, to support their legitimate and long-denied aspirations for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p>Shaun.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-egypt"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask about Egypt?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> There was a report yesterday in Politico that Mohamed Soltan, whose case I’m sure you’re familiar with, that there was an agreement by the State Department under the previous administration, at least something signed, to the effect that he would be again in custody of the United States and that Egypt’s intelligence chief has raised that again.</p>
<p>First of all, is there any truth to the – to that initial finding that there was some document there? Was this raised? And do you have any comment overall on his situation now?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we’re aware of the document that was reported related to Mohamed Soltan, of course, a U.S. citizen. He was formerly imprisoned in Egypt. We don’t have a comment on its legal authority.</p>
<p>What I would remind you, though, is what we said at the time: The United States condemned the detention of Mr. Soltan and we called for his immediate release. It’s something that we worked for very assiduously.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Could you say whether the Egyptians have raised this again?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’m not in a position to detail that.</p>
<p>Lara.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-iran"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Staying in that region, if we could go to Iran. There is a report out of Tehran today that a government spokesman said that Iran and the United States are negotiating for prisoners exchanges.</p>
<p>First, I assume that was not a direct negotiation, but if it was, could you please comment?</p>
<p>And then secondly, this seems like a good opportunity to ask about the status of the talks and what effort is being made to break the current stalemate, or hold, or logjam, or whatever we want to call it.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, first on the question of detainees, you are correct; it is indirect but active discussions taking place on this – to this end, seeing the release of the Americans who have been unjustly detained, deprived of their freedom for far too long now. We are treating the issue of detainees independently from discussions of the JCPOA, as you know. It&#8217;s really a matter of us to see to it that these detainees are released as soon as possible. We are working with the utmost urgency and we want it to be resolved immediately. We&#8217;re working night and day to bring these detainees, these American citizens home. We&#8217;re also working with our allies, many of whom also have citizens currently arbitrarily or wrongfully detained by the Iranian Government.</p>
<p>Look, the broader point is that Iran&#8217;s unjust imprisonment of U.S. citizens for use as political leverage, it&#8217;s abhorrent, it&#8217;s outrageous. Our priority is bringing these individuals home as possible and resolving the cases of missing and abducted U.S. citizens just as quickly as we can.</p>
<p>When it comes to the status of the talks, we&#8217;ve discussed this yesterday, but questions about when or whether Iran would be prepared to start a seventh round of talks or to reach an understanding on a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA, those questions have to be addressed to Tehran. They can&#8217;t be addressed to us. As we&#8217;ve made clear, we are prepared to continue engaging in the context of these indirect negotiations with Iran. We&#8217;re prepared to return to a seventh round of talks. We&#8217;ve been equally clear that there&#8217;s not a deadline, a firm deadline that we have in mind as of right now, but we&#8217;ve made no secret of the fact that we are considering the implications of Iran’s nuclear advances for a potential return to the JCPOA. So we&#8217;re watching very closely.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Great. Ned, just on the indirect, active – indirect but active discussions on the – is there anything new about this today other than the fact that an Iranian official said this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Anything new over the course of the last couple months? We&#8217;ve known about these talks for some time. They&#8217;ve been going on, yes, separately from the nuclear talks, but still they&#8217;ve been going on. And I think that senior officials who we all know has talked about it pretty openly.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I – correct me, Lara, if I&#8217;m wrong, but I think Lara asked a question just based on what an Iranian official said.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No, no, no, I know. But I&#8217;m wondering, it&#8217;s – I’m not saying it&#8217;s not a valid question. I just wonder if there&#8217;s anything new today that was not new last week or the week before or the month – a month before or two months or three months.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Matt, I think we have found in the cases – in the case of Americans who are held against their will unjustly around the world that these discussions are best undertaken quietly, and we often don&#8217;t speak to the details from the podium precisely because we are doing everything we can and working as urgently as we can to secure their release. I&#8217;m just not in a position to update on where these indirect discussions may be.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, yeah, but they&#8217;ve been going on for months, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, they&#8217;ve been going on before this administration took office. I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>That’s – yes, I mean – okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-indopacificasean"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah, thank you, Ned. Two questions, please. First, on the Secretary&#8217;s ASEAN foreign ministers meeting later this evening, last week Kurt Campbell spoke at an event where he said I think we have been “missing in action” in many respects in the Pacific. He said we recognize fully that for an effective Asia strategy you must do more in Southeast Asia. And he said we want in the next little while to step up our game substantially.</p>
<p>So first, would the State Department agree that the U.S. has been missing in action in the Pacific? And will the Secretary&#8217;s message today be about greater U.S. engagement in Southeast Asia? And then I have a follow-up on China.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So this is a region, the Indo-Pacific, that is vitally important to us for any number of interests, but also our values. I think what the Secretary will say tonight – and I expect we&#8217;ll have a readout after the session concludes – is a reaffirmation of our commitment to ASEAN’s centrality and a reaffirmation of ASEAN’s central and essential role in the Indo-Pacific’s regional architecture. The Secretary will have the first opportunity tonight to speak to ASEAN – at least to the foreign ministers – as a whole, but as you know, we did meet with the Bruneian foreign minister in London, current chair of ASEAN; the Secretary has been in contact bilaterally with – over the phone and in person with a number of ASEAN members. Deputy Secretary Sherman was – traveled to the region several weeks ago, where she met with ASEAN counterparts.</p>
<p>So I think both in terms of word and deed, we have demonstrated our commitment to the centrality of ASEAN. We know of its indispensable and central role to the regional architecture. But I wouldn’t want to get ahead of the Secretary’s engagement tonight.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-china3"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And then – excuse me – on China, China’s Foreign Ministry has responded to yesterday’s atrocities report, and they’ve said that the U.S. is no position to point fingers at other countries’ human rights situation. They gave examples of past treatment of Native Americans, I think they brought up George Floyd, and they called the report a waste of paper. Do you have any response to that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have a response to that. I will just say, without commenting on what sounds like the PRC playbook, that we have been very clear that as part of our commitment to human rights – our defense, our promotion of human rights around the world – that as a confident democracy, as a country that is comfortable and confident in its standing, we can be open, we can be transparent about where we have veered off course, where we have not met the ideals that – towards which we strive every day. After all, and as we often like to point out, this country was not born a perfect union. It is our essential mission every day to form a more perfect union.</p>
<p>Where that imperfection has been on display, at least speaking for this administration, we have not sought to sweep it under the rug, we’ve not sought to hide it from the rest of the world. We know that for the health, for the wellbeing of our own democracy, it’s important that we are open and transparent but also to be the model that we aspire to be for other democracies and aspiring democracies around the world. We set an important example by comporting ourselves in that.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, everyone. Very quick? Very – yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-russiaclimate"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Quickly, Special Envoy John Kerry’s meeting in Russia, because it was reported by media reports that the U.S. is trying to setting up some proposal to work with Russia on climate change. Do you have any readout on his meetings in Russia?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have a readout at the moment. I do expect that the special envoy’s office will be in a position to provide additional details at the conclusion of his meetings there. Of course, it is not a secret that we have profound differences with the Russian Federation on any number of issues, and I need not go into them. But it’s also not a secret – and you saw this in the form of President Biden meeting with President Putin – that we believe there are going to be certain areas where our interests align. And you saw that in the context of an agreement last week announced to extend the Syrian humanitarian corridor by 12 months; you see that in – you saw that in the renewal of the New START agreement for five years in the first days of this administration; and Secretary Kerry at the moment is testing the proposition as to whether we can work together on the global and existential challenge of climate change. Russia is one of the world’s most prolific emitters, and so Russia has a responsibility, as does the United States, to be ambitious in its climate targets.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I – so do you expect Secretary Kerry to go to Brazil as well this year before the summit?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have any forthcoming travel to announce. I would have to refer you to his office for that.</p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 3:13 p.m.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Washington, DC</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2:11 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Good afternoon.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-cuba"></a><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> All right. Happy Tuesday, everyone. Just a couple things here at the top. I wanted to start with developments in our own hemisphere.</p>
<p>As you know, President Biden and Secretary Blinken have made human rights central to our foreign policy, and I would like to address two important issues, as I said before, in our own hemisphere.</p>
<p>We continue to follow widespread, peaceful protests throughout Cuba as Cubans are calling for freedom and human rights.</p>
<p>They are standing up to Cuba&#8217;s authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>Their basic needs are not being met and they are understandably exhausted.</p>
<p>We commend the people of Cuba for showing great bravery, the strength of their will, and the power of their voice.</p>
<p>In response, the Cuban Government has attempted to silence their voices and communications through internet shutdowns, violence, and arbitrary detentions of dozens of protesters, journalists, activists, and other repressive tactics.</p>
<p>We remain deeply concerned by the Cuban Government’s, quote, “call to combat” and by the images of violence that we have seen over the past two days. We call for calm and we condemn any violence against those protesting peacefully, and we equally call on the Cuban Government to release anyone detained for peaceful protest.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-venezuela"></a> Turning to Venezuela, the United States strongly condemns the unjust detention of 2015 National Assembly representative Freddy Guevara and harassment of Interim President Juan Guaido in Venezuela.</p>
<p>These reprehensible acts are incompatible with efforts to create conditions for comprehensive negotiations between the Venezuelan opposition and the Nicolas Maduro regime to resolve Venezuela’s crisis.</p>
<p>We call for the immediate release of Congressman Guevara and urge the international community to join us in condemning his detention in the strongest terms.</p>
<p>Venezuelans have suffered for far too long under a regime that engages in widespread repression and human rights abuses, targeting those who are attempting to build a democratic country with leaders and institutions that are accountable to the people.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-china"></a> Next, as part of the whole-of-government effort, multiple U.S. agencies issued an updated Xinjiang Supply Chain Business Advisory today that describes the heightened risks for businesses that have supply chains and investment links to Xinjiang, China, due to the People’s Republic of China’s ongoing human rights abuses in the region. These include but are not limited to forced labor.</p>
<p>This business advisory was jointly issued by six U.S. Government agencies, and that includes us, the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, Homeland Security, Labor, and Treasury, along with the Office of the United States Trade Representative.</p>
<p>The advisory notes that – the Department of State’s determination that the PRC government is perpetrating genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. It cautions that given the severity and extent of these and other abuses, businesses and individuals that do not exit supply chains, ventures, and investments connected to Xinjiang could run a high risk of violating U.S. law. You can find the advisory and a fact sheet on the State Department’s website at state.gov.</p>
<p>The release of the updated advisory today underscores the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to promoting responsible business practices as well as accountability for the PRC government’s abuses in Xinjiang. I note the European Commission and the European External Action Service today published global forced labor guidance to help EU companies address the risk of forced labor and supply chains based on international due diligence guidelines. The United States and the European Union, we share concerns on the use of forced labor in global supply chains and we’re committed to working together to address this issue. We’ll continue to work with our interagency partners, the private sector, and our allies and partners around the world to promote reliable supply chains free from forced labor and call attention to human rights abuses.</p>
<p>So with that, Matt, happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks. Just logistically, if you’re – before I go to Cuba, if you’re not able to preview the ASEAN meeting that the Secretary is going to participate in tonight, can you just say if you expect that the Burmese foreign minister will be a part of this discussion?</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-asean"></a><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I would need to refer to ASEAN to discuss their participation in tonight’s meeting with Secretary Blinken – virtual meeting, that is. Of course, this will be an important opportunity, and the latest in a series of opportunities the Secretary has had, to reaffirm the centrality of ASEAN and to underscore its essential role in the Indo-Pacific’s regional architecture.</p>
<p>As you know, we’ve had a number of opportunities to engage with our ASEAN partners. We met with the chair of ASEAN in a recent trip to London several weeks ago now. Deputy Secretary Sherman has been in the region for in-person meetings herself. The Secretary has spoken bilaterally on a number of occasions to his ASEAN counterparts. But I know the Secretary is very much looking forward to this, his first meeting with his fellow ASEAN ministers.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-cuba2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. On Cuba, there are quite a few critics of the previous administration’s Cuba policy who are now, because you haven’t changed that policy at all, by extension, critics of this administration’s Cuba policy who have pointed out or made the argument that the very sharp reduction in remittances that Cuban Americans are allowed to send back to the island is one, not the – not – surely not the only, but is one reason why the basic needs of Cuban people are not being met, as – in your words.</p>
<p>Do you accept – do you see any validity to that argument? And whether you do or not, are remittances or – and allowing them or allowing them to go back up to the level that they were under the Obama administration, is that part of the review?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I would say our review is taking a broad look at what we can do to support the core principles at the center of our policy, and that is democracy and human rights. To your point, Matt, we are always considering options available to us that would allow us to support the Cuban people, to support their humanitarian needs, which are indeed profound, and they are profound because of not anything the United States has done, but from the actions and inactions, mismanagement, corruption of the Cuban regime.</p>
<p>Look, the other point I would make is that current U.S. policy, the so-called embargo, it allows humanitarian goods to reach Cuba, and we do expedite any request to export humanitarian or medical supplies to the island. We regularly authorize the export of agricultural products, medicine, medical equipment, and humanitarian goods to Cuba. And we’ve authorized billions of dollars’ worth of goods over the past couple decades, since the latest iteration of this has been in effect. But just in 2020 alone, we exported more than $175 million worth of goods to Cuba, including food and medicine, to help the Cuban people. In the first six months of 2021 alone, Cuba imported $123 million worth of, in this case, chicken from the United States.</p>
<p>Now, the pandemic has added an extra layer of pain and suffering onto the Cuban people as it has around the world, and we share the concern that the Cuban people have as they have faced an exponential rise in COVID cases across the island. Now, Cuba has made a sovereign decision regarding how it will address the pandemic, and that includes, in this case, the use of its own indigenously produced vaccine. Cuba, as you know, has not joined COVAX. The Cuban Government could always decide to receive outside vaccine donations, but the Cuban Government has decided not to do so yet.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, okay, but – so does that mean you do or do not agree with the argument that a sharp reduction in remittances has contributed to the lack of basic needs for &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, I have not seen a comprehensive study of it, so I’m not prepared to comment on that from here. What I would say, again, is that we are always looking for ways that we can support the Cuban people. We are consistent – we are constantly reviewing what policy measures might bring that about, and by “bring that about” I mean support of democracy, support for human rights on the island. That policy review is ongoing. We are engaging a wide range of stakeholders. We’re taking a close look not only what our immediate predecessor did but, of course, the actions of the Obama-Biden administration, administrations before that. Across any number of policy areas, we are seeking to learn from and to take into account the lessons of previous administrations – what they’ve done well, where there’s room to do something better or to do something different – and so that’s what we’re doing here. This is no different.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> All right. And then just the last one: You mentioned that the current U.S. policy – you called it the “so-called embargo.” What exactly would you call it?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The embargo. I’m not arguing with that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Andrea.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I follow up on that regarding remittances?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Because my understanding is that the wire transfers are part of the late November, post-election additional sanctions by the Trump administration and that that is what many Cuban Americans are complaining about, where they can no longer send – from Miami, who support the overall embargo. So I was wondering today if there was any running room, any flexibility that the administration would be considering. Then I asked that question of Senator Menendez within the last hour or two and he said absolutely not, because the Cuban Government takes 20 percent off the top on the remittances and then transfers the money to pesos, the dollars to pesos, and so the people there are getting a fraction of what their relatives are sending home.</p>
<p>That said, I understand he’s been in touch with the White House at the highest levels on this very issue today. Is there anything that the White House would do that would go against the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who wrote section two Helms-Burton?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Far be it from me to speak for our – speak for the White House. I will &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, as an administration official, how likely – especially one where nominations go through that committee and are being held by a singular – single Republican.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What I will say is that – and I think there is widespread support; we recognize this in the administration; there is widespread support for this idea in Congress – is that the idea that Americans, and especially Cuban Americans, have the potential to be, and oftentimes are, the best – our best ambassadors for what we hope to see on the island nation of Cuba. That is also central to our policy review. We have absolutely been in touch with senior members of Congress. I won’t be in a position to confirm those discussions or to read them out, but as part of our dialogue when it comes to our review of the Cuba policy, we have engaged with Congress. In the aftermath – well, I shouldn’t say the aftermath, of course; they’re still ongoing – in the midst of the protests on Cuba, we have been engaged with senior members of Congress as well.</p>
<p>We do recognize that for our policies to have the most effect, to have broad legitimacy and support, it’s important that they have, to the maximum extent possible, support of Congress, and, of course, Cuba is no different. So those consultations are ongoing. Our policy review is ongoing. Even in the midst of that review, we’re going to be looking for ways we can support the Cuban people.</p>
<p>Andrea.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, when you said that our Cuban Americans are the best advocates, the best ambassadors for democracy versus authoritarianism, let’s say – I’m paraphrasing, but that seems to be the import of what you’re saying – is there some flexibility, as you said you’re discussing with members of Congress, to some of the travel restrictions, COVID permitting?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Again, I’m not in a position to preview what we might do going forward from the podium. What I can say is that even before these protests started, we are looking for ways in the midst of COVID, in the midst of the other hardships that the Cuban people have endured because of, again, the corruption, the mismanagement of their own government – perhaps the indifference of their own government – we are looking for ways that we might support the Cuban people in a way that’s consistent with our interests, that’s consistent with our values.</p>
<p>We are, of course, doing that in the midst of these protests. These protests are about many things, but certainly the suffering of the Cuban people that is – has been made all the more acute during the pandemic. It’s top of mind. Of course, their quest for additional freedom, for human rights, central to it as well, and what we can do in a way that is responsible and effective to support those aims, including their humanitarian needs, we’ll continue to consider and move forward as appropriate.</p>
<p>Lara.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks, Ned. Yesterday Jen Psaki said at the White House podium that the United States has spent something like $20 million to support democracy assistance programs in Cuba since 2009. Can you give us some granular detail on how that money was spent? Was it mostly for broadcast channels? Was there nothing else? And if it was mostly for broadcast, was that normal operating costs, or was that above and beyond what had already been budgeted in previous years?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what Jen was referring to yesterday was the fact that we do provide economic support funds for democracy promotion programs to Cuba on an annual basis, and that amount has been $20 million per year for several years now. And now these U.S.-funded programs, they are – they do go to broadcast funding. They inform the Cuban public through support for independent media. They support Cubans to promote free expression in their communities. They increase access to information on democracy, participatory government, human rights, and market economics. They provide emergency and humanitarian assistance to human rights defenders and to political prisoners, and they prepare those who seek, who aspire, to have a voice in a free and democratic Cuba. All of this funding, all of these programs, they do adhere to the laws and the guidelines laid out in the Helms-Burton Act of 1996 and the Cuban Liberty and Solidarity Act.</p>
<p>We’ve made no secret of the fact that support for democracy, support for human rights, is really at the core of our approach to Cuba. They are going to be anchors of our – not only our policy review, but where we net out on that policy.</p>
<p>I would make one other point, that as these protests have taken place, we have seen the Cuban Government respond with internet shutdowns, with blackouts. These are government-imposed internet shutdowns. And so just as we’ve been doing with this funding, we call on Cuba’s leaders to demonstrate restraint, to urge respect for the voice of the people by opening all means of communication, both online and offline. Shutting down technology, shutting down information pathways – that does nothing to address the legitimate needs and aspirations of the Cuban people. And so we’ve been very clear on that from the start.</p>
<p>Lara.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So just to drill down a tiny bit on a technical detail, is it fair to assume that that money has come out of this building and/or USAID? And did it go strictly through NGOs?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, of course, we’re not providing any funding directly to the Cuban Government. Oftentimes, as you know, we work through partners on the ground. For additional details you may want to reach out USAID for how they may administer it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-georgia"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Ned. A couple questions about Georgia. I watched your briefing a week ago, where you talked about organized violence on Tbilisi’s streets when Georgian law enforcement, as many allege, intentionally did not stop the violent mob’s attacks on journalists and members of the LGBTQI community. After your briefing, two days ago precisely, a cameraman of TV Pirveli, my colleague, Alexander Lashkarava – this is actually him – he was beaten up by this mob and he died two days ago.</p>
<p>And so my question would be: In light of these events and the recent past events in Georgia, there are serious concerns that Georgia is diverting towards illiberalism. So is the Secretary Blinken comfortable with that development? And also what do you have to say to those people on the street right now who are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili? I might have a few follow-ups on that. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure. Well, first, of course, we extend our deepest condolences to your former colleague Lekso Lashkarava, to his family, loved ones, and of course to his colleagues, yourself included. We’re closely following the reports concerning his death. We do call for calm and an end to the violence that has already caused one tragic loss of life, in this case the death of your colleague. The safety of every Georgian journalist and the credibility of democracy in Georgia, in fact, require that every individual who attacked peaceful protesters and journalists on July 5th and 6th or those who incited violence – they must be identified; they should be arrested and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. We remind Georgia’s leaders and its law enforcement of their responsibility to protect all of those exercising their constitutional rights. We remind them of their responsibility to protect journalists exercising the freedom of press – of the press. And we encourage all Georgians, including Georgian officials, to publicly condemn this type of violence that has no place in a democracy.</p>
<p>We proudly advance efforts around the globe to protect LGBTQI populations from violence and abuse, criminalization, discrimination, and stigma, and we seek to empower local LGBTQI+ movements and persons. We firmly oppose abuses against the LGBTQI+ community and, of course, in this case, the brutal violence against your former colleague, your now deceased colleague. When it comes to the prime minister and his future, that, of course, is a decision for the Georgian people.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you. My sources on the Capitol Hill are telling me that there are talks on imposing personal sanctions against those officials in the Georgian Government who were directly responsible for the violence we all saw on July 5th. Is this an idea the State Department is also entertaining? How realistic that could be? And very lastly, I would like to know what you think about the responsibility of the opposition political parties in Georgia who are leading those people on the streets. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, we have a number of tools to hold accountable those responsible in some way for human rights abuses, for violence around the world. Sanctions are indeed one of those tools. As you know, we don’t preview sanctions before we enact them. But we are following the situation very closely, and we are committed to seeing to it that those responsible for this are held accountable.</p>
<p>When it comes to all political actors in Georgia, again, we urge them to very publicly condemn this violence. When it comes to the Georgian Government, I would reiterate our calls for a thorough investigation of this that leads to the perpetrators of this horrific crime being brought to justice.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-burma"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I wanted to ask about Myanmar. The situation in the country at the moment is that there’s a huge COVID spike and people are calling – people are sort of reporting oxygen shortages, there’s very little medical care, there seems to be very little supply of vaccines. It’s not – Myanmar has not come up, Burma has not come up in – Burma in discussion about vaccine diplomacy or vaccines for other countries. I’m wondering: Is it a possibility to send COVID vaccines or assistance to a country like Myanmar, where you’re currently not in a good relationship with the government? Is that something that you are considering? Is there any way you can give assistance to the people of the country in the current political climate there?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, to be very clear, our assistance in the form of vaccines has nothing to do with politics. And again, our goal is to put shots in arms, not to twist arms, knowing that if we are to end this pandemic here in this country and around the world, we have to be in a position to support the distribution of a safe and effective vaccine around the world. And that is precisely what we’ve been doing.</p>
<p>As you know, the President has authorized 80 million from our own domestic stockpile to be distributed. We have announced the allocation of millions of those doses to countries around the world. We have announced the purchase of 500 million Pfizer doses that will start going out next month and into 2022 as well. Working together with the international community in the context of the G7 summit earlier – it was last month now, I suppose – committed to some 1 billion vaccines for the world.</p>
<p>So just because we may not have the best of relations with a particular regime or government does not mean that that diminishes the need for that country’s people. And as you know, it’s – we have bilateral mechanisms to provide vaccines but also COVAX. COVAX is supporting the safe and effective distribution of vaccines around the world. We are working diligently through COVAX, and, in fact, three quarters of our vaccine allotment is going through COVAX. And that’s part and parcel of the $2 billion commitment we made early on to COVAX and the $4 billion total that the United States will vector towards COVAX over time. So the people of Burma are equally deserving of medical care as people around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, follow-up. So far there aren’t – there isn’t any donations of vaccines or other stuff to the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We have not made any announcements, but as you know, we continue to work with COVAX. And if we do have a Burma-specific announcement, we’ll be happy to let you know.</p>
<p>Lalit.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Ned. A follow-up on COVAX, but the country is India I wanted to ask me about. Do you know how much – figures of India receiving the COVID-19 vaccines from the U.S. so far? Has India started receiving COVID-19 vaccines from the U.S.?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So as I just said to Simon, as you know, the United States will share 80 million doses from our domestic stockpile with countries around the world. Before we can ship those doses, however, each country must complete its own domestic set of operational, of regulatory, and legal processes that are specific to each country. Now, India has determined that it needs further time to review legal provisions related to accepting vaccine donations. Once India works through its legal processes, our donations of vaccines to India will proceed expeditiously. We would need to refer you to the Government of India on the status of its discussions with COVAX, which, in this case, is helping to facilitate that delivery.</p>
<p>More broadly in the region, throughout South Asia, we’re donating millions of vaccines to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Roughly 40 million doses have been delivered worldwide so far.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So the delay in shipping COVID-19 vaccines to India is because of some regulations that India has to clear that, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I would need to refer you to the Indian Government for their processes and where they are internally. But we are ready to ship those vaccines expeditiously when we have a greenlight from the Government of India.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But have you determined how many vaccines you are planning to ship to India?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’ve announced that. I – we can get that for you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And can you also give us a sense of cooperation between India and U.S. on COVID-19 vaccines development and production and also to the third-world countries?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> And – what was the last part of your question?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And also the third-world countries.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Absolutely. So cooperation between our two countries, it is not the product of something – of only something that was built in the context of COVID. It actually builds on decades of successful partnership between our two countries in health, in biomedical research. We are partnering to strengthen the global response to COVID-19 on issues ranging from addressing infectious disease outbreaks to strengthening health systems to securing global supply chains.</p>
<p>We recently welcomed an initiative to collaborate through the International Center of Excellence in Research focused on infectious diseases, and in this case that includes COVID-19 and other emerging threats. And we look forward to an overarching MOU, a memorandum of understanding, to enhance health cooperation beyond that.</p>
<p>We are further working on diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines to combat the disease and to recognize the importance of manufacturing critical drugs during this time and to making them accessible globally. And we’re able to do that because India’s pharmaceutical sector is strong, it’s well-established, it has played a central role in manufacturing vaccines for global use over some time. And we’re pleased that U.S. pharmaceutical companies in turn are coordinating with their Indian counterparts since the beginning of the pandemic. As you know, beyond this partnership, in the context of the Quad leader’s summit, there was an agreement to work with India to boost manufacturing of COVID vaccines that would support a safe and effective and eventually universal distribution of vaccines around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> One final one. The situation – the pandemic situation in India has improved quite considerably in the last few weeks. The U.S. had imposed some travel restrictions on people coming from India. Now the situation is improving. Are you reviewing it and when do you think this will be lifted?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I would say there are a couple of things at play here. When it comes to the travel restrictions, as you know, that is something that we are taking a close look at – the U.S. Government, I should say, is taking a close look at. There are expert groups that have been formed. And “experts” in this case refers primarily to medical professionals, because for us this is not a decision about politics; this is a decision about public health and the safety of the American people but also the safety of the global traveling public. And we want to make sure that this decision is adjudicated with that central principle in mind.</p>
<p>The State Department, for our part, we also routinely issue travel advisories and we routinely update them for all countries based on a comprehensive review of available safety information and ongoing developments. We review those regularly and we make updates as warranted.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Thank you. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Ned, very much. I have a follow-up on Cuba, but first I want to ask two questions on Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-brazil"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Brazilian president wants to change next election process back to a paper vote. He has alleged that fraud in previous election, without giving evidence, and last week he threatened to cancel next election next year if there is not a clean one. So what is the administration reaction, response to these claims? And does the U.S. have confidence that the previous past elections in Brazil were fair, and the next one will also be fair?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What we call for – and this is not unique to Brazil, but it’s what we call for around the world – are free and fair elections, the ability of the people to exercise their will freely and fairly. And so the mechanics of an election are typically not of consequence to us. What is of consequence is the character of an election, and so we will be looking to see to it that elections around the world – but including in Brazil – are free and fair.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Are you being patient to these claims that the president is making? He is following Trump’s playbook when it comes to election fraud.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I would not want to characterize what the Brazilian president is saying, but I will characterize where we stand on the exercise of democracy, the ability of peoples around the world to exercise their free will, and that’s free and fair elections in our view are important. They are important in democracies; they are important in aspiring democracies. They are a key metric as we determine the health of democracies and the health of participatory electoral systems around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And another one, because harassment against journalists also in Brazil has increased since President Bolsonaro took office. Last week the organization Reporters Without Borders included Bolsonaro on a list of press predators, alongside 37 authoritarian leaders like Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin. And also last week president’s lawyer sent a message to a female reporter saying that in China, she would be – she would disappear and her body would not be found. So what is – is this kind of threat is something that worries this administration, coming from Bolsonaro’s government?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, generally the department is always concerned when journalists face threats of harassment, face threats of intimidation, and especially when there are threats of violence. We already spoke of one especially tragic case during the course of this briefing. Freedom of the press, freedom of expression more broadly, is something we support around the world. In order to have freedom of the press, freedom of expression, you have to stand up for the safety and security of journalists and reporters around the world. So I haven’t taken a close look at the study you mentioned, but we certainly have seen, broadly speaking, an uptick in threats of intimidation, threats of violence of reporters globally.</p>
<p>As you know, the Secretary, just in advance of World Press Freedom Day, in May of this year, hosted a group of journalists, many of whom have faced intimidation, threats of violence in their own work. And we did that very purposefully, to put a spotlight on this challenge. And it’s a challenge that not only comes from governments; sometimes nongovernmental organizations and actors, terrorist groups, and others take part in this. But journalists should never face threats, face danger in the course of their work for what it is they may report, for what it is they may uncover.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Would these violations of human rights impact the bilateral relationship between Brazil and the U.S., since you are saying this administration put human rights at the center of foreign policy?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, that’s exactly the point. And it’s not unique to Brazil; it’s not unique to any one country. But in every relationship we have – this includes with our closest partners; it includes those with whom we may have profound disagreements – we are always going to be taking a close look at a country’s human rights record to seek improvement where we can, but ultimately to see to it that people around the world are protected in exercising their universal rights, their universal freedoms. The United States will always be a voice for that. Oftentimes we do make that point publicly, but in private conversations as well we don’t shy away, and we do what we can in our assessment as – in the means most effective for us to protect and to safeguard human rights around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just – can I do a very quick follow-up on Cuba?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-cuba3"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Because during the campaign, President Biden said that Trump’s reversals on Cuba policy have inflicted harm to the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights. So does President Biden still want to change Trump’s policy on Cuba? And when would be a good time, if not now?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we are undertaking a review of our – of a Cuba policy precisely to determine how best we can support the human rights of Cubans, how best we can support the prospect for democracy on the island. Now, of course, successive administrations have sought in some ways to do that, and so as I said before, we are going to be taking a close look at what has and has not worked in the past, and unfortunately, in the case of Cuba there may be more that has not worked than what has worked. And so we are going to be, as we’ve done in other cases as well, studying that very closely to determine what we can do most effectively, consistent with our values, consistent with our interests, to move the ball forward, especially when it comes to democracy and human rights.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Will Cuba become a priority now, after the events on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, of course, you heard from the President directly, you heard from the Secretary directly standing right here. We have not been shy about speaking to what is going on. Of course, it’s always a priority for us when citizens are taking to the streets peacefully to express their aspirations for democracy and human rights. We’ll continue to watch this very closely.</p>
<p>Yes, Rich.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I want to stay in the hemisphere.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’ll – in the hemisphere? Were you staying in the hemisphere?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I was going to go to a different hemisphere.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, let’s stay in the hemisphere. I’ll come right back to you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Go ahead.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-haiti"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So in Haiti – is the U.S. team in Haiti assisting the assassination investigation part of a U.S. foreign emergency support team? Do you know who from this building was part of the U.S. delegation went to Haiti on Sunday? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Right. So there was an interagency delegation that was in Haiti on Sunday. DAS Lochman from our Western Hemisphere Affairs Bureau represented the department in discussions on Sunday. The team was deployed in order to take part in an assessment of how best the United States can support the Haitian people as they respond to this. Right now we’re focusing on that investigation, what we might be able to do to support the Haitian investigation into the assassination of President Moise.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is anyone from the FEST, the foreign emergency support team, there?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I – we’ll get back to you on that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Uh-huh. And what is the U.S. message to Haitian people standing outside of U.S. embassy, asking for political asylum?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I understand that the situation in front of our Embassy in Port-au-Prince is now calm. The groups that were gathered there, I understand, have dissipated. As we do around the world, we encourage Haitians, in this case, not to gather in front of our embassy. For their own safety, for their own security, we continue to urge calm across the – across Haiti. We have heard Acting Prime Minister Joseph make very similar calls, other political actors make similar calls, calling for calm. We reiterate those. That is precisely what Haiti needs, as Haiti’s political actors, we hope, will work together in the interests of the Haitian people to make meaningful progress in efforts to form a consensus government that can lead to free and fair elections.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So have the Haitians made any requests that you guys have said no to?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Right now we are evaluating a number of requests. We are evaluating how best we can support the needs of the Haitian Government at the moment. As I said right now, much of that focuses on the ongoing investigation into the killing of President Moise. In addition to the interagency team, the FBI and DHS have been engaged on the ground as well to determine the investigative assets, investigative support that Haiti may need on its investigation.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So does that mean the answer is no, you haven’t denied any requests, at least yet?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’re still evaluating. I don’t believe we &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, fine. But have you said no to anything?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. I don’t believe we have denied any requests right yet, but we’re still evaluating quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one follow-up &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But as you said yesterday, the focus is on the investigation rather than security assistance, which was a request. So is there a response to that request?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, as I think you’ve heard from the Pentagon and from the White House, we are evaluating requests for assistance, just as we would requests from assistance in other contexts. We know in this case that there may be needs for protection in the context of critical infrastructure. We’re taking a close look at that as well. FBI and DHS, as I said before, have been engaging with their Haitian counterparts, but all of these requests we’re evaluating in line with our assessment of how we can best assist the Haitian people and the Haitian Government.</p>

<p><a id="post-258775-olympics"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks, Ned. The European Parliament has voted for a diplomatic boycott of the upcoming Winter Olympics. Does the U.S. support that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Do we support their &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> They’re boycotting. Would – is the U.S. considering or will the U.S. follow suit and do the same?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we are – what is true is that we are closely consulting with allies and partners, as well as other actors, including the business community, to identify common concerns and, ideally, to establish a common approach regarding the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games. We’ll continue to speak out consistently in the meantime, and again, jointly with allies and partners when it comes to what we’re seeing from PRC officials. And we’ll continue to impose costs and sanctions on those responsible for human rights abuses, including the state sponsorship of forced labor. And just today, as I said at the outset of the briefing, you saw the updated business advisory that came from the Department of State and several of our interagency partners. But right now, we are engaged in discussions to establish those common concerns, and I don’t have anything for you beyond that.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-china2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did the U.S. – as you – as the U.S. engages with its allies on this decision-making process, did the European Union or those countries engage? Was that – their decision the result of consultations with the United States?</p>
<p>And then sort of separately on your talking about the business community and today’s advisory, can you confirm that we can expect one on Hong Kong? And the Xinjiang advisory is about three dozen pages. Succinctly, what is the message to the business community? That this type of activity, knowingly having forced labor in your supply chains, is immoral – which it is, clearly, in the statement – or is it illegal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I think what we said in – at the outset is that companies that engage with entities and who are enmeshed in supply chains in Xinjiang do face potential legal exposure. And the business advisory was quite clear on that.</p>
<p>When it comes to the EU and how they arrived at this decision, I’m not going to speak for the EU. I will let them speak for themselves. I will say that the EU, of course, is an important partner when it comes to any number of issues, and that in part is predicated on our shared values. And I would make the broader point that you have seen a great deal of convergence between the United States and our European allies on – based on those values in the context of the PRC and Xinjiang in particular. Let me give you just a few examples.</p>
<p>At the G7 summit, President Biden and Chancellor Merkel outlined our shared positions on China. The President had an opportunity to meet with a number of his other counterparts, including British Prime Minister Johnson and others, to discuss the importance of coordinating and responding to China’s non-market practices and the need to speak out on human rights abuses, including in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. The communique that resulted from the G7 summit also addressed the need for action against forced labor practices in the agricultural, solar, and garment sectors. There was an entire paragraph – paragraph 49, I belive it was – dedicated to this issue and showcasing the convergence.</p>
<p>At the NATO summit, the communique for the first time ever addressed the security challenges from China. And the United States and our NATO Allies, many of whom are European, of course, agreed to draft a new strategic concept, a framework that will guide the Alliance’s approach to the evolving strategic environment in the coming years – not only to address Russia’s aggressive actions, but also those posed by the PRC to our collective security.</p>
<p>And then, of course, at the U.S.-EU summit the leaders launched the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, the goal – whose goal is to write the rules of the road for the economy of the 21st century in areas like emerging technology and competition policy. And we’ve also put forward a series of affirmative ideas, Build Back Better World being at the center of this, offering and making clear that, one, democracies can deliver; and two, there is an alternative, attractive model to what other countries may be offering here.</p>
<p>When it comes to Hong Kong, we don’t have anything to announce at this time regarding future policy moves. You’ve heard from us on any number of occasions our concern regarding Beijing’s ongoing attempts to undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy, to dismantle its democratic institutions and processes. We’ll continue to call international attention to and to hold PRC and Hong Kong authorities accountable for the erosion of the rule of law in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>I would make one additional broader point here. We know that a healthy business community relies on the rule of law, which the national security law that applies to Hong Kong continues to undermine. As a general matter, we seek to ensure that businesses can operate in a stable, predictable, and fair regulatory environments around the world. And rule of law risks that were formerly limited to mainland China are now increasingly a concern in Hong Kong. That’s of great concern to us. It is of great concern to the American business community. It’s of great concern to the international business community.</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-haiti2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On Cuba – just because you’re on Cuba – my colleague asked about the urgency of this ongoing policy review. Is there a timeline for completion? I think we’ve continued to ask, and obviously the protests sort of lend a greater immediacy to the question.</p>
<p>And then on Haiti, are you – is the administration particularly concerned about instability in the country as a result of this dispute over control of the government? And is the State Department or the interagency going to continue to engage with all of the claimants to power?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we have engaged with a wide variety of stakeholders in Haiti. The interagency delegation that was there over the weekend met with Claude Joseph, Ariel Henry, Joseph Lambert, and others. And we have continued to urge these political actors to work together in the interests of the Haitian people.</p>
<p>We have called on Haitian political leaders, the Haitian private sector, civil society to come together to – importantly, to strengthen the democratic institutions and to reach an inclusive solution that will facilitate peace and stability and lead to presidential and legislative elections.</p>
<p>For us, this is about – the guiding principles are Haiti’s constitution, its institutions, and we have urged Haitian political actors to work together in the interests of their people to make meaningful progress in that effort to form a consensus government that ultimately can lead to free and fair elections. And of course, the Haitian constitution calls for those free and fair elections later this year.</p>
<p>Beyond this immediate political situation, Haiti’s political gridlock has long taken a great toll on the country, and it’s vital for Haiti’s leaders to finally come together to chart a united path for the country. The United States will continue to be a partner to the Haitian people. We will continue to engage constructively with Haiti’s political actors and its broader set of stakeholders to do what we can to help support Haiti’s political leaders finding this consensus solution.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-cuba4"></a> On the Cuba policy review, of course, we are moving as expeditiously as appropriate in this case. We are making sure that we are consulting with, as I said before, a broad and wide variety of stakeholders. We are taking a close look at what the United States can best do to support the needs of the Cuban people, to support their legitimate and long-denied aspirations for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p>Shaun.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-egypt"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I ask about Egypt?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> There was a report yesterday in Politico that Mohamed Soltan, whose case I’m sure you’re familiar with, that there was an agreement by the State Department under the previous administration, at least something signed, to the effect that he would be again in custody of the United States and that Egypt’s intelligence chief has raised that again.</p>
<p>First of all, is there any truth to the – to that initial finding that there was some document there? Was this raised? And do you have any comment overall on his situation now?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we’re aware of the document that was reported related to Mohamed Soltan, of course, a U.S. citizen. He was formerly imprisoned in Egypt. We don’t have a comment on its legal authority.</p>
<p>What I would remind you, though, is what we said at the time: The United States condemned the detention of Mr. Soltan and we called for his immediate release. It’s something that we worked for very assiduously.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Could you say whether the Egyptians have raised this again?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’m not in a position to detail that.</p>
<p>Lara.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-iran"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Staying in that region, if we could go to Iran. There is a report out of Tehran today that a government spokesman said that Iran and the United States are negotiating for prisoners exchanges.</p>
<p>First, I assume that was not a direct negotiation, but if it was, could you please comment?</p>
<p>And then secondly, this seems like a good opportunity to ask about the status of the talks and what effort is being made to break the current stalemate, or hold, or logjam, or whatever we want to call it.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, first on the question of detainees, you are correct; it is indirect but active discussions taking place on this – to this end, seeing the release of the Americans who have been unjustly detained, deprived of their freedom for far too long now. We are treating the issue of detainees independently from discussions of the JCPOA, as you know. It&#8217;s really a matter of us to see to it that these detainees are released as soon as possible. We are working with the utmost urgency and we want it to be resolved immediately. We&#8217;re working night and day to bring these detainees, these American citizens home. We&#8217;re also working with our allies, many of whom also have citizens currently arbitrarily or wrongfully detained by the Iranian Government.</p>
<p>Look, the broader point is that Iran&#8217;s unjust imprisonment of U.S. citizens for use as political leverage, it&#8217;s abhorrent, it&#8217;s outrageous. Our priority is bringing these individuals home as possible and resolving the cases of missing and abducted U.S. citizens just as quickly as we can.</p>
<p>When it comes to the status of the talks, we&#8217;ve discussed this yesterday, but questions about when or whether Iran would be prepared to start a seventh round of talks or to reach an understanding on a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA, those questions have to be addressed to Tehran. They can&#8217;t be addressed to us. As we&#8217;ve made clear, we are prepared to continue engaging in the context of these indirect negotiations with Iran. We&#8217;re prepared to return to a seventh round of talks. We&#8217;ve been equally clear that there&#8217;s not a deadline, a firm deadline that we have in mind as of right now, but we&#8217;ve made no secret of the fact that we are considering the implications of Iran’s nuclear advances for a potential return to the JCPOA. So we&#8217;re watching very closely.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Great. Ned, just on the indirect, active – indirect but active discussions on the – is there anything new about this today other than the fact that an Iranian official said this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Anything new over the course of the last couple months? We&#8217;ve known about these talks for some time. They&#8217;ve been going on, yes, separately from the nuclear talks, but still they&#8217;ve been going on. And I think that senior officials who we all know has talked about it pretty openly.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I – correct me, Lara, if I&#8217;m wrong, but I think Lara asked a question just based on what an Iranian official said.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No, no, no, I know. But I&#8217;m wondering, it&#8217;s – I’m not saying it&#8217;s not a valid question. I just wonder if there&#8217;s anything new today that was not new last week or the week before or the month – a month before or two months or three months.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Matt, I think we have found in the cases – in the case of Americans who are held against their will unjustly around the world that these discussions are best undertaken quietly, and we often don&#8217;t speak to the details from the podium precisely because we are doing everything we can and working as urgently as we can to secure their release. I&#8217;m just not in a position to update on where these indirect discussions may be.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, yeah, but they&#8217;ve been going on for months, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, they&#8217;ve been going on before this administration took office. I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>That’s – yes, I mean – okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-indopacificasean"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah, thank you, Ned. Two questions, please. First, on the Secretary&#8217;s ASEAN foreign ministers meeting later this evening, last week Kurt Campbell spoke at an event where he said I think we have been “missing in action” in many respects in the Pacific. He said we recognize fully that for an effective Asia strategy you must do more in Southeast Asia. And he said we want in the next little while to step up our game substantially.</p>
<p>So first, would the State Department agree that the U.S. has been missing in action in the Pacific? And will the Secretary&#8217;s message today be about greater U.S. engagement in Southeast Asia? And then I have a follow-up on China.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So this is a region, the Indo-Pacific, that is vitally important to us for any number of interests, but also our values. I think what the Secretary will say tonight – and I expect we&#8217;ll have a readout after the session concludes – is a reaffirmation of our commitment to ASEAN’s centrality and a reaffirmation of ASEAN’s central and essential role in the Indo-Pacific’s regional architecture. The Secretary will have the first opportunity tonight to speak to ASEAN – at least to the foreign ministers – as a whole, but as you know, we did meet with the Bruneian foreign minister in London, current chair of ASEAN; the Secretary has been in contact bilaterally with – over the phone and in person with a number of ASEAN members. Deputy Secretary Sherman was – traveled to the region several weeks ago, where she met with ASEAN counterparts.</p>
<p>So I think both in terms of word and deed, we have demonstrated our commitment to the centrality of ASEAN. We know of its indispensable and central role to the regional architecture. But I wouldn’t want to get ahead of the Secretary’s engagement tonight.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-china3"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And then – excuse me – on China, China’s Foreign Ministry has responded to yesterday’s atrocities report, and they’ve said that the U.S. is no position to point fingers at other countries’ human rights situation. They gave examples of past treatment of Native Americans, I think they brought up George Floyd, and they called the report a waste of paper. Do you have any response to that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have a response to that. I will just say, without commenting on what sounds like the PRC playbook, that we have been very clear that as part of our commitment to human rights – our defense, our promotion of human rights around the world – that as a confident democracy, as a country that is comfortable and confident in its standing, we can be open, we can be transparent about where we have veered off course, where we have not met the ideals that – towards which we strive every day. After all, and as we often like to point out, this country was not born a perfect union. It is our essential mission every day to form a more perfect union.</p>
<p>Where that imperfection has been on display, at least speaking for this administration, we have not sought to sweep it under the rug, we’ve not sought to hide it from the rest of the world. We know that for the health, for the wellbeing of our own democracy, it’s important that we are open and transparent but also to be the model that we aspire to be for other democracies and aspiring democracies around the world. We set an important example by comporting ourselves in that.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, everyone. Very quick? Very – yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-258775-russiaclimate"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Quickly, Special Envoy John Kerry’s meeting in Russia, because it was reported by media reports that the U.S. is trying to setting up some proposal to work with Russia on climate change. Do you have any readout on his meetings in Russia?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have a readout at the moment. I do expect that the special envoy’s office will be in a position to provide additional details at the conclusion of his meetings there. Of course, it is not a secret that we have profound differences with the Russian Federation on any number of issues, and I need not go into them. But it’s also not a secret – and you saw this in the form of President Biden meeting with President Putin – that we believe there are going to be certain areas where our interests align. And you saw that in the context of an agreement last week announced to extend the Syrian humanitarian corridor by 12 months; you see that in – you saw that in the renewal of the New START agreement for five years in the first days of this administration; and Secretary Kerry at the moment is testing the proposition as to whether we can work together on the global and existential challenge of climate change. Russia is one of the world’s most prolific emitters, and so Russia has a responsibility, as does the United States, to be ambitious in its climate targets.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I – so do you expect Secretary Kerry to go to Brazil as well this year before the summit?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have any forthcoming travel to announce. I would have to refer you to his office for that.</p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 3:13 p.m.)</p>
