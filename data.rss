					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><em>“President Macron and I stand together, ready to take on the toughest challenges we face.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><em>– President Biden, June 11, 2021</em></p>
<p>Secretary Antony J. Blinken will travel to Paris, France, June 24-27, 2021, where he will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and French Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian.  During this trip to engage with the United States’ oldest Ally, Secretary Blinken will emphasize the importance of maintaining Transatlantic cooperation, addressing our joint response to the ongoing health crisis, tackling the climate crisis, and highlighting the strength of our longstanding bilateral partnership.</p>
<p><strong>The United States and France are Close Allies</strong></p>
<p>France is America’s oldest friend and Ally.  Our relationship is built upon our shared commitment to the same values – democracy, human rights, the rule of law, security, and prosperity.  The closeness of our military, economic, and political cooperation form the basis of our enduring partnership.</p>
<p>The United States has counted on France as a close partner since the very foundation of our country.  We remember Gilbert du Mortier, Marquis de Lafayette, and Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, Comte de Rochambeau, as heroes of the American Revolution.  France came to the aid of our young country; the United States has not forgotten.</p>
<p>In 2021, we commemorated the 77th anniversary of D-Day and the sacrifices made on the beaches of Normandy.  As NATO Allies, France and the United States have built and sustained the post-war global order, which promotes freedom and prosperity.  Our joint commitment to shared Transatlantic values has brought us 77 years of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p><strong>Confronting Global Challenges: The United States Counts on France as a Partner</strong></p>
<p>Today’s global challenges underscore the importance of strong partnerships.  Security, economic, and cultural cooperation form the basis of our bilateral relationship.  France is a key NATO Ally and an important bilateral economic partner.  France will assume the presidency of the Council of the European Union in January 2022, and we look forward to working with France to revitalize and raise the level of ambition in the United States’ partnership with the EU.</p>
<p>Security cooperation underpins our bilateral relationship.  France remains a steadfast partner in the fight against terrorism, as both a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and through its counterterrorism leadership in the Sahel.  Around the world, we look to France as a partner in global security.</p>
<p>The United States and France agree on the need to hold Russia accountable for its aggressive and destabilizing activities, including in Ukraine.  France is a partner in standing up to Russia’s attempts to undermine democratic systems.</p>
<p>We coordinate with France on issues like human rights, economic coercion, and corruption, to amplify our voices and combat the PRC’s attempts to erode the values and institutions that undergird the rules-based international order.</p>
<p>The United States is dedicated to raising global climate ambitions. In the lead up to COP26, we will continue to work with France in implementing climate finance to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century.</p>
<p><strong>The Thriving Bilateral Economic Relationship Supports Our Workers</strong></p>
<p>The United States and France share a deep trade and investment relationship.  France is the United States’ third largest trading partner in Europe with $99.7 billion of goods and services traded in 2020.  The United States is the top destination for French investment and the United States is the largest foreign investor in France.  In total, we have invested more than $394 billion in each other&#8217;s economies.  The 4,800 French firms in the United States support 780,000 jobs, while the 4,500 U.S. firms in France support nearly 500,000 jobs.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the United States and France share concerns about the health of our citizens as we seek to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and ensure equitable access to vaccines.  The United States and France have both committed to share vaccine doses through COVAX and will continue to support global vaccination efforts.  We must work together to safely restore global travel and trade on a sustainable basis, and the United States looks forward to partnering with France to increase global preparedness to better prevent and respond to future outbreaks.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Historical and Cultural Ties Cement Our People-to-People Bonds </strong></p>
<p>The enduring relationship between our two countries is apparent in our historical connection and people-to-people ties.  France and the United States share a strong commitment to educational exchanges.  Before the coronavirus pandemic, approximately18,000 Americans studied abroad in France each year, making France among the top four most popular study abroad destinations for American students.  French students are also attracted to educational exchange opportunities in the United States.  In the 2019/2020 academic year, 8,471 French students chose to study at a U.S. college or university.   Although COVID-19 has forced many of our exchange programs to pause this year, interest in exchanges remains strong, and we will make every effort to ensure that these exchanges between our two countries not only continue but grow.</p>
<p>Established in 1948, the U.S.-French Fulbright program is one of the oldest Fulbright programs in the world.  Every year, approximately 160 French and American students, scholars, teaching assistants, and higher education administrators receive Fulbright awards to study, teach, and conduct research.  Since its inception, the program has supported approximately 30,000 individual Fulbright exchanges between the United States and France and will celebrate its 75th anniversary in 2023.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>I would like to congratulate law professor Gay McDougall on her election as an independent expert to serve on the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).  Advancing racial equity and justice is a top priority for the United States, and in our pursuit of those ideals at home and around the world, the United States was proud to nominate her to serve a third term on the Committee.</p>
<p>The Committee is an important UN platform for addressing global systemic racism.  It is charged with the critical work of monitoring 182 States parties’ compliance with their treaty obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).  The United States takes our ICERD treaty obligations seriously and submitted our outstanding reports to the CERD Committee on June 2.</p>
<p>Professor McDougall is a globally acclaimed expert in international human rights law, a Fordham University law professor, and will serve as a principled and independent voice on the Committee.  She has successfully served on this Committee in the past, and I am confident she will continue to bring the important perspective of American jurisprudence towards the goal of eliminating global and systemic racism.</p>

<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Welcome, everyone, for our session today on the transatlantic relations.  I’m very happy that Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Maas could join us today.</p>
<p>Again, in German.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) So first of all, I’d like to say, first of all, thank you and a very, very warm welcome to all of you.  I’m so happy that first, Foreign Minister Maas, and also Secretary of State Blinken are here.  It’s great that we have the opportunity to speak with them.  I’d like to give them the chance to speak.</p>
<p>Mr. Minister Maas, you have three minutes for brief remarks for – on German foreign policy and transatlantic relations.  Three minutes, they belong to you, and then we will pass the baton onto Secretary of State Blinken.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter) A word of welcome also on my behalf.  We are delighted to have the opportunity to not only talk to those people we tend to meet regularly – ministers, politicians – but to meet with people like you.  We are dying to hear your questions.  Please be courageous.  We are willing to take any questions you might have.  I really enjoy something like this, especially as the perspective of us being given a glass of beer is there visible on the horizon.  Why are you giving me a large one?  (Laughter.)  Bad news, bad press coverage.  And that this takes place in a location like this – those who know Berlin know Clarchens Ballhaus, and I am pleased that Tony accepted to have this here.  This is not the classical Berlin style.</p>
<p>So as I said, we look forward to having your questions.  And I don’t want to be too long.  I’ll just share a story with you, if I may, Tony.  From the very first telephone conversation we had after Tony took the office of Secretary of State, at the end of the telephone call I couldn’t help myself by saying Tony, I still have to get used to the fact that I can speak to the American Foreign Secretary and always be of the same view because that used to be different beforehand.</p>
<p>This is important for the bilateral relationship between Germany and the United States.  The election of Joe Biden is a genuine game-changer for international politics, the biggest for quite a while – for many years indeed as long as I have been following events in the field of foreign policy because you once said diplomacy is back, and I think the President also said that diplomacy is back, the United States are back on the international stage.  And that is really something that we missed for quite a while – transatlantic partnership, yes, indeed.</p>
<p>I think we have to have the same objectives, and that has improved as far as that situation is concerned.  And I think this is to do with the fact that we are linked by the same values.  We share the same values: democracy, freedom, rule of law.  And I believe that that is what the vast majority of the people on this globe actually wants to have as the foundation of their lives, and that is what links us.  I think that is what brings us together and what we have in common, Europe and North America.  And the times we are experiencing is the place to be.</p>
<p>Okay, let me give you one example, a somewhat problematic one.  When we look to the flows of migration we are confronted with, the people who want to come to Europe, why do they want to come to Europe?  I know about few people – migrants who are heading in the direction of China or Moscow.  They’re coming to us.  And the same is true for the United States when you look to Latin America – South America – they are heading in your direction, your way, and towards Canada.  And that is a clear indication of the fact that this is what the people are looking for: democracy, liberal societies, freedoms, and respect for the rights of minorities too.  These are the values that we share.</p>
<p>And if you share that set of values, it’s not that difficult also to define the same objectives.  And it is now about how we can cooperate in order to achieve these objectives.  And we are cooperating.  In the past, this hasn’t been the case often enough when you look to Russia and to China.  We won’t be able to achieve as much as we would if the United States and Europe were to pursue the same strategy; we would be playing in the same camp, so to speak.  And that is or has become obvious over the last few months – the same objectives, the same set of values.</p>
<p>And every – whenever this cooperation takes place, G7, G20, we are heading for a G20 ministerial meeting at the end of – at the beginning of next week – we’ll have to unite our forces in order to protect what is important to us, the values that – our foundation and our political sphere, but also those that we want to have as a foundation for our everyday life.  They need to be protected and to be upheld day in, day out.  And if that is possible, I think then it should be possible also to make sure that they are upheld in other parts of the world too.</p>
<p>So as I said, I’m delighted that we’re back here.  We need the United States.  And yeah, I want to be quite open because it sounds so political what I’ve been saying so far.  It’s more fun too.  I’m being very honest.  We had President Trump, then we had the virus.  It has made matters extremely complicated.  I now hope that we will overcome the virus too.  We have so many things in common.  And I think there is such a great degree of readiness and willingness on both sides of the Atlantic to cooperate.  So I look forward to that.</p>
<p>Minister, thank you very much indeed.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Welcome to Berlin, the transatlantic relations and the focus today.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, first, it’s wonderful to be with all of you.  And I’ve got to say, Heiko, as much as I love the foreign ministry and as much as the chancellor’s office is extraordinary, this is a pretty good place to have a conversation.  And I asked for the smaller one.  They were going to give me a larger one, but cheers, first of all.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  A couple of things.  First of all, it’s wonderful to see all of you, and I’m really looking forward to hearing from you and talking to you.  I have a deep personal affection for Germany that goes back many years.  I had the great experience and good fortune after being born in New York and living in New York until I was nine years old and moving when I was nine to Paris, and my closest friends in school in Paris were both, as it turned out, German – both when I first got there when I was nine, ten years old, and then later another good friend who was my closest friend through high school.  And we were in a band together.  He was actually talented, unlike me.  (Laughter.)  But we – one spring break we took a road trip, and we drove from Paris to Hamburg, and we – maybe we thought we were going to be like the Beatles when they spent time in Hamburg and then they got famous afterward.  That didn’t happen.</p>
<p>But I have wonderful memories of getting to Hamburg.  And it was a holiday weekend, and we were at a place not unlike this in Hamburg, and the band that was supposed to play that weekend was unable to do it, and it was a holiday weekend.  And my friend said, well, we’re a band, and they said oh, all right, come back tomorrow and play a few songs, and if you’re even – if you’re any good, we’ll let you play over the holiday weekend.  And we had another member of the band with us on this road trip, and we met up with a couple of my German friends – his name was Carsten Gerlach – Carsten’s friends who lived – were still living in Hamburg, who were actually very good musicians.  We practiced all morning, went to the bar at night, the late afternoon, played a few songs.  They said, well, not great but it’s better than having no band.  (Laughter.)  And we played for the – we played all of the shows for the weekend.  I think we were underage, but don’t tell anyone.  (Laughter.)  Anyway, I have extremely warm and strong and long memories of being in Germany and having very close friends.</p>
<p>But I want to pick up where Heiko left off, because as in so many things, we’re in violent agreement.  We have such powerful connections between our countries – the work that our – the governments are doing together, but in a sense even more important, just the connections between our people.  So many generations of Americans who have German ancestry; student-to-student, young people-to-young people exchanges that most of you are involved with; our scientists, including on COVID and bio and tech, for example, working together; businesses.  It’s powerful and it’s deep.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure in my small way that that endures and maybe even grows stronger.  And there are a number of important reasons for that, but it’s really what Heiko was saying that’s most important:  When you think about the problems that we have to deal with, the challenges that we face that are actually having an impact on our lives, your lives, my life, the life of our fellow citizens, whether it’s this pandemic, whether it’s climate change, whether it’s the way new technologies are changing our lives, whether it’s migration, I think the one thing we strongly agree on and believe together is that there’s not a single one of those big things that are having an impact that any one country can effectively deal with alone.  And there is no wall high enough or wide enough to prevent some of the problems that result.</p>
<p>So I think almost more than any time in my life, there is an imperative, a need, for countries to cooperate, to work together.  And the natural thing is when you have the same basic values, that brings you together in cooperation, but it doesn’t just happen; you have to work at it.  And we have – and sometimes we have differences of approach, tactics, et cetera, but the fundamentals are very, very strong.  And I think what so many of you are doing, especially in creating experiences, creating friendships, creating networks even with Americans, with Germans, these kinds of connections are exactly the way going forward we’re going to find ways to cooperate and deal together with the challenges that we face.</p>
<p>We both know that our responsibility in whatever way we can is to try to demonstrate that our countries, our democracies – that’s what joins us in terms of values – that we can actually produce results that – whether it’s a problem or an opportunity, we can help address it.  If we can’t do that, we are not going to have a lot of confidence of the people that we represent.  If we can do that, that’s how you make progress.  And you are all very much a part of that idea.  This can’t happen without the connections that you’re making, without the – I think the – hopefully the cooperation and work that you’ll do with people, not just United States and Germany, but across Europe and across the world.  It’s never been more important, and so I’m really glad to have this opportunity to exchange some ideas and to hear from you what you’re thinking about, what concerns you, because we have to be able to meet the things that are shaping your lives, that you care about, that you see as having an impact for good or for bad on your futures.  That’s our responsibility, but we need to know that we’re actually focused on the right thing.</p>
<p>And it’s – we talked about having an event with young people, and I said, “Oh, I don’t feel that old.”  (Laughter.)  But it really does make a big, big difference because – I won’t speak for Heiko, but you get to a certain age, and as much as you try to have an open mind, you can get set in your ways, in your viewpoint, in the way you approach things.  And it’s so important for me, for us, to hear from people from different backgrounds, different experiences, different generations.  So thank you for being here today.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>U.S. Embassy Berlin</p>
<p><strong>MS QUINVILLE:    </strong>Mr. Secretary, here and virtually, you have the community of mighty Mission Germany.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>All right.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS QUINVILLE:  </strong>This is our embassy and five consulates in Hamburg, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, and Leipzig.  We are 1,700 strong.  We are Americans from across our government.  We are Germans and folks from around the world who are resident here in Berlin and elsewhere in Germany.  We are creative, committed, energetic, and flexible.  In a crisis, we bend but never break.</p>
<p>When COVID hit, we knew it was going to define us as a community, so we were generous with each other.  We shifted to a mix of home office and in-office work with remarkable grace.  We accidentally met families and pets during our Zoom meetings, and we forgave each other our worst hair days.  For the 16 months of sometimes-tough-to-take lockdown, we have stood six feet apart and still supported each other.  And you will not find a better team to power our policy.  So I am proud to be part of this extraordinary group.</p>
<p>Now, for mighty Mission Germany, please welcome Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you all so very, very much.  Robin, I think you&#8217;ve summed it up better than I could.  I&#8217;ve heard about mighty Mission Germany.  Now I get to see mighty Mission Germany here on the screen, and to hear it also in your words.  I am so grateful to have everyone or have so many of you together in this room, to get to meet face to face or maybe mask to mask, depending.</p>
<p>And I just can&#8217;t begin to tell you how proud I am of the work that you&#8217;ve been doing, the way that you&#8217;ve been doing it in a time of tremendous, tremendous challenge.  And to your point, Robin, I think what we&#8217;ve seen here – and I&#8217;ve got to tell you, what we&#8217;ve seen in our missions around the world that I&#8217;ve had the privilege in these past couple of months to visit – we have seen exactly what you described, which is our teams, our people coming together, and six feet apart but standing together, continuing the work that you’re entrusted with.  And I am truly grateful for that.</p>
<p>There are few more important places to be doing that then right here in Germany.  I said yesterday that it&#8217;s hard to think of a better friend or a stronger partner to the United States.  And we need those strong partners and those good friends.  Everything that we&#8217;re doing on behalf of our fellow citizens back home, the challenges that they face, the things that are going to have a real impact on their lives, we can&#8217;t do it alone, certainly not as effectively.</p>
<p>And whether it&#8217;s the big issues of our time like dealing with this pandemic, climate change, disruptive impact of technology, to smaller day-in/day-out things, we know that even the United States can&#8217;t get the job done alone, that we benefit profoundly from working in coordination and cooperation with others.  And to me, it&#8217;s a tremendous sense of strength and comfort to know that we have such a strong, committed partner in Germany.  And that partnership, the day-in/day-out work of making it strong, building it, keeping it resilient – that&#8217;s exactly what all of you, each and every one of you, is doing every single day.  And I couldn&#8217;t be more grateful for that.</p>
<p>We had a short but very, very good visit here in these last 24-plus hours, including a very, very productive meeting with Chancellor Merkel that I&#8217;m grateful for, a lot of time with my friend and a wonderful person, Heiko Maas, the foreign minister.  You all saw that we took part of the important conference that Germany brought together on Libya and its future.  And just now, just across the street, we launched the U.S.-Germany Dialogue on Holocaust Issues.  That, in just a small way, captures the incredible breadth as well as the depth of what we&#8217;re doing together.</p>
<p>Robin, I know you are heading back home in just a few days, and I just want to salute your remarkable leadership these last 16 months at this mission.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  With your very dynamic DCM, I think you&#8217;ve demonstrated what an incredibly powerful duo can do and get done with the remarkable team here at Mission Germany.</p>
<p>I do want to spend one more second just on the resilience that all of you showed during COVID. We are getting to the end of it.  I know we’ve had – continue to have ups and downs, but we&#8217;re getting there.  But I have some feeling and understanding for what these months of lockdowns and being closed in and quarantined and other restrictions have meant.  And again, I just want to say thank you for doing, in so many different ways, big and small, what it took to keep morale high, to keep the mission going, to keep working on behalf of the American people, to take care of Americans here in Germany, just to keep the work of this mission going.</p>
<p>I heard about a couple of things that just struck me.  And, again, we&#8217;re – when we&#8217;re doing a lot of this work we sometimes are talking in terms of big high-policy issues and strategic matters of one kind or another.  But the human things have such a powerful impact too.  So the mass community outreach initiative that I heard about handmade more than a thousand cloth masks donated to hospitals, to eldercare facilities, to refugee camps, to the Ronald McDonald House.  I can&#8217;t begin to tell you how even that kind of gesture has a lasting, profound impact on people.  That&#8217;s the human connection that you&#8217;re also making every single day.</p>
<p>Now, maybe on a more challenging note, I know that you&#8217;ve waited just a little bit for the completion of the annex renovations.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>MS QUINVILLE:  </strong>Yeah.  Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>I know I’m treading on dangerous territory, but this is a major endeavor.  I think it’s demanded two things: patience and you mentioned flexibility – well, there’s another example of it, but I think well worth the wait.  New fitness facilities, basketball court, a satellite health office, beautiful community spaces – I hope, indeed, well worth the wait.</p>
<p>Let me close with this:  Whether you are a direct hire, Foreign Service Officer, civil servant; whether you&#8217;re working with one of our many partner agencies, departments; whether you&#8217;re a family member; whether you&#8217;re locally employed staff – we count on each and every one of you to keep this relationship strong, to keep it vital, to keep it going, to do the work that is so important to our fellow citizens.  And let me just say to the locally employed staff, very simply, thank you. You are the lifeblood of this mission.  You&#8217;re the lifeblood of missions everywhere around the world.  The real connectivity between our communities, you&#8217;re bringing that every single day.  I know that a number of you are here in this room.  I&#8217;m grateful to you on behalf of the United States.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve – we&#8217;re getting to the – I think the end of a challenging period.  We have lots of other challenges that we have to grapple with every single day.  When I get a chance to see each and every one of you, it gives me incredible hope.  It gives me incredible confidence, conviction that we&#8217;re going to meet the tests and challenges of our time.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>U.S. Embassy Berlin</p>
<p><strong>MS QUINVILLE:    </strong>Mr. Secretary, here and virtually, you have the community of mighty Mission Germany.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>All right.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS QUINVILLE:  </strong>This is our embassy and five consulates in Hamburg, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, and Leipzig.  We are 1,700 strong.  We are Americans from across our government.  We are Germans and folks from around the world who are resident here in Berlin and elsewhere in Germany.  We are creative, committed, energetic, and flexible.  In a crisis, we bend but never break.</p>
<p>When COVID hit, we knew it was going to define us as a community, so we were generous with each other.  We shifted to a mix of home office and in-office work with remarkable grace.  We accidentally met families and pets during our Zoom meetings, and we forgave each other our worst hair days.  For the 16 months of sometimes-tough-to-take lockdown, we have stood six feet apart and still supported each other.  And you will not find a better team to power our policy.  So I am proud to be part of this extraordinary group.</p>
<p>Now, for mighty Mission Germany, please welcome Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you all so very, very much.  Robin, I think you&#8217;ve summed it up better than I could.  I&#8217;ve heard about mighty Mission Germany.  Now I get to see mighty Mission Germany here on the screen, and to hear it also in your words.  I am so grateful to have everyone or have so many of you together in this room, to get to meet face to face or maybe mask to mask, depending.</p>
<p>And I just can&#8217;t begin to tell you how proud I am of the work that you&#8217;ve been doing, the way that you&#8217;ve been doing it in a time of tremendous, tremendous challenge.  And to your point, Robin, I think what we&#8217;ve seen here – and I&#8217;ve got to tell you, what we&#8217;ve seen in our missions around the world that I&#8217;ve had the privilege in these past couple of months to visit – we have seen exactly what you described, which is our teams, our people coming together, and six feet apart but standing together, continuing the work that you’re entrusted with.  And I am truly grateful for that.</p>
<p>There are few more important places to be doing that then right here in Germany.  I said yesterday that it&#8217;s hard to think of a better friend or a stronger partner to the United States.  And we need those strong partners and those good friends.  Everything that we&#8217;re doing on behalf of our fellow citizens back home, the challenges that they face, the things that are going to have a real impact on their lives, we can&#8217;t do it alone, certainly not as effectively.</p>
<p>And whether it&#8217;s the big issues of our time like dealing with this pandemic, climate change, disruptive impact of technology, to smaller day-in/day-out things, we know that even the United States can&#8217;t get the job done alone, that we benefit profoundly from working in coordination and cooperation with others.  And to me, it&#8217;s a tremendous sense of strength and comfort to know that we have such a strong, committed partner in Germany.  And that partnership, the day-in/day-out work of making it strong, building it, keeping it resilient – that&#8217;s exactly what all of you, each and every one of you, is doing every single day.  And I couldn&#8217;t be more grateful for that.</p>
<p>We had a short but very, very good visit here in these last 24-plus hours, including a very, very productive meeting with Chancellor Merkel that I&#8217;m grateful for, a lot of time with my friend and a wonderful person, Heiko Maas, the foreign minister.  You all saw that we took part of the important conference that Germany brought together on Libya and its future.  And just now, just across the street, we launched the U.S.-Germany Dialogue on Holocaust Issues.  That, in just a small way, captures the incredible breadth as well as the depth of what we&#8217;re doing together.</p>
<p>Robin, I know you are heading back home in just a few days, and I just want to salute your remarkable leadership these last 16 months at this mission.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  With your very dynamic DCM, I think you&#8217;ve demonstrated what an incredibly powerful duo can do and get done with the remarkable team here at Mission Germany.</p>
<p>I do want to spend one more second just on the resilience that all of you showed during COVID. We are getting to the end of it.  I know we’ve had – continue to have ups and downs, but we&#8217;re getting there.  But I have some feeling and understanding for what these months of lockdowns and being closed in and quarantined and other restrictions have meant.  And again, I just want to say thank you for doing, in so many different ways, big and small, what it took to keep morale high, to keep the mission going, to keep working on behalf of the American people, to take care of Americans here in Germany, just to keep the work of this mission going.</p>
<p>I heard about a couple of things that just struck me.  And, again, we&#8217;re – when we&#8217;re doing a lot of this work we sometimes are talking in terms of big high-policy issues and strategic matters of one kind or another.  But the human things have such a powerful impact too.  So the mass community outreach initiative that I heard about handmade more than a thousand cloth masks donated to hospitals, to eldercare facilities, to refugee camps, to the Ronald McDonald House.  I can&#8217;t begin to tell you how even that kind of gesture has a lasting, profound impact on people.  That&#8217;s the human connection that you&#8217;re also making every single day.</p>
<p>Now, maybe on a more challenging note, I know that you&#8217;ve waited just a little bit for the completion of the annex renovations.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>MS QUINVILLE:  </strong>Yeah.  Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>I know I’m treading on dangerous territory, but this is a major endeavor.  I think it’s demanded two things: patience and you mentioned flexibility – well, there’s another example of it, but I think well worth the wait.  New fitness facilities, basketball court, a satellite health office, beautiful community spaces – I hope, indeed, well worth the wait.</p>
<p>Let me close with this:  Whether you are a direct hire, Foreign Service Officer, civil servant; whether you&#8217;re working with one of our many partner agencies, departments; whether you&#8217;re a family member; whether you&#8217;re locally employed staff – we count on each and every one of you to keep this relationship strong, to keep it vital, to keep it going, to do the work that is so important to our fellow citizens.  And let me just say to the locally employed staff, very simply, thank you. You are the lifeblood of this mission.  You&#8217;re the lifeblood of missions everywhere around the world.  The real connectivity between our communities, you&#8217;re bringing that every single day.  I know that a number of you are here in this room.  I&#8217;m grateful to you on behalf of the United States.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve – we&#8217;re getting to the – I think the end of a challenging period.  We have lots of other challenges that we have to grapple with every single day.  When I get a chance to see each and every one of you, it gives me incredible hope.  It gives me incredible confidence, conviction that we&#8217;re going to meet the tests and challenges of our time.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> We wanted to do this just on background attributable to senior State Department officials to give you a sense of some of the discussions today, and we thought we would start with the Libya discussion. And  can offer a sense of how things went, the progress that was made, and what remains. So again, we’ll just do this on background.</p>
<p>And with that, I see  joining us. He will be another senior State Department official and he can obviously &#8212;</p>
<p>(Chit-chat.)</p>
<p>So let’s start with this – let’s start with this senior State Department official to talk about Libya and we’ll go from there.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Okay, hey. I think there are three things that we’re headlining out of this conference today. One is the – it’s the first appearance by a sovereign Libyan more or less united – interim united government in a long, long time, and they made their appearance on the international stage. They articulated their case, pushed for various things, and that’s already a huge step forward from where we were two years ago. So the Berlin process, which started with this summit in January of 2020, has now taken the next step with the participation of a sovereign interim Libyan Government.</p>
<p>The second headline is that – has to do with the elections. I mean, precisely, this is an interim government. Its mission is to establish – pave the way for elections on December 24th of 2021 and to deliver essential services in the meanwhile. Last summer, there were 20 hours a day of blackouts in Tripoli. There were lines at the gas stations, there were lines at the banks. This government’s primary mandate is – some people call it electricity and elections or elections and electricity, the two Es. And, of course, COVID is an issue in Libya too and they’re struggling to get on top of that.</p>
<p>So what we needed to do and what I think was achieved by this gathering was to send the signal and to hear the Libyan prime minister fully commit himself to December elections. Some people have raised doubts about his degree of commitment. There’s the perennial perception that people in power try to stay indefinitely, and in this case, we’re getting good assurances from him that that’s not the case. He plans to respect the process, the so-called LPDF – Libyan Political Dialogue Forum – process that established this date of December 24th.</p>
<p>The elections are really important for a number of reasons, not just to legitimize a long-term, credible Libyan government, but they relate to the third headline for us, which has to do with foreign forces, mercenaries, and fighters. A fully empowered, legitimate Libyan government will be in a much stronger position to turn to some of these foreign actors and say, “Thank you very much, it’s our country now and we’d like to be the ones to define the security cooperation relationships that we’re going to have and not have them imposed on us.” And so we did not get to a complete agreement on this. The Turks did a footnote on the language that relates to foreign forces because the Turks believe their trainers are there with a – by virtue of a legitimate agreement with the – of a viable agreement with a legitimate Libyan government, the previous Government of National Accord. So they don’t like being equated with foreign fighters and mercenaries, and the German foreign minister, I noticed at their press conference, made that point publicly.</p>
<p>But these are contentious issues with some of the other participants. The Egyptians believe that the Turks are just trying to use their influence to embed themselves permanently in Libya with a military presence with an ideological flavor, and so the Egyptians and the French have concerns about that. And there were serious attempts and I think good-faith attempts and useful attempts, because it showed everybody that and it showed the Libyans that there is a strong will to try to bridge the gap here. But they didn’t quite close the deal with the Turks.</p>
<p>The Libyans – again, to have them there as a sovereign government making their own case for themselves was a really instructive moment, because it was quite clear to a number of participants in the group that the Egyptians and the Turks were putting it pretty hard to the Libyans. And that’s not a good look.</p>
<p>So again, the – and then the other important thing on the foreign forces issue is that in addition to whatever might happen in this particular gathering, there have been some discussions underway for a while on how to make progress on the low-hanging fruit, the foreign fighters and mercenaries. You have a ceasefire that’s holding. Most of the foreign parties – I would say all of the foreign parties – realize that trying to achieve their goals by military means isn’t going to work. Those who backed Haftar, it failed. So they’re pretty much all committed now to a political process.</p>
<p>The – sorry, I lost my train of thought. But so the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Yeah, the low-hanging fruit. Thank you. The – everybody understands that getting the Turks and Wagner out is really hard, but to preserve the ceasefire and to build on it, you want to make some progress somewhere. And there is a recognition even by some of these outside parties that if you could do some confidence-building measures that don’t undermine the status quo militarily, that don’t expose one side to an attack, let’s try that.</p>
<p>And so we have – the French have put some pen to paper on this. We’ve – even before that we’re talking to the Turks, and we’re basically in a position where both the Turks and the Russians have agreed that this could be a topic of discussion, that let’s talk about whether you could get 300 Syrians on side and 300 Syrians from the other side, put them on a plane, and get them somewhere just as a tangible, practical first step. These processes always work step by step, and the problem with the differences and the inability to agree on language in the end was because, of course, people were trying to be very ambitious. And yes, the UN Security Council resolutions call for the immediate departure of all foreign forces and fighters and the Libyan ceasefire of October 2020 calls for the departure of all foreign – in 90 days. But it hasn’t happened.</p>
<p>So our approach, the typically American, pragmatic approach, is let’s go for the low-hanging fruit. And we think that we have some basis for moving forward on sort of a bilateral and under the aegis of these other activities and the forum here today was useful to pursue this, but it’s not something that was specifically agreed to at the Berlin conference.</p>
<p>So on those three issues – Libyan sovereignty, elections, foreign fighters – we thought – we found this a useful exercise. Got to congratulate the Germans for the role they’ve played. The previous UN secretary – special representative of the secretary-general, Ghassan Salame, I met him shortly after I started this job. He had just come from Berlin, so this would have been about August of 2019. He had met with Merkel and he had persuaded her that this could be a good thing for the Germans to do. It would be a nice legacy for her. It would – Germany is seen as not as terribly self-interested in Libya as, say, the French or the Italians, and they could play this role. And they’ve done it very well. But they can’t deliver 100 percent agreement. Nobody can right now.</p>
<p>So this was – they did a great job of staging a very good conference. And the last thing I’ll just say is the fact that Secretary Blinken showed up was considered as a very big deal. That’s one thing that brought a number of foreign ministers here. You had the Turk, the Egyptian, the French, the – you had pretty good representation here – the Algerian. And having – there’s something about the Libyan process where the Americans are seen as having kind of, again, a less self-interested perspective than some of the other countries and that our influence can still be put to good use and to have the administration engage at this level was really significant. And since this administration took office, one – they’ve tried to send the signal that – taking Libya a little more seriously. They – people got the message.</p>
<p>Joey Hood, the acting assistant secretary, came out and with – thanks to him coming out at that level, we got the airplane we needed to be able to go into Tripoli. So the first – May 18th, the first visit by the most senior official by an American official – most senior visit by an American official to Tripoli since 2014, and the first time an American ambassador had been there for a couple of years. And then now to have the Secretary come here, there was a sense that the United States is taking this issue seriously, lending its diplomatic influence. We’re not necessarily leading the process; we’re supporting the UN in its work.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that the UN special envoy was not able to attend. I want to respect his privacy, but let’s just say there’s a virus going around, and so he couldn’t come. But he had a representative here and he was watching it on – he’s monitoring it. So he’ll be able to pick up where this left off through some – several things that are going to happen over the coming days to especially drive the election process. And then again on a bilateral basis, we’re going to pursue some of these foreign force issues.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Sure, we can – yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Can I just clarify one thing? So you – there was not a complete agreement in the conference on the withdrawal of foreign forces, largely because of Turkey?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> I’m just going to say there was – because the participants were not able to agree.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> The Turks did a pretty good job of trying to then, in turn, isolate the Egyptians, who couldn’t agree on a different variation. So there are strong feelings – on one side the Turks, on the other side the Egyptians, to some extent the French. Each has a valid position in their own way. The frustrating part about it is that the Libyans were there saying, “Hey, what are we, chopped liver here?” And so their position was we can live with any one of these variations because it’s ultimately aimed at starting a practical process that will result in the departure of foreign forces.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right. But do you &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> If I could – if I could just follow on ’s comment. To underscore an answer to what you just asked – what  said earlier – what we did get, what the participants did agree upon, is something new, which is that foreign fighters &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, I was just going to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> &#8212; need to leave, and that needs to begin now, and that’s something to which all the parties present agreed. On the issue of foreign forces, 2570 sets out that goal. It’s all foreign forces. That’s an aspirational goal. There’s a process here, and saying, “All means all and they all leave tonight – why haven’t they left tonight? Will they leave tomorrow night?” is not, frankly, a realistic approach in a real-world situation such as Libya. Getting at what we think is one of the key destabilizing elements, the presence of those foreign fighters – Syrians, Chadians, Sudanese – that is an important first step and it’s not something we had before.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> Now it has to be made operational.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right. And you also said Turks and Russians have agreed to simultaneously pull out foreign mercenaries, so that was one thing that they &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Fighters.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Fighters.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> I would say fighters.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> We talked specifically – and I would say this is initial agreement to be pursued, but we have interest and agreement in principle to discuss departure of, let’s say, a cohort of Syrian fighters on each side.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Who was here from the Russians?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> The Russian deputy foreign minister, Vershinin.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> Sergey Vershinin.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Sergey Vershinin.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Could I just ask for some more detail on that? You were mentioning the hundreds of foreign fighters coming out and the foreign minister of Libya herself was saying in the coming days. Is that a set process that’s actually something that’s – is that more aspirational that this could just happen in the next few days or is there actually setting something – process set in motion for that to happen?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> This – it’s not a concrete process yet. The – again, the value of Berlin was actually the first real opportunity we’ve had to start to talk how to flesh this out. I believe, and I’m not in a position to confirm, but it’s my understanding that this subject was broached at the Geneva – at the Geneva summit recently. And so there is still work to be done with the Russians on this and the Turks. There’s deep suspicion, of course. But there’s also a realization that there could be some value to them in trying to show something on this. So what we want to do is explore that, and I don’t have a format for you yet on how we would do that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Haven’t the Turks already withdrawn some Syrians or said they’ve withdrawn (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> There was a story a couple of – even more than a couple of months ago that some cohort of Syrians had left.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> We were actually never able to confirm that, and if it did happen it was the only one.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> And this is a really complicated issue because the – who was it? The Emiratis told us that the Tunisian foreign minister had called them and said a lot of these Syrians are actually Tunisians, and the Tunisians don’t want them repatriated to Tunis. They don’t want a bunch of radical foreign fighters on their territory. So it’s not – even if you’ve got agreement to get them out, there are issues about where they would go, who would take them, how do you – it has to be verifiable. There is a mechanism through the UN monitoring presence; there’s a modest UN monitoring presence that’s being set up to monitor the Libyan ceasefire, 60 people or something. And then you have this 5+5 joint military commission of Libyan officers from each – from the west and the east. These are the mechanisms that would be used for verification. So we have a concept on that, but this is still at the initial stages.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> But let’s not be confused: We know who the Syrians are. They are either pro-regime Syrians brought in by Wagner Group or Haftar, or they’re Syrian National Army fighters brought in from northwest Syria by the Turks. There’s no great mystery &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And the Turks are paying them, right?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> &#8212; as to where they are – the issues of payment is a bit obscure and not something I would be confident in commenting on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I understand there’s no concrete process yet, but has the U.S. expressed any openness to providing material support to getting these foreign fighters out if that were to be something that’s needed?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>We’ve talked about lending diplomatic support to the process, and until we really have a better idea of what the process is, I don’t think we’re in a position to talk about &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any numbers at all on either side?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> I mean, people talk – they throw out the number 300 on each side.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Total? 300 fighters?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> To start with on – as an initial tranche.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, but what would the total be?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> To bring out.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>There are thousands.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> She’s asking the total number of &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Oh, how many are there?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible.) There are thousands.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong> Oh, there’s – there are 6,000 Syrians at least.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On both sides combined, you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> No. I think just on the Turkish side there’s 6,000 Syrians. Is that right, , or &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>Yeah. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And that 300 is both sides, Turkish and Russian side?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Do you have 300 from each side &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> This is all sort of notional still here. I don’t want to send the message that the process has been launched.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>But the idea, if it’s ever launched &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> &#8212; Chadians, Sudanese, Janjaweed, Syrians, eventually they all go. There’s got to be a tranche process.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> If there are thousands on the Turkish side, how many are there on the other side?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>Thousands.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thousands?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What does the United States think about Ankara’s position that they are invited?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> The Turks assert, as they did today, that the memorandum of understanding they’ve reached with the Serraj government some years ago continues to apply.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> We don’t dispute that, but we are focused on how to get beyond that.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> And I would simply note I think there is a growing recognition, which is a healthy one, that in a circumstance which we all hope is realized in the course of the coming months where there is a new government that emerges from the elections on December 24th (inaudible) a unified military structure. There is going to have to be a new arrangement for whatever form, if there is one, of train, advise, assist forces are there to help the new unified Libyan Armed Forces. That doesn’t take us to that happy goal tomorrow, and I can’t tell you at, what, 3:00 p.m. plus five it will happen. But that’s certainly the objective, and I think there’s a recognition that things change when there is a government post-election, when there is a unified Libyan military. And referencing to now four-year-old MOUs with a government which would then be twice removed is not going to carry you all that far.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Who picked December 24 for the election?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> The – it was one of the Libyan – or some of the Libyan participants in this LPDF.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I mean, I recognize that – I mean, it’s just like – seems designed for people not to be paying attention to it in most of the countries who are represented here today.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Grinch.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I recognize that – the Grinch? Okay. Yeah, I think that’s (inaudible) &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> No. And let’s give &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; going to get. But, I mean, why have an election on a day when no one in this group, most people who are attending the conference, are really going to be having their eye on the ball?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> This was not done with any view to the Western calendar. This was done &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, clearly. And I think that says my entire point.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> And the Libyans would say: So what? We’re not here to please the West. We’re trying to salvage our country.</p>
<p>And what people didn’t want, I think, was to have this drag into next year and have it keep being put off. But they pushed it off obviously as late as they could this year. I don’t know where the 24th comes in in terms of the Muslim calendar in December, but we have to – we should give credit to Stephanie Williams and the LPDF process, because basically that process took 74 people and had them make decisions about the future of Libya politically that have so far managed to stick, and that’s quite an achievement. And now the challenge is to keep it going.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I don’t – I mean, it’s fine for the Libyans to have – they can have – anyone can have their election on any day they want to. But in the – in a situation like this where you have conferences – this is the second one, right – where there are a ton of Western countries involved and any number of things can go wrong, are you going to tell me that any of the countries who are interested, with some few exceptions, are really going to be in a position on Christmas Eve to – or Christmas or over that week to actually do anything about it besides (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Well, I think we’re going to know before December 24th whether this is going to fall into place. There are going to have to be – we’ll see if there’s some patriotic election monitors and observers who want to go out around that time of year. But, I mean, nobody – you’re the first person who’s ever raised that question with me.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just ask you – you mentioned the commitment to the election. Was that conditional in any way, saying that we need some more support from the outside world? Where do you think the countries are in terms of the (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>I wouldn’t say it was conditional in the way he put it, but I – they will in the same breath say there are definitely going to be obstacles here – security, logistical, financial. But I think they accept our point that, yes, there are obstacles but none of them is insurmountable. And the – there is always a temptation when you’re in power to think you need to stay a little bit longer, and I think the prime minister is understanding that he wants to resist that temptation in the interests of the country.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On the – you said that the process is not a concrete one. So what is next? What is going to make it more concrete? What should we expect, or should we just wait for some withdrawals to (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>I would – let’s just say I’m not in a position to give you any detail on that, so I don’t want to speculate.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How would you describe America’s national interest in the outcome here?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Libya had the potential and potential – could still have the potential to be another ungoverned space where terrorists can operate with impunity. ISIS was quite well-installed in Libya, had to be beaten back. In the last month, there have been two small attacks, again, in Libya that were claimed by ISIS. And so it’s a reminder that the terrorist issue has not gone away, and I think for us that’s a primary interest.</p>
<p>The Russian involvement in Libya has turned this now into something that has geopolitical implications for the United States, and it’s on NATO’s southern flank that the Russians have embedded. They are projecting influence into sub-Saharan Africa. Wagner is – we don’t accept that this is a private company; it’s an armed Russian state, and they’re carrying out Russia’s strategic objectives in sub-Saharan Africa and in the southern Med.</p>
<p>Libya is a huge supplier of oil and gas; that’s not the driving interest that it might have been at one time, but it’s still a factor in global economic affairs.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And migration also?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> The migration issue.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>The migration issue is – it’s sort of not directly related to us, but to the extent it’s a tool to destabilize allies and partners in Europe, of course it’s an issue. And it’s a humanitarian issue. More Libyans are going to drown every day now because there’s a lot of migrants in Libya who at one point might have been happy to be there and do menial labor or have a job or whatever, but now because of the instability and the fighting and the fact the country hasn’t recovered yet, they’re not sticking around. And so from just a humanitarian perspective and a political perspective of the Europeans, you want to try to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> I know  has to take off shortly, so , is there anything you want to say just on the bilateral piece?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> Yeah, let me just say I think you’ve heard really a good summary of the topics and the tone when the two foreign – Foreign Minister Maas and the Secretary gave their on-the-record press conference, so I don’t think there’s a lot I can add there. The foreign minister thanked the Secretary for coming back to Europe, returning to Europe this week, underscored the Germany guiding principle of foreign policy of course is multilateralism, and thanked the United States for re-engagement, revitalization of so many multilateral fora. The fact that this is a week after President Biden came to Europe and participated in that series of summits that you’re very familiar with, he came first to Europe. A combined bilateral and multilateral diplomacy engagement was important.</p>
<p>Both of them talked (inaudible) about how there’s a focus on strengthening our own countries, and of course that’s why strong bilateral relations and multilateral relations are good, delivering results efficiently, productively, effectively for our own citizens is something we can do together, and I think they highlighted the fact that the competitive advantage that we have, and you can see this with the President’s progression from the G7 to the NATO summit to the U.S.-EU summit, is indeed the set of partnerships and alliances that we have where the partners and allies themselves choose to come together and support each other through these structures we’ve created. And the Secretary highlighted a response to the thanks that the minister gave for him coming here; in fact, wanted to recognize German leadership on issues like Libya and what my unnamed colleague here has just described. And the Secretary gave the foreign minister a fuller readout of the President Biden meeting with President Putin, just a chance to go into more details there, and promised, of course, to keep in close consultation on those set of issues. Safe to underscore we are very clear-eyed and sober in terms of relations with Russia.</p>
<p>Of course, the foreign minister highlighted the German elections, which are very much on people’s minds here. As we’ve seen in other fora, Russian efforts to influence German elections of course are something they keep a close eye on. They also were able to talk about Turkey, including a readout with a little more detail of the President’s meeting with President Erdogan, and focus on Afghanistan, and the work on maintaining a strong diplomatic mission there as the troops draw down, including international zone security and other issues. They touched on Belarus and highlighted the strong unity that’s remained between the U.S., the EU, and of course the UK, and Canada as well in terms of coordinating our sanctions and our response, and looking at ways to respond to things like the Ryanair incident and the other sort of outrageous crackdown that Lukashenko has perpetrated against people there who were just speaking out for fundamental rights and for a government that delivers for them.</p>
<p>They did talk about Syria and the humanitarian access issue that is important, of course, for – with the UN. Also touched on Iraq, and talked about the critical elections coming up there, our joint support for UNAMI and election monitoring, since you bring up elections. And did talk about Ukraine, of course; reviewed the Normandy format and the fact that there is a dynamic still there, albeit a tough one. And then, of course, as you guys asked and the Secretary described, they did discuss Nord Stream 2 and – in the context of this extremely broad and collegial, familial relationship where we’re able to pursue so much with the Germans, we do have a big difference on that particular issue. Both sides have acknowledged that. And we need to find a way to get to some significant steps in terms of the – mitigating the threats as the Secretary said on the record. And I think the minister acknowledged that and the fact that they were tackling this &#8212; well, and I won’t go into more of the details there, but that diplomacy continues, but I think, again, underscores what they both said: The broad relationship and its robust set of issues on which we’re working together is really quite, quite strong. And that allows us then to have an area where we disagree quite strongly, as the foreign minister acknowledged; he’s heard the Secretary and the U.S. position on this, and they’ll keep working on it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can you – , can I ask you about – there was a report today that the French and German have agreed together to invite President Putin to come and visit, and I wondered if that – this was brought in the EU, much to the dismay of the Baltic states. It was a big story in the FT this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> Sorry, I missed that. It did not come up in their meeting.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But I wonder if that was something that was discussed at all in the President’s meetings last week or discussed &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE: </strong>That, I wouldn’t be able to help you on. We’ve gotten no readouts.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Anything on it? Is this, like, totally news to you?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> To me, I’m not following Putin’s travels or this FT story. But &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, the story was about Macron and Merkel, that they agreed to do this, and they told the EU today that they want to do it.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> I’d just &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> &#8212; talk to them. I know in the Normandy format, they’re looking at a foreign ministers meeting &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, no, this was &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> &#8212; which is a step they’ve been talking about for some time.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So – just to be clear, then, so the chancellor didn’t pose the idea of having Russia come to some future EU meeting in the meeting with the Secretary today?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> I really don’t know what the chancellor has said. I was not in the meeting with the chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Got it.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> But in the meeting with Foreign Minister Maas, there was not a discussion, but they did discuss at the EU foreign ministers meeting yesterday, talked about having – for instance, the Iraqi foreign minister was there and they went through the kind of issues, they talked there. But that piece didn’t come up in the bilat meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister Maas.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, then let me just get in a Nord Stream 2 question. So, I mean, he was asked by one of the German reporters, I think, that – could there be an agreement on how you mitigate the Russian threat by the time that Merkel visits Washington, and he said, well, that’ll be great if it could happen, but – I know you don’t want to get into it, but how advanced are these discussions? Is there any common ground here on how they can actually do it? And the white paper that – or the non-paper – sorry – Jake gave to the German delegation before the President came here with U.S. suggestions, how &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, he – so after the decision on the – you know this, . Let’s – don’t play dumb.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> We’re going down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Laughter) Where we were back in Iceland and the sanctions announcement came out with the waivers, right, the Germans sent the team to Washington.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. And they reiterated their proposal from, like, two years ago about how they were going to try to allay your concerns. I won’t go into those details, but you know them well. Anyway, in response, Jake or someone at the NSC presented them with a response. And they came back here, they had been discussing this. I want to know where that stands, and if you think that there is any possibility that by the time that Merkel visits Washington there could be some kind of a resolution to this.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> I would agree violently with the Secretary that that would be a good thing and that we’re both – both sides are working hard on this. But it’s the kind of diplomacy and discussion and engagement. Today is another useful step there, and again, I wasn’t in the meeting with the chancellor, so to just keep at it. (Inaudible) And obviously, everybody’s aware of the various timelines, and certainly we all want to see the chancellor’s visit in Washington to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> One more data point on Sunday. The Secretary will have an opportunity to meet with the Israeli foreign minister in Rome. We will have a bilateral engagement with Foreign Minister Lapid on Sunday. We’ll have more details on the timing of that as it comes together, but wanted to pass that along as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> We wanted to do this just on background attributable to senior State Department officials to give you a sense of some of the discussions today, and we thought we would start with the Libya discussion. And  can offer a sense of how things went, the progress that was made, and what remains. So again, we’ll just do this on background.</p>
<p>And with that, I see  joining us. He will be another senior State Department official and he can obviously &#8212;</p>
<p>(Chit-chat.)</p>
<p>So let’s start with this – let’s start with this senior State Department official to talk about Libya and we’ll go from there.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Okay, hey. I think there are three things that we’re headlining out of this conference today. One is the – it’s the first appearance by a sovereign Libyan more or less united – interim united government in a long, long time, and they made their appearance on the international stage. They articulated their case, pushed for various things, and that’s already a huge step forward from where we were two years ago. So the Berlin process, which started with this summit in January of 2020, has now taken the next step with the participation of a sovereign interim Libyan Government.</p>
<p>The second headline is that – has to do with the elections. I mean, precisely, this is an interim government. Its mission is to establish – pave the way for elections on December 24th of 2021 and to deliver essential services in the meanwhile. Last summer, there were 20 hours a day of blackouts in Tripoli. There were lines at the gas stations, there were lines at the banks. This government’s primary mandate is – some people call it electricity and elections or elections and electricity, the two Es. And, of course, COVID is an issue in Libya too and they’re struggling to get on top of that.</p>
<p>So what we needed to do and what I think was achieved by this gathering was to send the signal and to hear the Libyan prime minister fully commit himself to December elections. Some people have raised doubts about his degree of commitment. There’s the perennial perception that people in power try to stay indefinitely, and in this case, we’re getting good assurances from him that that’s not the case. He plans to respect the process, the so-called LPDF – Libyan Political Dialogue Forum – process that established this date of December 24th.</p>
<p>The elections are really important for a number of reasons, not just to legitimize a long-term, credible Libyan government, but they relate to the third headline for us, which has to do with foreign forces, mercenaries, and fighters. A fully empowered, legitimate Libyan government will be in a much stronger position to turn to some of these foreign actors and say, “Thank you very much, it’s our country now and we’d like to be the ones to define the security cooperation relationships that we’re going to have and not have them imposed on us.” And so we did not get to a complete agreement on this. The Turks did a footnote on the language that relates to foreign forces because the Turks believe their trainers are there with a – by virtue of a legitimate agreement with the – of a viable agreement with a legitimate Libyan government, the previous Government of National Accord. So they don’t like being equated with foreign fighters and mercenaries, and the German foreign minister, I noticed at their press conference, made that point publicly.</p>
<p>But these are contentious issues with some of the other participants. The Egyptians believe that the Turks are just trying to use their influence to embed themselves permanently in Libya with a military presence with an ideological flavor, and so the Egyptians and the French have concerns about that. And there were serious attempts and I think good-faith attempts and useful attempts, because it showed everybody that and it showed the Libyans that there is a strong will to try to bridge the gap here. But they didn’t quite close the deal with the Turks.</p>
<p>The Libyans – again, to have them there as a sovereign government making their own case for themselves was a really instructive moment, because it was quite clear to a number of participants in the group that the Egyptians and the Turks were putting it pretty hard to the Libyans. And that’s not a good look.</p>
<p>So again, the – and then the other important thing on the foreign forces issue is that in addition to whatever might happen in this particular gathering, there have been some discussions underway for a while on how to make progress on the low-hanging fruit, the foreign fighters and mercenaries. You have a ceasefire that’s holding. Most of the foreign parties – I would say all of the foreign parties – realize that trying to achieve their goals by military means isn’t going to work. Those who backed Haftar, it failed. So they’re pretty much all committed now to a political process.</p>
<p>The – sorry, I lost my train of thought. But so the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Yeah, the low-hanging fruit. Thank you. The – everybody understands that getting the Turks and Wagner out is really hard, but to preserve the ceasefire and to build on it, you want to make some progress somewhere. And there is a recognition even by some of these outside parties that if you could do some confidence-building measures that don’t undermine the status quo militarily, that don’t expose one side to an attack, let’s try that.</p>
<p>And so we have – the French have put some pen to paper on this. We’ve – even before that we’re talking to the Turks, and we’re basically in a position where both the Turks and the Russians have agreed that this could be a topic of discussion, that let’s talk about whether you could get 300 Syrians on side and 300 Syrians from the other side, put them on a plane, and get them somewhere just as a tangible, practical first step. These processes always work step by step, and the problem with the differences and the inability to agree on language in the end was because, of course, people were trying to be very ambitious. And yes, the UN Security Council resolutions call for the immediate departure of all foreign forces and fighters and the Libyan ceasefire of October 2020 calls for the departure of all foreign – in 90 days. But it hasn’t happened.</p>
<p>So our approach, the typically American, pragmatic approach, is let’s go for the low-hanging fruit. And we think that we have some basis for moving forward on sort of a bilateral and under the aegis of these other activities and the forum here today was useful to pursue this, but it’s not something that was specifically agreed to at the Berlin conference.</p>
<p>So on those three issues – Libyan sovereignty, elections, foreign fighters – we thought – we found this a useful exercise. Got to congratulate the Germans for the role they’ve played. The previous UN secretary – special representative of the secretary-general, Ghassan Salame, I met him shortly after I started this job. He had just come from Berlin, so this would have been about August of 2019. He had met with Merkel and he had persuaded her that this could be a good thing for the Germans to do. It would be a nice legacy for her. It would – Germany is seen as not as terribly self-interested in Libya as, say, the French or the Italians, and they could play this role. And they’ve done it very well. But they can’t deliver 100 percent agreement. Nobody can right now.</p>
<p>So this was – they did a great job of staging a very good conference. And the last thing I’ll just say is the fact that Secretary Blinken showed up was considered as a very big deal. That’s one thing that brought a number of foreign ministers here. You had the Turk, the Egyptian, the French, the – you had pretty good representation here – the Algerian. And having – there’s something about the Libyan process where the Americans are seen as having kind of, again, a less self-interested perspective than some of the other countries and that our influence can still be put to good use and to have the administration engage at this level was really significant. And since this administration took office, one – they’ve tried to send the signal that – taking Libya a little more seriously. They – people got the message.</p>
<p>Joey Hood, the acting assistant secretary, came out and with – thanks to him coming out at that level, we got the airplane we needed to be able to go into Tripoli. So the first – May 18th, the first visit by the most senior official by an American official – most senior visit by an American official to Tripoli since 2014, and the first time an American ambassador had been there for a couple of years. And then now to have the Secretary come here, there was a sense that the United States is taking this issue seriously, lending its diplomatic influence. We’re not necessarily leading the process; we’re supporting the UN in its work.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that the UN special envoy was not able to attend. I want to respect his privacy, but let’s just say there’s a virus going around, and so he couldn’t come. But he had a representative here and he was watching it on – he’s monitoring it. So he’ll be able to pick up where this left off through some – several things that are going to happen over the coming days to especially drive the election process. And then again on a bilateral basis, we’re going to pursue some of these foreign force issues.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> Sure, we can – yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Can I just clarify one thing? So you – there was not a complete agreement in the conference on the withdrawal of foreign forces, largely because of Turkey?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> I’m just going to say there was – because the participants were not able to agree.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> The Turks did a pretty good job of trying to then, in turn, isolate the Egyptians, who couldn’t agree on a different variation. So there are strong feelings – on one side the Turks, on the other side the Egyptians, to some extent the French. Each has a valid position in their own way. The frustrating part about it is that the Libyans were there saying, “Hey, what are we, chopped liver here?” And so their position was we can live with any one of these variations because it’s ultimately aimed at starting a practical process that will result in the departure of foreign forces.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right. But do you &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> If I could – if I could just follow on ’s comment. To underscore an answer to what you just asked – what  said earlier – what we did get, what the participants did agree upon, is something new, which is that foreign fighters &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, I was just going to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> &#8212; need to leave, and that needs to begin now, and that’s something to which all the parties present agreed. On the issue of foreign forces, 2570 sets out that goal. It’s all foreign forces. That’s an aspirational goal. There’s a process here, and saying, “All means all and they all leave tonight – why haven’t they left tonight? Will they leave tomorrow night?” is not, frankly, a realistic approach in a real-world situation such as Libya. Getting at what we think is one of the key destabilizing elements, the presence of those foreign fighters – Syrians, Chadians, Sudanese – that is an important first step and it’s not something we had before.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> Now it has to be made operational.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right. And you also said Turks and Russians have agreed to simultaneously pull out foreign mercenaries, so that was one thing that they &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Fighters.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Fighters.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> I would say fighters.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> We talked specifically – and I would say this is initial agreement to be pursued, but we have interest and agreement in principle to discuss departure of, let’s say, a cohort of Syrian fighters on each side.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Who was here from the Russians?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> The Russian deputy foreign minister, Vershinin.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> Sergey Vershinin.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Sergey Vershinin.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Could I just ask for some more detail on that? You were mentioning the hundreds of foreign fighters coming out and the foreign minister of Libya herself was saying in the coming days. Is that a set process that’s actually something that’s – is that more aspirational that this could just happen in the next few days or is there actually setting something – process set in motion for that to happen?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> This – it’s not a concrete process yet. The – again, the value of Berlin was actually the first real opportunity we’ve had to start to talk how to flesh this out. I believe, and I’m not in a position to confirm, but it’s my understanding that this subject was broached at the Geneva – at the Geneva summit recently. And so there is still work to be done with the Russians on this and the Turks. There’s deep suspicion, of course. But there’s also a realization that there could be some value to them in trying to show something on this. So what we want to do is explore that, and I don’t have a format for you yet on how we would do that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Haven’t the Turks already withdrawn some Syrians or said they’ve withdrawn (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> There was a story a couple of – even more than a couple of months ago that some cohort of Syrians had left.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> We were actually never able to confirm that, and if it did happen it was the only one.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> And this is a really complicated issue because the – who was it? The Emiratis told us that the Tunisian foreign minister had called them and said a lot of these Syrians are actually Tunisians, and the Tunisians don’t want them repatriated to Tunis. They don’t want a bunch of radical foreign fighters on their territory. So it’s not – even if you’ve got agreement to get them out, there are issues about where they would go, who would take them, how do you – it has to be verifiable. There is a mechanism through the UN monitoring presence; there’s a modest UN monitoring presence that’s being set up to monitor the Libyan ceasefire, 60 people or something. And then you have this 5+5 joint military commission of Libyan officers from each – from the west and the east. These are the mechanisms that would be used for verification. So we have a concept on that, but this is still at the initial stages.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> But let’s not be confused: We know who the Syrians are. They are either pro-regime Syrians brought in by Wagner Group or Haftar, or they’re Syrian National Army fighters brought in from northwest Syria by the Turks. There’s no great mystery &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And the Turks are paying them, right?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> &#8212; as to where they are – the issues of payment is a bit obscure and not something I would be confident in commenting on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I understand there’s no concrete process yet, but has the U.S. expressed any openness to providing material support to getting these foreign fighters out if that were to be something that’s needed?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>We’ve talked about lending diplomatic support to the process, and until we really have a better idea of what the process is, I don’t think we’re in a position to talk about &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you have any numbers at all on either side?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> I mean, people talk – they throw out the number 300 on each side.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Total? 300 fighters?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> To start with on – as an initial tranche.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, but what would the total be?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> To bring out.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>There are thousands.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> She’s asking the total number of &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Oh, how many are there?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible.) There are thousands.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong> Oh, there’s – there are 6,000 Syrians at least.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On both sides combined, you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> No. I think just on the Turkish side there’s 6,000 Syrians. Is that right, , or &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>Yeah. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And that 300 is both sides, Turkish and Russian side?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Do you have 300 from each side &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> This is all sort of notional still here. I don’t want to send the message that the process has been launched.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>But the idea, if it’s ever launched &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> &#8212; Chadians, Sudanese, Janjaweed, Syrians, eventually they all go. There’s got to be a tranche process.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> If there are thousands on the Turkish side, how many are there on the other side?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>Thousands.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thousands?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What does the United States think about Ankara’s position that they are invited?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> The Turks assert, as they did today, that the memorandum of understanding they’ve reached with the Serraj government some years ago continues to apply.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> We don’t dispute that, but we are focused on how to get beyond that.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> And I would simply note I think there is a growing recognition, which is a healthy one, that in a circumstance which we all hope is realized in the course of the coming months where there is a new government that emerges from the elections on December 24th (inaudible) a unified military structure. There is going to have to be a new arrangement for whatever form, if there is one, of train, advise, assist forces are there to help the new unified Libyan Armed Forces. That doesn’t take us to that happy goal tomorrow, and I can’t tell you at, what, 3:00 p.m. plus five it will happen. But that’s certainly the objective, and I think there’s a recognition that things change when there is a government post-election, when there is a unified Libyan military. And referencing to now four-year-old MOUs with a government which would then be twice removed is not going to carry you all that far.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Who picked December 24 for the election?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> The – it was one of the Libyan – or some of the Libyan participants in this LPDF.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I mean, I recognize that – I mean, it’s just like – seems designed for people not to be paying attention to it in most of the countries who are represented here today.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Grinch.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I recognize that – the Grinch? Okay. Yeah, I think that’s (inaudible) &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> No. And let’s give &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; going to get. But, I mean, why have an election on a day when no one in this group, most people who are attending the conference, are really going to be having their eye on the ball?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> This was not done with any view to the Western calendar. This was done &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, clearly. And I think that says my entire point.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO:</strong> And the Libyans would say: So what? We’re not here to please the West. We’re trying to salvage our country.</p>
<p>And what people didn’t want, I think, was to have this drag into next year and have it keep being put off. But they pushed it off obviously as late as they could this year. I don’t know where the 24th comes in in terms of the Muslim calendar in December, but we have to – we should give credit to Stephanie Williams and the LPDF process, because basically that process took 74 people and had them make decisions about the future of Libya politically that have so far managed to stick, and that’s quite an achievement. And now the challenge is to keep it going.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I don’t – I mean, it’s fine for the Libyans to have – they can have – anyone can have their election on any day they want to. But in the – in a situation like this where you have conferences – this is the second one, right – where there are a ton of Western countries involved and any number of things can go wrong, are you going to tell me that any of the countries who are interested, with some few exceptions, are really going to be in a position on Christmas Eve to – or Christmas or over that week to actually do anything about it besides (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Well, I think we’re going to know before December 24th whether this is going to fall into place. There are going to have to be – we’ll see if there’s some patriotic election monitors and observers who want to go out around that time of year. But, I mean, nobody – you’re the first person who’s ever raised that question with me.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just ask you – you mentioned the commitment to the election. Was that conditional in any way, saying that we need some more support from the outside world? Where do you think the countries are in terms of the (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>I wouldn’t say it was conditional in the way he put it, but I – they will in the same breath say there are definitely going to be obstacles here – security, logistical, financial. But I think they accept our point that, yes, there are obstacles but none of them is insurmountable. And the – there is always a temptation when you’re in power to think you need to stay a little bit longer, and I think the prime minister is understanding that he wants to resist that temptation in the interests of the country.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On the – you said that the process is not a concrete one. So what is next? What is going to make it more concrete? What should we expect, or should we just wait for some withdrawals to (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE: </strong>I would – let’s just say I’m not in a position to give you any detail on that, so I don’t want to speculate.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How would you describe America’s national interest in the outcome here?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ONE:</strong> Libya had the potential and potential – could still have the potential to be another ungoverned space where terrorists can operate with impunity. ISIS was quite well-installed in Libya, had to be beaten back. In the last month, there have been two small attacks, again, in Libya that were claimed by ISIS. And so it’s a reminder that the terrorist issue has not gone away, and I think for us that’s a primary interest.</p>
<p>The Russian involvement in Libya has turned this now into something that has geopolitical implications for the United States, and it’s on NATO’s southern flank that the Russians have embedded. They are projecting influence into sub-Saharan Africa. Wagner is – we don’t accept that this is a private company; it’s an armed Russian state, and they’re carrying out Russia’s strategic objectives in sub-Saharan Africa and in the southern Med.</p>
<p>Libya is a huge supplier of oil and gas; that’s not the driving interest that it might have been at one time, but it’s still a factor in global economic affairs.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And migration also?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> The migration issue.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TWO: </strong>The migration issue is – it’s sort of not directly related to us, but to the extent it’s a tool to destabilize allies and partners in Europe, of course it’s an issue. And it’s a humanitarian issue. More Libyans are going to drown every day now because there’s a lot of migrants in Libya who at one point might have been happy to be there and do menial labor or have a job or whatever, but now because of the instability and the fighting and the fact the country hasn’t recovered yet, they’re not sticking around. And so from just a humanitarian perspective and a political perspective of the Europeans, you want to try to help with this.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> I know  has to take off shortly, so , is there anything you want to say just on the bilateral piece?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> Yeah, let me just say I think you’ve heard really a good summary of the topics and the tone when the two foreign – Foreign Minister Maas and the Secretary gave their on-the-record press conference, so I don’t think there’s a lot I can add there. The foreign minister thanked the Secretary for coming back to Europe, returning to Europe this week, underscored the Germany guiding principle of foreign policy of course is multilateralism, and thanked the United States for re-engagement, revitalization of so many multilateral fora. The fact that this is a week after President Biden came to Europe and participated in that series of summits that you’re very familiar with, he came first to Europe. A combined bilateral and multilateral diplomacy engagement was important.</p>
<p>Both of them talked (inaudible) about how there’s a focus on strengthening our own countries, and of course that’s why strong bilateral relations and multilateral relations are good, delivering results efficiently, productively, effectively for our own citizens is something we can do together, and I think they highlighted the fact that the competitive advantage that we have, and you can see this with the President’s progression from the G7 to the NATO summit to the U.S.-EU summit, is indeed the set of partnerships and alliances that we have where the partners and allies themselves choose to come together and support each other through these structures we’ve created. And the Secretary highlighted a response to the thanks that the minister gave for him coming here; in fact, wanted to recognize German leadership on issues like Libya and what my unnamed colleague here has just described. And the Secretary gave the foreign minister a fuller readout of the President Biden meeting with President Putin, just a chance to go into more details there, and promised, of course, to keep in close consultation on those set of issues. Safe to underscore we are very clear-eyed and sober in terms of relations with Russia.</p>
<p>Of course, the foreign minister highlighted the German elections, which are very much on people’s minds here. As we’ve seen in other fora, Russian efforts to influence German elections of course are something they keep a close eye on. They also were able to talk about Turkey, including a readout with a little more detail of the President’s meeting with President Erdogan, and focus on Afghanistan, and the work on maintaining a strong diplomatic mission there as the troops draw down, including international zone security and other issues. They touched on Belarus and highlighted the strong unity that’s remained between the U.S., the EU, and of course the UK, and Canada as well in terms of coordinating our sanctions and our response, and looking at ways to respond to things like the Ryanair incident and the other sort of outrageous crackdown that Lukashenko has perpetrated against people there who were just speaking out for fundamental rights and for a government that delivers for them.</p>
<p>They did talk about Syria and the humanitarian access issue that is important, of course, for – with the UN. Also touched on Iraq, and talked about the critical elections coming up there, our joint support for UNAMI and election monitoring, since you bring up elections. And did talk about Ukraine, of course; reviewed the Normandy format and the fact that there is a dynamic still there, albeit a tough one. And then, of course, as you guys asked and the Secretary described, they did discuss Nord Stream 2 and – in the context of this extremely broad and collegial, familial relationship where we’re able to pursue so much with the Germans, we do have a big difference on that particular issue. Both sides have acknowledged that. And we need to find a way to get to some significant steps in terms of the – mitigating the threats as the Secretary said on the record. And I think the minister acknowledged that and the fact that they were tackling this &#8212; well, and I won’t go into more of the details there, but that diplomacy continues, but I think, again, underscores what they both said: The broad relationship and its robust set of issues on which we’re working together is really quite, quite strong. And that allows us then to have an area where we disagree quite strongly, as the foreign minister acknowledged; he’s heard the Secretary and the U.S. position on this, and they’ll keep working on it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can you – , can I ask you about – there was a report today that the French and German have agreed together to invite President Putin to come and visit, and I wondered if that – this was brought in the EU, much to the dismay of the Baltic states. It was a big story in the FT this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> Sorry, I missed that. It did not come up in their meeting.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But I wonder if that was something that was discussed at all in the President’s meetings last week or discussed &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE: </strong>That, I wouldn’t be able to help you on. We’ve gotten no readouts.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Anything on it? Is this, like, totally news to you?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> To me, I’m not following Putin’s travels or this FT story. But &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, the story was about Macron and Merkel, that they agreed to do this, and they told the EU today that they want to do it.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> I’d just &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> &#8212; talk to them. I know in the Normandy format, they’re looking at a foreign ministers meeting &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, no, this was &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> &#8212; which is a step they’ve been talking about for some time.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So – just to be clear, then, so the chancellor didn’t pose the idea of having Russia come to some future EU meeting in the meeting with the Secretary today?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> I really don’t know what the chancellor has said. I was not in the meeting with the chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Got it.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> But in the meeting with Foreign Minister Maas, there was not a discussion, but they did discuss at the EU foreign ministers meeting yesterday, talked about having – for instance, the Iraqi foreign minister was there and they went through the kind of issues, they talked there. But that piece didn’t come up in the bilat meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister Maas.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> All right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, then let me just get in a Nord Stream 2 question. So, I mean, he was asked by one of the German reporters, I think, that – could there be an agreement on how you mitigate the Russian threat by the time that Merkel visits Washington, and he said, well, that’ll be great if it could happen, but – I know you don’t want to get into it, but how advanced are these discussions? Is there any common ground here on how they can actually do it? And the white paper that – or the non-paper – sorry – Jake gave to the German delegation before the President came here with U.S. suggestions, how &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, he – so after the decision on the – you know this, . Let’s – don’t play dumb.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> We’re going down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Laughter) Where we were back in Iceland and the sanctions announcement came out with the waivers, right, the Germans sent the team to Washington.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. And they reiterated their proposal from, like, two years ago about how they were going to try to allay your concerns. I won’t go into those details, but you know them well. Anyway, in response, Jake or someone at the NSC presented them with a response. And they came back here, they had been discussing this. I want to know where that stands, and if you think that there is any possibility that by the time that Merkel visits Washington there could be some kind of a resolution to this.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL THREE:</strong> I would agree violently with the Secretary that that would be a good thing and that we’re both – both sides are working hard on this. But it’s the kind of diplomacy and discussion and engagement. Today is another useful step there, and again, I wasn’t in the meeting with the chancellor, so to just keep at it. (Inaudible) And obviously, everybody’s aware of the various timelines, and certainly we all want to see the chancellor’s visit in Washington to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong> One more data point on Sunday. The Secretary will have an opportunity to meet with the Israeli foreign minister in Rome. We will have a bilateral engagement with Foreign Minister Lapid on Sunday. We’ll have more details on the timing of that as it comes together, but wanted to pass that along as well.</p>
