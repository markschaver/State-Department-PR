					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Millions of people in Ethiopia continue to face acute food insecurity and extreme hunger as a direct result of conflict.  We are encouraged that the government of Ethiopia and regional authorities in Tigray and Afar have taken steps in recent weeks to enable the delivery of desperately needed food aid to war-affected communities.  We urge the parties to accelerate, uphold, and expand these efforts to ensure, as President Biden has said, immediate, sustained, and unimpeded humanitarian access to all Ethiopians affected by this conflict.  The United States stands ready to continue to assist in this life-saving endeavor.</p>
<p>In recent months, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has taken a series of encouraging actions that have laid the groundwork for an end to conflict, including lifting the state of emergency, releasing some political prisoners and detainees, and, in parallel with Tigrayan authorities, declaring an effective cessation of hostilities.  We are similarly encouraged that Tigrayan forces have withdrawn most of their forces from Afar and have reiterated their commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.  We now urge the parties, as my team and I have in recent days, to seize the opportunity to advance a negotiated ceasefire, including the necessary security arrangements, and call for the restoration of essential services in Tigray on an urgent basis.</p>
<p>The United States remains committed to a unified, prosperous, and sovereign Ethiopia and to supporting an inclusive political process to heal the country’s divisions and provide peace and security for all Ethiopians.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Jalina Porter, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-misc"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Good afternoon. Thank you so much for joining today’s press briefing. I just have two updates at the top, and then I will start with taking your questions.</p>
<p>Today marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention, or CWC. For a quarter century, the United States has worked with its allies and partners to help rid the world of chemical weapons and also deter their use by anyone, anywhere, and under any circumstances.</p>
<p>In recent years the world has witnessed chemical weapons use that challenges the CWC’s core prohibitions: by the Assad regime and ISIS in Syria; by Russian Government operatives against the Skripals in the UK and Aleksey Navalny in Russia; and by the DPRK against Kim Jong Nam in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Syria remains in non-compliance with the CWC, and we will continue to work to hold the Assad regime accountable for its repeated use of chemical weapons against its own people.</p>
<p>We will also continue our efforts to hold the Kremlin accountable for its non-compliance with the CWC, repeated use of chemical weapons, and ongoing efforts to shield the Assad regime from accountability for its chemical weapons use. Furthermore, we will continue to closely monitor for the possible use of chemical munitions by Russian forces in Ukraine.</p>
<p>On this anniversary we renew our commitment to upholding the CWC, and also note the convention’s important role in contributing to U.S. national security.</p>
<p>And I’ll take a point of personal privilege to just acknowledge our State Department reporter colleague, Conor Finnegan of ABC. Conor, if you’re on, or even if you aren’t, I hope you get this message. We know this is your last day. I just want to take a moment to say thank you for all of your contributions, for your insightful and fair and consistent reporting. We certainly will miss you here, and wish you the very best on your next chapter.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Cindy Saine.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-ukraine"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Could you please confirm a report that American citizen and former U.S. Marine Willy Joseph Cancel was killed in Ukraine, fighting along Ukrainian forces? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Cindy. Well, we are aware of these reports, and certainly stand ready to provide all possible consular assistance to the family. However, out of respect to the family during this very difficult time, we don’t have anything further to announce.</p>
<p>We also do want to reiterate that U.S. citizens should not travel to Ukraine during this active armed conflict. It is a very dangerous situation – and the singling out of U.S. citizens in Ukraine by Russian Government security officials, and that U.S. citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately, if it is safe to do so using commercial or privately available ground transportation options.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Matt Lee, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong> Hi, Matt. Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-nepal"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hey. Okay. I got two things, both brief. Yesterday, the Secretary when he was on the Hill was asked about this Chinese memory chip company, YMTC, and whether it is violating laws that provide the – laws against providing technology to Huawei and others. He did not have an answer. I’m wondering if you guys have looked into it and do have an answer now and, if you do, what that is.</p>
<p>And the second thing is are you aware of an incident in Nepal recently, where you – in relation to a custody – child custody case. U.S. Embassy guards or officials were assaulted. I believe this happened on the 16th. Anyway, are you – this involves a child who was apparently abducted to Nepal by one of her parents. And anyway, I know that you probably won’t be able to talk about that because of privacy, but I want to know if you have anything on the assault on embassy officials. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks. I’ll start with your second question. So the State Department is aware of reports of an alleged child abduction case in Nepal involving a U.S. citizen, and we are providing all appropriate consular assistance.</p>
<p>To your point on assaults on staff, I am just now learning about that in real time, so I don’t have anything to offer. But what I will say is what we continue to underscore from here, that one of the department’s highest priorities is the welfare of U.S. citizens overseas, and we also recognize that international parental child abduction cases are, by nature, extremely difficult. They’re also extremely complex, and we’re committed to doing everything that we can to assist in resolving these challenging cases.</p>
<p>To your first question, we don’t have anything to offer, but we’re certainly happy to take that back to the team and get you any updates as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Let’s go to the line of Laura Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible) for taking my question. I hope you can hear me.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you, Laura.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-georgia"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, thank you. Have any State Department officials met with Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili while she’s here in Washington? And is the State Department concerned that Russian threats to Georgia pose a risk to the U.S. interests in the region? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Laura. I don’t have any meetings to read out at this time, but what I can say from here on Georgia: from the beginning, the American people have stood in solidarity with the people of Georgia and their desire to be a free and sovereign country. Over the years we’ve also developed into strategic partners working together towards our shared vision of Georgia fully integrated into the Euro-Atlantic family of nations, and as a part of a Europe whole, free, and at peace.</p>
<p>Let’s go over to Conor Finnegan, please.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-afghanistan"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Jalina, thank you for your generous words. It’s been a privilege to be a part of this press corps.</p>
<p>Two questions for you. First, Secretary Blinken said yesterday, I think, during – or maybe on Tuesday, during his Senate testimony, that the upside for Afghan women is that the country has become relatively safer and more stable. We’ve seen yet another bombing in Kabul today. I’m wondering if you have any response to that bombing, and whether or not he stands by that statement.</p>
<p>And then second, if you can provide any update on the effort to return U.S. diplomats to Ukraine. Are they now overnighting in Lviv yet, and does the strike yesterday on Kyiv change that calculus at all? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Conor. So first I’m going to let the Secretary’s comments at his hearing speak for themselves, but what I’ll say from here is that we offer our sincere condolences to the families as well as the loved ones who were killed in these cowardly attacks. The United States condemns these attacks in what appears to be the targeting of members of minority groups in the strongest terms. The United States is also committed to supporting the ability of all Afghans, including members of religious minority groups, to practice their religion freely, without fear of violence against them. We are also extremely concerned about the rise of attacks in Afghanistan and call for an end to these cowardly attacks and for perpetrators to be brought to justice.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-ukraine2"></a> As far as your second question on diplomats in Ukraine, I would say that earlier this week our deputy chief of mission as well as members of our embassy team traveled to Lviv to continue our close collaboration with key partners, and that would include our ministry of foreign affairs of Ukraine. Our diplomats are returning to Ukraine this week on a temporary basis, and we envision more regular travel in the immediate future. Planning is also underway to resume Embassy Kyiv operations as soon as possible.</p>
<p>And then, Conor, if we still have you, just in response to the strike, we’re closely following the reports of yesterday’s strike, and we are also very sad to hear that the strike killed Vera Gyrych of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a Ukrainian Service journalist, and we express our most heartfelt condolences to her family as well as her colleagues. The Kremlin’s war continues to wreak havoc on Ukraine and its people, with dire consequences for those who continue to stand for justice and tell the truth about its brutality.</p>
<p>Let’s go over to Hiba Nasr.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible) the secretary general of Hizballah, Hassan Nasrallah, said, that – threatened that that Iran could attack Israel directly and not through proxies. Do you have concerns over that, or how do you comment on this?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Hiba, if we still have you, can you please repeat your question? The first part of your question was cut off.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes. Today the secretary general of Hizballah, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech that Iran could attack Israel directly and not through proxies. Do you have any comment on that? Do you have concerns also?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Hiba. We don’t have any particular response at this time. But if we have one soon, we’ll be sure to follow up.</p>
<p>Let’s go over to Mariana Sanchez.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you for taking my questions. Can you hear me well?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you, Mariana.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-brazil"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Perfect. So this last week there was this high level with State Department visit in Brazil, and on that I would like to ask some questions. Could you confirm that Brazilian authorities requested help from the Americans with the American nuclear submarine technology, and what the U.S. officials answered concerning this matter?</p>
<p>And the second question, the U.S. authorities said that they are following the electoral process in Brazil and they trust the institutions there. Two days ago the Brazilian president said that the military should be directly involved in counting the votes for the next presidential election. Is the U.S. following these new events, and would the State Department provide any comments on that?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Mariana. So I won’t get into too much of the specifics of the discussions, but I will reiterate that we did have principals recently in the region, our Under Secretary for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland and our Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and Environment Jose Fernandez.</p>
<p>What I will say from here is that shared goals were discussed to protect the environment, mitigation of effects of climate change, recovery from COVID-19, and ways to build supply chain resilience. We also reinforced our cooperation in security and defense, and promoting peace and the rule of law, as well as our appreciation for the vibrant partnership that the United States does share with Brazil.</p>
<p>And as far as your second question on elections, we have nothing specific to offer on – at that time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to the line of Endale Getahun.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Good afternoon, Jalina. Happy Friday to you. I hope you can hear me.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, thank you. Happy Friday to you as well.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-ethiopiaeritrea"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you so much. Thanks so much. I was just wondering if you have read the statement that was made by the Congress Bradley Sherman regarding – based on his tweet that said that he was waiting for the Secretary of State’s promise that he would probably publicly come up and determine for the – regarding the genocide take place in Tigray, Ethiopia or any statement that would be – because said he’s waiting, that the Secretary promised but so far has not made that publicly yet. And so do you have any comment on that?</p>
<p>My also second questions: Do you have any reaction to the Eritrean Government, which has still occupied the western Tigray, including the neighboring Amhara troops or groups in western Tigray? But Eritreans-appointed officials has visited Russia. Possibly there is a negotiation for new military arms for Eritrea and possibly also, according to sources, that the Russians, possibly a warship, could be docked in Red Sea close to Eritrea. As you know, Eritrea is still occupied with Ethiopian authorities and Amhara regime in western Tigray. What’s your reaction on that and if you have those – those are two questions that I have, and thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> So Endale, to your second question, I just don’t have anything to offer on that.</p>
<p>What I would say to your first question on the determination, on the atrocity determination, our position hasn’t changed and we are following the situation in Tigray as well as across northern Ethiopia very closely. We’re also deeply concerned by reported human rights abuses and violations.</p>
<p>In response to these credible reports, we regularly issue statements condemning these incidents and also call for accountability. The Secretary acknowledged to Congressman Sherman on Thursday that the State Department, by law, has the prerogative to issue atrocity determinations and, as a matter of policy, will issue one if and when appropriate.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Jennifer Hansler, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Can you hear me, Jalina?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-ukraine3"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks so much. I wanted to follow up both on Conor and Cindy’s questions.</p>
<p>On Conor’s, can you just confirm how many trips the embassy staff has taken into Ukraine this week? Has it just been the one-day trip or have there been multiple, and are they overnighting at this point yet?</p>
<p>And then I know the State Department doesn’t track the number of Americans who are abroad, but do you have a rough estimate of how many Americans have gone to Ukraine to fight on behalf of the Ukrainian forces there? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> So we don’t have an exact number to preview as far as the trips to Ukraine and overnight. We’ll be happy to share that whenever we do.</p>
<p>And as far as Americans fighting in Ukraine, we don’t have anything to share today on that as well.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Eunjong Cho.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi Jalina, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-ROK"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Wonderful. I have two questions today.</p>
<p>South Korean NGO launched one million leaflets into North Korea by balloon this week, and South Korean Government said it will enforce the anti-leaflet law which bans sending leaflets across the border. What is the State Department’s position on South Korean NGO’s efforts to send leaflets into North Korea?</p>
<p>And then my second question: U.S. think tanks this week released analysis that North Korea is continuing work to restore its nuclear test site. What is State Department’s reaction to North Korea’s continued preparations for a nuclear test? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> So we are aware of reports that the DPRK may be preparing to conduct a nuclear test in the coming months. And such an action not only would be dangerous but it would also be deeply destabilizing to the region. It would blatantly violate international law as set out in multiple resolutions of the UN Security Council. It would also undermine the global nonproliferation regime.</p>
<p>The DPRK has already launched 13 ballistic missiles this year, including at least three ICBMs, and we urge the DPRK to refrain from further destabilizing activity and instead choose to engage in serious and sustained dialogue.</p>
<p>As far as leaflets, we don’t have anything to share at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Alex Raufoglu.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-ukraine4"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, thank you, Jalina, and Happy Friday. Couple of questions here, and let me start with the – your early statement on fallen journalist Vira Hyrych, who worked for a U.S.-backed outlet. Will the State Department be willing to lead the investigation around her death, as well as the deaths of other reporters during this war – be investigated as a war crime?</p>
<p>And my second question is about November G20 summit, whose hosts received confirmation today that President Putin plans to attend. Do you have anything on how Washington will approach that event?</p>
<p>And lastly, any result on meetings at the State Department with Belarus president elect Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya? Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Alex, to your first question, broadly speaking, so evidence of criminality is mounting, and those who have unleashed, perpetrated, and ordered crimes must be held to account. We strongly condemn apparent atrocities by the Kremlin forces across Ukraine. And we’ve assessed that members of Russia’s forces have committed war crimes, and we continue to monitor atrocities being committed in Ukraine.</p>
<p>To your second question on the G20, the United States continues to believe that it can’t be business as usual with regards to Russia’s participation with the international community or international institutions. The G20 president, Indonesia, is responsible for all the invitations, and outside of that we don’t have anything further to announce.</p>
<p>To your last question, we have issued a readout that’s found on our website.</p>
<p>We’ll take our last question from Hyejun So.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I’m not sure if you called my name, but did you call me? Hyejun So?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Yes. Hyejun So.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-rokdprk"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi. Thank you for taking my question. My question is very similar to the previous one from our colleague on North Korea, but it’s a – I saw a report that South Korean military authorities are closely monitoring North Korean military movement, judging from the assessment that there is a high chance of another test firing of missiles, possibly one of the ones that North Korea showed off at their military parade on the 25th. And I’m wondering if this kind of discussion or this kind of South Korean military authority assessment was discussed with U.S. in advance. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>What I would say from here is that we continue to closely monitor the situation on the Korean peninsula, and I’ll just underscore that we urge the DPRK to refrain from further destabilizing activity and instead choose to engage in serious and sustained dialogue.</p>
<p>That concludes today’s briefing. Thank you so much for joining. I hope you have a great weekend ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:29 p.m.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jalina Porter, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-misc"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Good afternoon. Thank you so much for joining today’s press briefing. I just have two updates at the top, and then I will start with taking your questions.</p>
<p>Today marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention, or CWC. For a quarter century, the United States has worked with its allies and partners to help rid the world of chemical weapons and also deter their use by anyone, anywhere, and under any circumstances.</p>
<p>In recent years the world has witnessed chemical weapons use that challenges the CWC’s core prohibitions: by the Assad regime and ISIS in Syria; by Russian Government operatives against the Skripals in the UK and Aleksey Navalny in Russia; and by the DPRK against Kim Jong Nam in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Syria remains in non-compliance with the CWC, and we will continue to work to hold the Assad regime accountable for its repeated use of chemical weapons against its own people.</p>
<p>We will also continue our efforts to hold the Kremlin accountable for its non-compliance with the CWC, repeated use of chemical weapons, and ongoing efforts to shield the Assad regime from accountability for its chemical weapons use. Furthermore, we will continue to closely monitor for the possible use of chemical munitions by Russian forces in Ukraine.</p>
<p>On this anniversary we renew our commitment to upholding the CWC, and also note the convention’s important role in contributing to U.S. national security.</p>
<p>And I’ll take a point of personal privilege to just acknowledge our State Department reporter colleague, Conor Finnegan of ABC. Conor, if you’re on, or even if you aren’t, I hope you get this message. We know this is your last day. I just want to take a moment to say thank you for all of your contributions, for your insightful and fair and consistent reporting. We certainly will miss you here, and wish you the very best on your next chapter.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Cindy Saine.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-ukraine"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Could you please confirm a report that American citizen and former U.S. Marine Willy Joseph Cancel was killed in Ukraine, fighting along Ukrainian forces? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Cindy. Well, we are aware of these reports, and certainly stand ready to provide all possible consular assistance to the family. However, out of respect to the family during this very difficult time, we don’t have anything further to announce.</p>
<p>We also do want to reiterate that U.S. citizens should not travel to Ukraine during this active armed conflict. It is a very dangerous situation – and the singling out of U.S. citizens in Ukraine by Russian Government security officials, and that U.S. citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately, if it is safe to do so using commercial or privately available ground transportation options.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Matt Lee, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong> Hi, Matt. Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-nepal"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hey. Okay. I got two things, both brief. Yesterday, the Secretary when he was on the Hill was asked about this Chinese memory chip company, YMTC, and whether it is violating laws that provide the – laws against providing technology to Huawei and others. He did not have an answer. I’m wondering if you guys have looked into it and do have an answer now and, if you do, what that is.</p>
<p>And the second thing is are you aware of an incident in Nepal recently, where you – in relation to a custody – child custody case. U.S. Embassy guards or officials were assaulted. I believe this happened on the 16th. Anyway, are you – this involves a child who was apparently abducted to Nepal by one of her parents. And anyway, I know that you probably won’t be able to talk about that because of privacy, but I want to know if you have anything on the assault on embassy officials. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks. I’ll start with your second question. So the State Department is aware of reports of an alleged child abduction case in Nepal involving a U.S. citizen, and we are providing all appropriate consular assistance.</p>
<p>To your point on assaults on staff, I am just now learning about that in real time, so I don’t have anything to offer.

They’re also extremely complex, and we’re committed to doing everything that we can to assist in resolving these challenging cases.</p>
<p>To your first question, we don’t have anything to offer, but we’re certainly happy to take that back to the team and get you any updates as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Let’s go to the line of Laura Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible) for taking my question. I hope you can hear me.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you, Laura.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-georgia"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, thank you. Have any State Department officials met with Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili while she’s here in Washington? And is the State Department concerned that Russian threats to Georgia pose a risk to the U.S. interests in the region? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Laura. I don’t have any meetings to read out at this time, but what I can say from here on Georgia: from the beginning, the American people have stood in solidarity with the people of Georgia and their desire to be a free and sovereign country. Over the years we’ve also developed into strategic partners working together towards our shared vision of Georgia fully integrated into the Euro-Atlantic family of nations, and as a part of a Europe whole, free, and at peace.</p>
<p>Let’s go over to Conor Finnegan, please.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-afghanistan"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Jalina, thank you for your generous words. It’s been a privilege to be a part of this press corps.</p>
<p>Two questions for you. First, Secretary Blinken said yesterday, I think, during – or maybe on Tuesday, during his Senate testimony, that the upside for Afghan women is that the country has become relatively safer and more stable. We’ve seen yet another bombing in Kabul today. I’m wondering if you have any response to that bombing, and whether or not he stands by that statement.</p>
<p>And then second, if you can provide any update on the effort to return U.S. diplomats to Ukraine. Are they now overnighting in Lviv yet, and does the strike yesterday on Kyiv change that calculus at all? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Conor. So first I’m going to let the Secretary’s comments at his hearing speak for themselves, but what I’ll say from here is that we offer our sincere condolences to the families as well as the loved ones who were killed in these cowardly attacks. The United States condemns these attacks in what appears to be the targeting of members of minority groups in the strongest terms. The United States is also committed to supporting the ability of all Afghans, including members of religious minority groups, to practice their religion freely, without fear of violence against them. We are also extremely concerned about the rise of attacks in Afghanistan and call for an end to these cowardly attacks and for perpetrators to be brought to justice.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-ukraine2"></a> As far as your second question on diplomats in Ukraine, I would say that earlier this week our deputy chief of mission as well as members of our embassy team traveled to Lviv to continue our close collaboration with key partners, and that would include our ministry of foreign affairs of Ukraine. Our diplomats are returning to Ukraine this week on a temporary basis, and we envision more regular travel in the immediate future. Planning is also underway to resume Embassy Kyiv operations as soon as possible.</p>
<p>And then, Conor, if we still have you, just in response to the strike, we’re closely following the reports of yesterday’s strike, and we are also very sad to hear that the strike killed Vera Gyrych of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a Ukrainian Service journalist, and we express our most heartfelt condolences to her family as well as her colleagues. The Kremlin’s war continues to wreak havoc on Ukraine and its people, with dire consequences for those who continue to stand for justice and tell the truth about its brutality.</p>
<p>Let’s go over to Hiba Nasr.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible) the secretary general of Hizballah, Hassan Nasrallah, said, that – threatened that that Iran could attack Israel directly and not through proxies. Do you have concerns over that, or how do you comment on this?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Hiba, if we still have you, can you please repeat your question? The first part of your question was cut off.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes. Today the secretary general of Hizballah, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech that Iran could attack Israel directly and not through proxies. Do you have any comment on that? Do you have concerns also?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Hiba. We don’t have any particular response at this time. But if we have one soon, we’ll be sure to follow up.</p>
<p>Let’s go over to Mariana Sanchez.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you for taking my questions. Can you hear me well?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you, Mariana.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-brazil"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Perfect. So this last week there was this high level with State Department visit in Brazil, and on that I would like to ask some questions. Could you confirm that Brazilian authorities requested help from the Americans with the American nuclear submarine technology, and what the U.S. officials answered concerning this matter?</p>
<p>And the second question, the U.S. authorities said that they are following the electoral process in Brazil and they trust the institutions there. Two days ago the Brazilian president said that the military should be directly involved in counting the votes for the next presidential election. Is the U.S. following these new events, and would the State Department provide any comments on that?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Mariana. So I won’t get into too much of the specifics of the discussions, but I will reiterate that we did have principals recently in the region, our Under Secretary for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland and our Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and Environment Jose Fernandez.</p>
<p>What I will say from here is that shared goals were discussed to protect the environment, mitigation of effects of climate change, recovery from COVID-19, and ways to build supply chain resilience. We also reinforced our cooperation in security and defense, and promoting peace and the rule of law, as well as our appreciation for the vibrant partnership that the United States does share with Brazil.</p>
<p>And as far as your second question on elections, we have nothing specific to offer on – at that time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to the line of Endale Getahun.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Good afternoon, Jalina. Happy Friday to you. I hope you can hear me.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, thank you. Happy Friday to you as well.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-ethiopiaeritrea"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you so much. Thanks so much. I was just wondering if you have read the statement that was made by the Congress Bradley Sherman regarding – based on his tweet that said that he was waiting for the Secretary of State’s promise that he would probably publicly come up and determine for the – regarding the genocide take place in Tigray, Ethiopia or any statement that would be – because said he’s waiting, that the Secretary promised but so far has not made that publicly yet. And so do you have any comment on that?</p>
<p>My also second questions: Do you have any reaction to the Eritrean Government, which has still occupied the western Tigray, including the neighboring Amhara troops or groups in western Tigray? But Eritreans-appointed officials has visited Russia. Possibly there is a negotiation for new military arms for Eritrea and possibly also, according to sources, that the Russians, possibly a warship, could be docked in Red Sea close to Eritrea. As you know, Eritrea is still occupied with Ethiopian authorities and Amhara regime in western Tigray. What’s your reaction on that and if you have those – those are two questions that I have, and thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> So Endale, to your second question, I just don’t have anything to offer on that.</p>
<p>What I would say to your first question on the determination, on the atrocity determination, our position hasn’t changed and we are following the situation in Tigray as well as across northern Ethiopia very closely. We’re also deeply concerned by reported human rights abuses and violations.</p>
<p>In response to these credible reports, we regularly issue statements condemning these incidents and also call for accountability. The Secretary acknowledged to Congressman Sherman on Thursday that the State Department, by law, has the prerogative to issue atrocity determinations and, as a matter of policy, will issue one if and when appropriate.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Jennifer Hansler, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Can you hear me, Jalina?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-ukraine3"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks so much. I wanted to follow up both on Conor and Cindy’s questions.</p>
<p>On Conor’s, can you just confirm how many trips the embassy staff has taken into Ukraine this week? Has it just been the one-day trip or have there been multiple, and are they overnighting at this point yet?</p>
<p>And then I know the State Department doesn’t track the number of Americans who are abroad, but do you have a rough estimate of how many Americans have gone to Ukraine to fight on behalf of the Ukrainian forces there? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> So we don’t have an exact number to preview as far as the trips to Ukraine and overnight. We’ll be happy to share that whenever we do.</p>
<p>And as far as Americans fighting in Ukraine, we don’t have anything to share today on that as well.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Eunjong Cho.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi Jalina, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-ROK"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Wonderful. I have two questions today.</p>
<p>South Korean NGO launched one million leaflets into North Korea by balloon this week, and South Korean Government said it will enforce the anti-leaflet law which bans sending leaflets across the border. What is the State Department’s position on South Korean NGO’s efforts to send leaflets into North Korea?</p>
<p>And then my second question: U.S. think tanks this week released analysis that North Korea is continuing work to restore its nuclear test site. What is State Department’s reaction to North Korea’s continued preparations for a nuclear test? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> So we are aware of reports that the DPRK may be preparing to conduct a nuclear test in the coming months. And such an action not only would be dangerous but it would also be deeply destabilizing to the region. It would blatantly violate international law as set out in multiple resolutions of the UN Security Council. It would also undermine the global nonproliferation regime.</p>
<p>The DPRK has already launched 13 ballistic missiles this year, including at least three ICBMs, and we urge the DPRK to refrain from further destabilizing activity and instead choose to engage in serious and sustained dialogue.</p>
<p>As far as leaflets, we don’t have anything to share at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Alex Raufoglu.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-ukraine4"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, thank you, Jalina, and Happy Friday. Couple of questions here, and let me start with the – your early statement on fallen journalist Vira Hyrych, who worked for a U.S.-backed outlet. Will the State Department be willing to lead the investigation around her death, as well as the deaths of other reporters during this war – be investigated as a war crime?</p>
<p>And my second question is about November G20 summit, whose hosts received confirmation today that President Putin plans to attend. Do you have anything on how Washington will approach that event?</p>
<p>And lastly, any result on meetings at the State Department with Belarus president elect Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya? Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Alex, to your first question, broadly speaking, so evidence of criminality is mounting, and those who have unleashed, perpetrated, and ordered crimes must be held to account. We strongly condemn apparent atrocities by the Kremlin forces across Ukraine. And we’ve assessed that members of Russia’s forces have committed war crimes, and we continue to monitor atrocities being committed in Ukraine.</p>
<p>To your second question on the G20, the United States continues to believe that it can’t be business as usual with regards to Russia’s participation with the international community or international institutions. The G20 president, Indonesia, is responsible for all the invitations, and outside of that we don’t have anything further to announce.</p>
<p>To your last question, we have issued a readout that’s found on our website.</p>
<p>We’ll take our last question from Hyejun So.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I’m not sure if you called my name, but did you call me? Hyejun So?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Yes. Hyejun So.</p>
<p><a id="post-339666-rokdprk"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi. Thank you for taking my question. My question is very similar to the previous one from our colleague on North Korea, but it’s a – I saw a report that South Korean military authorities are closely monitoring North Korean military movement, judging from the assessment that there is a high chance of another test firing of missiles, possibly one of the ones that North Korea showed off at their military parade on the 25th. And I’m wondering if this kind of discussion or this kind of South Korean military authority assessment was discussed with U.S. in advance. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>What I would say from here is that we continue to closely monitor the situation on the Korean peninsula, and I’ll just underscore that we urge the DPRK to refrain from further destabilizing activity and instead choose to engage in serious and sustained dialogue.</p>
<p>That concludes today’s briefing. Thank you so much for joining. I hope you have a great weekend ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:29 p.m.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Today marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  For a quarter of a century, the United States has worked with its Allies and partners to help rid the world of chemical weapons and deter their use by anyone, anywhere, and under any circumstances.  Our collective goal is to exclude completely the possibility of the use of chemical weapons, which are abhorrent tools of war.  On this anniversary, we renew our commitment to upholding the CWC and note the Convention’s important role in contributing to U.S. national security.  Unfortunately, this anniversary reminds us that the world continues to be threatened by the specter of these weapons.</p>
<p>In recent years, the world has witnessed chemical weapons use that challenges the CWC’s core prohibitions: by the Assad regime and ISIS in Syria, by Russian government operatives against the Skripals in the UK and Aleksey Navalny in Russia, and by the DPRK against Kim Jong Nam in Malaysia.  Syria remains in noncompliance with the CWC, and we will continue to work to hold the Assad regime accountable for its repeated use of chemical weapons against its own people.  We will also continue our efforts to hold the Kremlin accountable for its noncompliance with the CWC, repeated use of chemical weapons, and ongoing efforts to shield the Assad regime from accountability for its CW use.  Further, we have made very clear that the Russian government would face profound consequences were it to use chemical weapons in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the Convention, which President Biden has championed since his time in the U.S. Senate, has shown time and again its utility, demonstrated by the commitment of the majority of States Parties to compliance and their willingness to take actions to uphold it and hold accountable those who violate it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Rayburn House Office Building</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Chairman Meeks, Ranking Member McCaul, thank you.  Thank you for having me here today to speak about the administration’s proposed budget for the State Department, but thank you more broadly &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR CHABOT:</strong>  Secretary, could you pull the mike a little closer, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Yes, sorry.  That better?  Let me try that.</p>
<p>But thank you as well for your partnership and also for your leadership.  That CODEL that both of you led in Poland at a critical moment made a big difference, and it’s been gratifying to be able to work with both of you and other members on this urgent issue but also on many others.  And I deeply appreciate it.</p>
<p>And I did recently get back from Kyiv with Secretary Austin, where we wanted to show as well as deliver on America’s commitment to the Government and to the people of Ukraine.  This brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has underscored to me the power and the purpose of American diplomacy.  Our diplomacy is rallying allies and partners around the world to join us in supporting Ukraine with security, economic, humanitarian assistance, to impose massive costs on Russia for its aggression, to strengthen our collective security and defense, and to address the war’s mounting global consequences, including the refugee and food crises that have flown from it.</p>
<p>We have to continue to drive this diplomacy forward, also to seize the strategic opportunities and address some of the risks that are presented by Russia’s overreach as countries reconsider their policies, their priorities, their relationships.</p>
<p>The budget request before you predates the crisis, but fully funding it and the new emergency resources that the President requested earlier today is critical to ensuring that Russia’s war in Ukraine is a strategic failure for the Kremlin and serves as a powerful lesson to those who might consider following its path.</p>
<p>The supplemental resources Congress provided in March have made a decisive difference on the battlefield, helping Ukrainians defend their country and win the battle for Kyiv.  Your support also helped meet the mounting costs caused by the Kremlin’s brutal invasion in Ukraine itself, across Europe, around the world, while bolstering the security of our allies and partners.</p>
<p>This assistance was provided with broad bipartisan support and sent a clear signal of the United States commitment to the Ukrainian Government and to its people.  We ask that Congress do the same with the emergency request that’s before you as of today, which seeks $20.5 billion for security assistance, $8.5 billion for economic assistance, and $3 billion for humanitarian aid, including to address the growing global food security crisis, which is a direct result of Russia’s aggression.  Approximately $14 billion of this request would be directed to the State Department and to USAID.</p>
<p>Let me just underscore: We can’t take our progress so far for granted.  Ukraine’s enduring independence and sovereignty depends in no small part on ensuring that the country’s brave defenders have what they need to keep up the fight and meet the urgent needs of their people.</p>
<p>But Mr. Chairman, to your point, as we focus on this urgent crisis, the State Department continues to carry out missions that are front and center to our diplomacy, like responsibly managing great power competition with China, facilitating a halt to fighting in Yemen and Ethiopia, pushing back against the rising tide of authoritarianism and the threat that it poses to democracy and human rights.</p>
<p>We also have evolving challenges that require us to develop new capabilities, like the emergence and re-emergence of infectious disease, an accelerating climate crisis, a digital revolution that holds enormous promise but also real peril.</p>
<p>Last fall, I had a chance to set out a modernization agenda for the department and for U.S. diplomacy to enable us to even more effectively respond to many of these complex demands.  And in no small part thanks to the FY22 budget approved by Congress, we’ve been able to make real progress on this agenda, though much remains to be done.</p>
<p>To give just a few quick examples, we’ve strengthened our capacity to shape the ongoing technological revolution so that it actually protects our interests, it boosts American competitiveness, it upholds our values.  With bipartisan Congressional support and encouragement, we just launched a new bureau for cyberspace and digital policy, with 60 team members to start.  And I am grateful for the support and the advice that we got along the way.</p>
<p>We’re also making headway on ensuring our diplomats reflect America’s remarkable diversity.  This is a tremendous source of strength for our diplomacy.  The department’s first ever chief diversity and inclusion officer has spearheaded an effort to analyze and address the obstacles that have been preventing under-represented groups from joining but also advancing at the State Department.  We’ve expanded the Pickering and Rangel fellowship programs and, Mr. Chairman, as you said, paid internships at State, again with strong Congressional input and support.</p>
<p>My first 15 months on this job have only strengthened my conviction that these and other reforms aren’t just worthwhile, they’re essential to delivering for the American people.</p>
<p>Ensuring we can deliver on this agenda will require sustained funding, some new authorities, and most importantly, partnership from Congress.  That’s why I’m grateful to have worked with Congress to re-establish a formal dialogue on the State Department authorization.  Last month, we sent congressional staff the first package of legislative authorities required to meet the challenges we face, and we expect to send more in the coming weeks and to working with you on State authorization.</p>
<p>If we want to deepen our capability in key areas like climate and multilateral diplomacy; if we want to expand on Secretary Powell’s vision of a Foreign Service training float; if we want to strengthen global health security and the capacity to prevent, to detect, and respond to future outbreaks – we’ll need some additional resources.</p>
<p>If we want to be able to swiftly stand up new missions, to deploy our diplomats when and where they’re needed, and make these decisions based on risk management, not risk aversion, we’ll need to reform the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act.</p>
<p>There are other things that I would point to that we need to do, but we look forward to working with you on that.</p>
<p>So in the interest of time, let me stop there.  And of course, we can address these and many other issues throughout the course of the testimony.  Thank you.  Very good to be with everyone.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Jessica Stern, U.S. Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex (LGBTQI+) PersonsBureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE: </b> Well, good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you very much for joining us.  And I’m especially pleased to introduce Jessica Stern – as you know, she’s our Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ persons – on this momentous occasion.</p>
<p>As you know, the administration has placed human rights at the center of our foreign policy.  And a year ago, in February of last year, President Biden issued his Memorandum on Advancing Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the World.  And last June, he appointed Jessica to this very important position.  And now today, Special Envoy Stern is with us to unveil the <a href="https://www.state.gov/lgbtqi-human-rights/">first annual interagency report</a> on the implementation of the Presidential Memorandum.  This is a product reflecting a whole-of-government approach, led by the State Department.</p>
<p>And Special Envoy Stern will offer brief remarks and then will have an opportunity to take some of your questions.  So without further ado, I will turn it over to the Special Envoy.</p>
<p><b>MS STERN:</b>  Thank you, Ned, for the very kind introduction.  And good afternoon to everyone, if it’s afternoon where you are, or hello if you’re in a different time zone.</p>
<p>As Ned noted, in his first weeks in office, President Biden signed a Presidential Memorandum entitled, quote, “Advancing the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the World.”  This memorandum makes clear that promoting and protecting the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons is a U.S. foreign policy priority.</p>
<p>And today, I’m really happy to talk to you about the first interagency report, outlining how the U.S. Government has worked collectively towards fulfilling the memorandum’s goals.</p>
<p>This is a historic first for the United States.  The report outlines how U.S. Government agencies engaged abroad are working to become more LGBTQI+-inclusive.  And it shows that many individual actions across the U.S. Government, taken together as a whole, create institutional change and improve the daily lives of LGBTQI+ persons.  The report highlights the progress that is possible when we actively reach out to other governments, multilateral institutions, and civil society.</p>
<p>This work is essential, because LGBTQI+ persons face violence, stigma, lack of access to basic services, and, in approximately 70 countries, criminalization of their status or behavior.  And in many places, LGBTQI+ persons are targeted as a way of undermining democracy itself.</p>
<p>Through determined diplomacy and targeted foreign assistance, the United States is combating the criminalization of LGBTQI+ status or conduct, promoting protection of vulnerable LGBTQI+ refugees and asylum seekers, responding to human rights abuses committed against LGBTQI+ persons, strengthening relationships with like-minded governments, engaging international organizations on the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons, and working to rescind policies inconsistent with our nation’s values.</p>
<p>So that being said, I want to highlight several successes, starting with the Department of State, which set a historic precedent as the first federal government agency to offer the X gender marker on an identity document by providing, as of April 11th, the X gender marker as an option on U.S. passport applications. The X signifies unspecified or another gender identity.</p>
<p>The Department of State also launched a flagship program as part of the Biden administration’s Presidential Initiative for Democracy Renewal – the Global LGBTQI+ Inclusive Democracy and Empowerment Initiative, also known as GLIDE, that seeks to ensure democracies are inclusive of LGBTQI+ persons, representative of their communities and families, and responsive to their needs and concerns.  The new initiative builds on the track record of success under the Global Equality Fund, which has provided over $100 million in financial support to protect and promote the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons in more than 100 countries since its inception.</p>
<p>The Department of State also led the successful expansion of a United Nations resolution on elections to include sexual orientation and gender identity, becoming only the second resolution in the history of the General Assembly to do so and the very first via consensus.</p>
<p>From the Department of State, I want to move on to the Peace Corps, where approximately 60 percent of Peace Corps posts reported implementing specific LGBTQI+ equity practices within their operations, like hosting LGBTQI+ human rights organizations to inform in-country strategy and volunteer placement.</p>
<p>From there, we move on to the Department of Health and Human Services, which now ensures that its Notice of Funding Award Guidance includes clear guidance to support nondiscrimination.</p>
<p>And then on to USAID, which reinstated a reporting mechanism to track overall foreign assistance which advances LGBTQI+ human rights.</p>
<p>And next onto the Department of Treasury, which is pursuing how to win shareholder support to promote strengthened safeguard protections for LGBTQI+ persons and how to foster stronger multilateral development bank implementation of existing safeguard policies for LGBTQI+ persons.</p>
<p>And then my last example for you comes from the Department of Homeland Security, which issued revised guidance to recognize informal same-sex marriages for the purposes of obtaining refugee or asylee status, even if they are not officially recognized by officials in countries of origin.</p>
<p>And as I draw towards my conclusion, I just want to say our work has only just begun, and throughout my time serving as the U.S. Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons – which I think is the longest title in the State Department, but Ned can correct me if I’m wrong – I have found that colleagues at the Department of State and really at each agency to be eager and ready to advance the cause of protecting and promoting the dignity, inclusion, and human rights of every LGBTQI+ person.  And simply put, in the darkest places, we are finding the brightest lights.  Thank you.</p>
<p>And with that, I’m happy to take your questions.  Back to you, Ned.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:  </b>Thanks very much.  It’s a long title but – and a very important one, an important position.  Operator, do you mind repeating the instructions to ask a question?</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:  </b>Thank you.  And ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your touchtone phone.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:  </b>We’ll give it just a moment for people to filter into the queue.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:  </b>Again, if you do have a question, please press a 1 then 0.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:  </b>We’ll go to the line of Bianca Hillier, please.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Hello, can you hear me?</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:  </b>Yes.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Hi.  Thank you so much, Special Envoy Stern, for speaking with us today.  I have a question:  What did those informal marriages to refugees and asylum seekers grant those people the ability to do?  How directly does that help people?  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS STERN:  </b>Hi, Bianca.  I’ve followed your work but never met you.  Great to hear your voice.</p>
<p>It was a fact that stood out to me when I read the report as well, because I think it’s really significant.  As you’re probably aware, in approximately 70 countries worldwide, homosexual status or conduct is criminalized.  And the number of countries globally that have any form of recognition of equal marriage, civil unions, or family recognition in other forms for LGBTQI couples is few and far between.</p>
<p>So although I’m not versed in the technical specifications of the DHS policy, I can tell you this is a very important form of recognition.  And what it means is that for the sake of LGBTQI couples and their families, who have no access to legal recognition by their own government, the United States is recognizing grounds of persecution on the basis of sexual orientation and recognizing that their families are valid and valuable.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:  </b>Great.  We’ll give it just another moment.  If anyone else wishes to ask a question, please raise your hand now.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:  </b>And again, if you do have a question, please press 1 0.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:  </b> Okay.  Well, seeing no additional questions, I want to thank the Special Envoy.  I want to thank all of you for joining today’s call.  For those of you who have questions you wish to ask offline, I think you know how to contact us.  Please do reach out and we’d be happy to work with you from there.  Thank you very much.  Have a good day.</p>
<p><b>MS STERN:  </b>Thank you.</p>
