					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The text of the following statement was released by the G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union.</p>
<p><i>Begin Text.</i></p>
<p>We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, express our strongest opposition and deplore the increasing restrictions imposed on the rights and freedoms of women and girls in Afghanistan by the Taliban.</p>
<p>We stand with the Afghan people in their demand for equal rights in line with the Taliban’s commitments to all Afghans and Afghanistan’s obligations under international law. We condemn the imposition of increasingly restrictive measures that severely limit half the population’s ability to fully, equally, and meaningfully participate in society, including the recent announcement on women’s appearance in public along with new punishments for family members to enforce compliance with these restrictions.</p>
<p>With these moves, the Taliban are further isolating themselves from the international community. Echoing our joint statement, together with Norway, from March 24, we call on the Taliban to urgently take steps to lift restrictions on women and girls, respect their human rights, and meet the expectations of Afghans and the world to permit their full, equal, and meaningful participation in work, education and public life, as well as freedom of movement and freedom of speech, which is crucial for long-term peace, stability and development of the country.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Treaty Room</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It’s a really great pleasure to welcome my colleague, my friend, the deputy prime minister, Don here to the State Department in Washington.  I’m particularly eager to continue the very good conversations we started in the fall.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER PRAMUDWINAI:</b>  Yes.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  We were supposed to continue them during a trip that I was making to Thailand.  Unfortunately, that was – that trip was shortened by COVID.  This meeting was almost shortened by COVID, but happily I’m back in time to receive my friend.</p>
<p>This is a momentous week with the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit, and we’re gratified to have Thailand here in Washington for that.  Also in your leadership year of APEC, which we’ll be taking on &#8212;</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER PRAMUDWINAI:</b>  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  &#8212; after you finish.  But a very strong shared agenda for a stable, peaceful Indo-Pacific that we’ll be working on.  We just came off of the first joint Strategic and Defense Dialogue between our countries, that I think was very successful, and I welcome you here to pursue the conversations we’ve been having.  Welcome.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER PRAMUDWINAI:</b>  Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, very nice to see you, members of the press, for the second time.  The first time was when I was here bilaterally, but this time around it was for the ASEAN 45th anniversary, a special leaders meeting.  But I’m glad I’m part of it, and then we can continue where we left off last time.</p>
<p>You mentioned about APEC.  Yes, definitely, we will be hosting it in November, and then you will take over chairmanship.</p>
<p>We have a lot more things to talk about, including the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.</p>
<p>So let me assure that this encounter that we are having now will be much more productive than last time.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good.  Thank you.  Thank you, everyone.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER PRAMUDWINAI:</b>  Thank you, everyone.</p>
