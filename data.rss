					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Brussels Media Hub</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  And joining us now, the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.  Mr. Secretary, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks, Chris.  It’s great to be with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  This trip is building up to I guess the climax, the meeting with Russian President Putin in Geneva on Wednesday.  Here’s what Putin said this week about relations between the U.S. and Russia.  Take a look:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(Via interpreter) “We have a bilateral relationship that has deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you agree that relations between the U.S. and Russia are at the lowest point in recent years?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, that may be the one thing that I’d agree with President Putin on.  And one of the things that President Biden will begin to test is whether Russia is interested in a more stable, predictable relationship, which would be to everyone’s benefit.  But if not – if it continues to take reckless and aggressive actions directed at us or our allies and partners – the President’s going to make clear that we’ll respond forcefully, as we did in the case of election interference, the SolarWinds cyber hack, the attempt to murder Mr. Navalny.  So this is the beginning of testing the proposition about whether Russia wants a more stable, predictable relationship itself and whether, in some areas where there’s mutual interest, we can find some ways to cooperate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  When the President arrived in Europe earlier this week, he was pretty general about the message he intends to convey to Mr. Putin.  Take a look at what he said then:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then to meet with Mr. Putin to let him know what I want him to know.”  (Applause.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let’s get more specific.  Putin just said or it was reported that he said this morning that he’s willing to hand over cyber criminals to the U.S. if we hand over cyber criminals we’re harboring to him.  Is that a satisfactory resolution to the ransomware problem?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Chris, I don’t want to get ahead of the President, but let me say this:  When it comes to ransomware, no responsible country should be in the business of harboring criminal organizations engaged in those practices.  And that is something that the President very much intends to take up with President Putin.  That’s very much on the agenda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  But what can he do about it, Mr. Secretary?  I mean, I know he can say there are these gangs, they’re shutting down our pipelines, they’re shutting down our food supply.  But other than complaining about it, what can the President do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Look, let me take one step back for a second.  We’re not coming into – the President’s not coming into this meeting with President Putin in a void.  We’re coming off of a G7 summit, a NATO summit, a meeting with the EU leadership.  And what we’re demonstrating in each of these meetings and summits is that democracies can come together and work effectively to actually deliver results for our people and, by the way, for people around the world.  And also, when we’re working together militarily, economically, diplomatically, politically, we’re a very powerful force.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a major poll that just came out that showed that across those countries, 75 percent of the people on average now have confidence in American leadership and in President Biden.  That’s up from 17 percent a year ago.  So we’re now in a position where, when it comes to dealing with Russia and the challenges it poses or dealing with China and the challenges it poses, we can come with a much more united front.  And so I think you’ll see – and again, I’m not going to get ahead of the President, but when it comes to looking for action to deal with things like ransomware, we’re in a stronger position with tools of our own and the international community with us to elicit that action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Why did the President decide to hold a solo news conference after his summit with Putin on Wednesday as opposed to the joint press conferences that he usually holds with foreign leaders and the joint press conference that President Trump and Putin held after their summit in 2018?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Chris, I think it’s the most effective way for the President to be able to talk with the free press and to share for as long as he can what was discussed in the meeting with President Putin, as well as to cover the entire week, to talk about what we’ve accomplished over the course of the G7, the NATO meetings, the EU meetings.  By the way, he’s doing a solo press conference I think almost right now in the UK after the G7, so this is not a rare practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  One of the President’s main objectives on this trip is to get the allies – both the G7, the EU, NATO – to join together – I guess not NATO, but the others to join together in calling out China for dumping its exports at unfair trade – unfair low prices, and also to call out China for human rights abuses.  Now, I know there’s a communique, but I want to ask you the practical effect.  Have the U.S. and the allies agreed that they are going to condemn forced labor, for instance by the Uyghurs?  Have they agreed that they’re going to go to the WTO and ask for duties on China for dumping exports?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  First, Chris, it’s important in and of itself that the communique, this document that comes out of the G7 and talks about what the G7 leaders have agreed on – it’s important in and of itself that there’s a focus on China.  Go back to 2018, the last time these leaders came together – no mention of China in the document summing up what the G7 was focused on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, we had very detailed discussions about the kind of work that could be done, the kind of actions that could be taken, for example, in preventing the export of products made with forced labor in China or, for that matter, preventing the export of products that could be used to repress people in China.  All of that was on the table, and I think you can expect to see going forward different countries taking action across those areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one other thing that’s really important – I just want to spend a second on it – one of the things that the leaders agreed to was this so-called Build Back Better for the World, and that is an agreement to work to start to pool all of our resources, our development resources; make investments in low and middle-income countries; get the private sector to make these investments, to build up their health care systems, infrastructure, technology, which will be strong markets for our products; but to do it in a way that’s a race to the top, not the bottom, in terms of the standards, in terms of respect for workers, for the environment, for privacy, all of these things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a very powerful positive alternative to what China is doing with its so-called Belt and Road Initiative.  We’re demonstrating that we have &#8212;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  There’s also &#8212;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  &#8212; a positive alternative vision in the – for the future and bringing countries along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  There’s also the continuing controversy over the origins of COVID.  I know the President has ordered this 90-day review of U.S. intelligence on what we know, but one assumes if we knew anything, we’d already know it.  And I guess the more important question is what is the President prepared to do unilaterally – not through the WHO, which has already been stiffed by the Chinese – what is he prepared to do unilaterally to press China to provide, to share more evidence, more information, especially from the Wuhan lab?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, first, Chris, your – the premise of your question is entirely correct, which is we need to get to the bottom of what happened.  We need accountability, but we also need to understand what happened, why it happened, how it happened if we’re going to be able to put in place the necessary measures to prevent it from happening again, or at least to be in a better place to mitigate the next pandemic if we can’t fully prevent one.  And so we need this transparency; we need this information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The WHO, you’re right – the first study that they put out was highly deficient.  The leaders of the G7 have come together insisting that China cooperate with the so-called Phase 2 study by the WHO to really get to the bottom of what happened, but that is – that’s not enough.  The President ordered this 90-day sprint.  We looked at this very hard.  He ordered back in March that we try to determine for ourselves the origins of the – of COVID-19, and we came up with two plausible explanations.  One is the so-called natural occurrence, going from animal to human; the other was a lab leak.  But we couldn’t determine with any degree of certainty which one it was.  What the President’s ordered now is to – with the Intelligence Community, bringing all of the different agencies of government and also our national labs, other experts, bringing all of that expertise to bear to look at every piece of information we have to see if we can make a determination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, the thing that is most critical besides accountability is, again, making sure that every country, including China, cooperates with the international community in making sure we have the transparency, we have access for experts in real time, we have information sharing so that if something starts to percolate again, we’re on top of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Finally, your immediate predecessor, Secretary Pompeo, is waiting on the wings.  He’s going to be coming up in the next segment.  Briefly, what would you tell him is the biggest difference between Biden foreign policy and Trump foreign policy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Chris, I’m resolutely looking forward, not backward.  Please say hello to Mike.  We’ve had a lot of good conversations and I look forward to the next one, but we’re focused on the future, moving forward.  We’ve had a very good couple of days with the G7 in actually demonstrating that democracies can come together and deliver for people in real ways, real outcomes – a billion shots in arms, that’s remarkable – dealing more effectively with climate change, prohibiting financing of coal-fired plants, which is the biggest single contributor to emissions; this Build back Better for the World that I talked about; the 15 percent global corporate minimum tax that’s going to give countries around the world a stronger tax base, stronger markets for us, ultimately.  So that’s what we’re focused on, as well as strengthening NATO and working with the EU and dealing with Mr. Putin.  So please say hi to Mike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  That is a very diplomatic answer for the Secretary of State.  Secretary Blinken, thank you.  Thanks for your time in the midst of the President’s trip, and please come back, sir.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Brussels Media Hub</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Joining me now is the U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken.  Thank you so much for joining me.  Let me first ask about one of President Biden’s key goals in this summit – uniting the Western democracies around countering China’s influence, especially around the goal of building infrastructure around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the White House has not said yet that the U.S. allies are onboard for financial support, so do you have a deal on that?  Is there money behind it?  And if so, how much?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, first, Dana, just to take a step back, the President came into this meeting of the G7 determined to show that democracies can deliver, deliver for their people, deliver for people around the world.  And that’s exactly what we’ve done over the last couple of days, and I’ll come to the specific point in a second. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a commitment to a billion vaccines to put shots in arms around the world, that’s a powerful demonstration of democracies delivering; a commitment to deal with and to stop financing coal-fired plants and projects around the world, the single largest contributor to emissions and to global warming; a 15 percent minimum global corporate tax, making sure that countries around the world have a strong tax base to provide for their citizens, provide better – new markets for us as well, and avoid a race to the bottom.  And yes, this project to pool our resources, our – to invest in low and middle-income countries, to get to the private sector to do the same so that we can help them build up their infrastructure, their health care systems, education, and do it in a more positive way than China is doing it with its Belt and Road Initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So they’ve launched this project.  Our experts are going to come together over the coming months and we’ll look at the resources necessary to do that.  But individually, our countries can only do so much.  When we put all of these resources together and when we leverage the private sector, it’s a very powerful force, and we’ve got an agreement to move forward on that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Let’s look ahead to President Biden’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin that’s going to be on Wednesday in Geneva.  I know the President plans to confront him on human rights, on Ukraine, on recent cyber attacks.  How do you define success out of this meeting?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Dana, this is not going to be a flip-the-light-switch moment.  What the President is going to make clear to President Putin is that we seek a more stable, predictable relationship with Russia, and if so, there are areas where our interests overlap, and we may be able to find ways to work together.  But if Russia chooses to continue reckless and aggressive actions, we will respond forcefully, as the President has already demonstrated that he would when it comes to election interference or the SolarWinds cyber attack or the attempt to murder Mr. Navalny with a chemical weapon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this is a beginning of testing the proposition, the question of whether Russia is interested in a more stable and predictable relationship and finding areas to work together.  We’re not going to get the answer out of one meeting.  We’ll have to see what comes from that meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But let me say one other thing that I think is really important.  This meeting is not happening in a vacuum.  We’re coming off the G7.  We’re coming off a NATO summit.  We’ll be coming off of an EU summit as well.  And our leadership and our engagement is a very powerful force.  There was a major poll that was just done that found across these countries, across these democracies, 75 percent of the people on average have confidence in American leadership.  That’s up from 17 percent a year ago.  That means we’re in a much stronger position to work together with these countries militarily, diplomatically, politically, economically, including when it comes to dealing with challenges posed by Russia or China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  So the White House says that President Biden is not going to have a joint press conference with Vladimir Putin after the summit.  Is that because President Biden and Vladimir Putin are – or at least President Biden is worried that there is concern that this meeting simply will not go well? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  No, I think, Dana, the – for the President, the most effective way to be able to share with the free press what he and President Putin talked about is to do it in this way.  It’s also an opportunity, by the way, to sum up the entire week, the entire trip, the G7, the NATO summit, the EU summit.  But this is the best opportunity I have to make sure that the free press of the world gets in their questions, and the President can share what was discussed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  I’m sorry.  So are you saying that you’re not having a joint press conference because you’re worried about the Russian press being there?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  We’re – we think that having the press conference – by the way, the President, maybe even as we speak, is doing a solo press conference after the G7.  This is not exactly a rare occurrence.  But we think it’s the most effective way to be able to share with the free press what they talked about and what we’re focused on, and to make sure that you all get a chance to ask as many questions as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Before I let you go, the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan is proceeding rapidly.  There are growing calls from Congress and other forces to evacuate Afghans who helped the U.S. during this very long war.  So yes or no:  Is the administration planning an evacuation of those people?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Evacuation is the wrong word.  We’re determined to make good on our obligation to those who helped us, who put their lives on the line, put their families’ lives on the line working with our military, working with our diplomats.  And there’s a special program for so-called Special Immigrant Visas that give them a dedicated channel to apply to come to the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have put in significant resources into making sure that that program can work fast and work effectively so that we can process any requests that we get for these so-called Special Immigrant Visas.  We’ve added about 50 people here in Washington in the State Department to help do that.  We want to make sure that anyone who has helped us we are making good on our obligation to help them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken, thank you so much for joining me.  Appreciate it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks very much.  Good to be with you. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Brussels Media Hub</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Joining me now is the U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken.  Thank you so much for joining me.  Let me first ask about one of President Biden’s key goals in this summit – uniting the Western democracies around countering China’s influence, especially around the goal of building infrastructure around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the White House has not said yet that the U.S. allies are onboard for financial support, so do you have a deal on that?  Is there money behind it?  And if so, how much?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, first, Dana, just to take a step back, the President came into this meeting of the G7 determined to show that democracies can deliver, deliver for their people, deliver for people around the world.  And that’s exactly what we’ve done over the last couple of days, and I’ll come to the specific point in a second. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a commitment to a billion vaccines to put shots in arms around the world, that’s a powerful demonstration of democracies delivering; a commitment to deal with and to stop financing coal-fired plants and projects around the world, the single largest contributor to emissions and to global warming; a 15 percent minimum global corporate tax, making sure that countries around the world have a strong tax base to provide for their citizens, provide better – new markets for us as well, and avoid a race to the bottom.  And yes, this project to pool our resources, our – to invest in low and middle-income countries, to get to the private sector to do the same so that we can help them build up their infrastructure, their health care systems, education, and do it in a more positive way than China is doing it with its Belt and Road Initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So they’ve launched this project.  Our experts are going to come together over the coming months and we’ll look at the resources necessary to do that.  But individually, our countries can only do so much.  When we put all of these resources together and when we leverage the private sector, it’s a very powerful force, and we’ve got an agreement to move forward on that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QUESTION:  Let’s look ahead to President Biden’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin that’s going to be on Wednesday in Geneva.  I know the President plans to confront him on human rights, on Ukraine, on recent cyber attacks.  How do you define success out of this meeting?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Dana, this is not going to be a flip-the-light-switch moment.  What the President is going to make clear to President Putin is that we seek a more stable, predictable relationship with Russia, and if so, there are areas where our interests overlap, and we may be able to find ways to work together.  But if Russia chooses to continue reckless and aggressive actions, we will respond forcefully, as the President has already demonstrated that he would when it comes to election interference or the SolarWinds cyber attack or the attempt to murder Mr. Navalny with a chemical weapon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this is a beginning of testing the proposition, the question of whether Russia is interested in a more stable and predictable relationship and finding areas to work together.  We’re not going to get the answer out of one meeting.  We’ll have to see what comes from that meeting. </span></p>

<p>On behalf of the Government of the United States of America, I congratulate the citizens of Russia as you celebrate Russia Day.  This holiday marks the significant step Russia made on June 12, 1991, when it held its first free, open, and fair elections, and adopted the Declaration of Russian State Sovereignty.  This important document recognized the democratic aspirations and sovereignty of the peoples of Russia and guaranteed their rights and equal protections under the rule of law, and their right to life and dignity, honoring their centuries of history, culture, and traditions.</p>
<p>I take this opportunity to reaffirm the United States’ desire for constructive engagement with the government of the Russian Federation in the interest of promoting a more stable and predictable bilateral relationship.  Likewise, we remain steadfastly committed to supporting the Russian people as they continue to build on the aspirations outlined in the Declaration of Russian State Sovereignty and their desire to work together with the international community and cooperate peacefully on matters of global concern.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Child labor harms the physical and mental development of children, depriving them of their childhood, their potential, and their dignity. For their future and for the world’s future, we must do more to combat child labor and protect children from this scourge. June 12 is the World Day Against Child Labor, and 2021 is the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labor. We pledge to renew our commitment to end child labor and call upon our international partners to do the same.</p>
<p>Last year, the Convention on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor became the first convention ratified by every member of the International Labor Organization (ILO). The world agrees: Children should not be subjected to hazardous work or criminal exploitation. We have been making progress to protect children from exploitation. Since 2000, the number of children involved in child labor around the world steadily decreased. The ILO and UNICEF’s latest estimate, however, shows the first increase in child labor in two decades – the world’s progress combating child labor becoming another victim of the global pandemic. We must collectively do more.</p>
<p>The United States’ trade agreements, trade preference programs, and finance programs are conditioned on governments taking steps to enforce child labor and other labor laws. The Department of State continues to monitor and report on child labor in our annual Human Rights Report and Trafficking in Persons Report, and we contribute to the Department of Labor’s annual Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor, the most comprehensive global report on this subject. The United States is committed to continuing its fight to end these practices and protect children around the world.</p>

<p>2:00 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Good afternoon and Happy Friday, everyone. Thank you for joining today’s State Department press briefing. I have one quick announcement to make at the top and then we will resume taking your questions.</p>
<p><a id="post-251411-UNITEDNATIONS"></a> The United States congratulates Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana, and the United Arab Emirates on their election as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council for the 2022 to 2023 term.</p>
<p>We look forward to a strong and productive partnership with incoming members to address issues fundamental to the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
<p>And with that, we’ll give it a few minutes to wait for the queue.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Jennifer Hansler.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>The embassy in Kabul announced today it was suspending all visa operations as of Sunday, and I was wondering if this applies to Afghan SIV applicants, and if so, whether the State Department will take any special considerations or do anything in order to ensure that these applicants are still processed in an expedient manner. Thank you.</p>
<p><a id="post-251411-AFGHANISTAN"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thanks for your question, Jennifer. So due to COVID-19 conditions, the embassy in Kabul will, of course, temporarily be suspending visa interviews effective June 13th. And the team in Washington will actually continue processing applications at the chief-of-mission stage, but we’ll resume processing for qualified SIV applicants in Kabul, of course, as soon as it&#8217;s safe to do so. But again, just to continue to underscore, Secretary Blinken has said before, we&#8217;re withdrawing our forces from Afghanistan, but of course, we&#8217;re not withdrawing from Afghanistan. And, of course, while troops are planned to leave there in September, the United States will maintain a robust diplomatic presence throughout the U.S. embassy, and our teams in the consular section in Kabul and Washington will continue to process qualified SIV applications, of course, as expeditiously as possible.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go to Said Arikat.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Inaudible) authority to close down the Palestinian Union of Health Workers Committee office in Ramallah, and they are predicting from – it could result in some catastrophic situation, especially with the medical situation being as bad as it is in the occupied territories. And just to follow up on yesterday&#8217;s Ms. Gayle Smith presentation on the 500 million vaccines, how would you distribute these vaccines if you decide to in a place like Gaza, where you don&#8217;t have any relations, it is actually besieged by Israel and Egypt? Thank you.</p>
<p><a id="post-251411-COVIDRESPONSE"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thanks, Said. I&#8217;ll take your second question first. I won&#8217;t get into the details of the how with the distribution, but I&#8217;ll continue to underscore that U.S. has received requests for vaccines from countries all over the world. And in fact, we&#8217;re sharing 25 million vaccine doses with recipients that include Mexico, Canada, the Republic of Korea, West Bank, and Gaza. And, of course, additionally U.S. is also purchasing 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines and donating them to 92 low and lower-middle-income countries as well as economies defined by Gavi’s COVAX advanced market commitment, and to eight additional countries in the African Union.</p>
<p>To answer your first questions, we, of course, encourage all sides to refrain from steps that would exacerbate tensions.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go to Laura Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Oh, hi. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Yes, I can hear you, Laura.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay, thank you. Can you talk about some of the most important topics of the meeting between President Biden and President Erdogan on Monday? Will you – how will you address concerns over significant human rights issues in Turkey? And do you have a reaction to the Taliban rejecting Turkey’s offer to provide search security to the Kabul airport?</p>
<p><a id="post-251411-TURKEYAFGHANISTAN"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thanks, Laura. So to touch on your last part, so U.S. officials, of course, have been meeting with Turkish officials as a part of our ongoing consultations with our friends in Afghanistan on the withdraw of troops from the U.S., and coalition of troops from the Afghanistan. Of course, we’ll continue to ensure the safety and security of U.S. diplomats and personnel. But to your first question, I have nothing to read out. I won&#8217;t get ahead of the President, and would refer you to the White House for that.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go to Casey O&#8217;Neill.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Happy Friday. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Yes. Happy Friday. I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Awesome, thank you. So actually, I wanted to turn, if we could, to Myanmar. So earlier today, actually just a little while ago, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Bachelet issued a statement essentially warning of the imminent further deterioration of the situation on the ground in Myanmar. And I was just wondering if you could provide us any sense of actions that the Biden administration are taking to one, hold the junta accountable for their various human rights – numerous – excuse me – human rights violations; and two, if there’s a specific point person within the administration that’s dealing with Myanmar. Of course, we’ve seen Ambassador Feltman. He is the point person – the special envoy for the Horn. We’ve seen other special envoys. So just wondering who exactly within the administration – within the State Department is kind of the point person on this crisis. Thank you.</p>
<p><a id="post-251411-BURMA"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Well, I’ll take this – your – the second part of your question first. So we don’t have any personnel announcements to make, but what I can say at large is that we remain deeply concerned about the situation on the ground in Burma. And, of course, the military regime has shown no respect for the rule of law or the will of the people of Burma, which we are primarily concerned about. The regime’s actions, such as killing hundreds including dozens of children and unjustly detaining thousands of people, have shown little regard for justice. And again, we will continue to uplift the people of Burma, and the United States, of course, urges all countries to speak in one voice against the regime’s violence as well as the suffering of all of the people.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Simon Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hi, thanks, Jalina. I have another follow-up from Gayle Smith’s comments yesterday at the press briefing. So regarding the 500 million Pfizer vaccines that the President has pledged to – from the U.S. – Ms. Smith said that those vaccines – those doses would be bought with already appropriated funds. So that – I’m taking that to mean that that’s coming out of the 4 billion dollars that the administration had already promised to COVAX. Could you just clarify when those original – originally the President announced 2 billion and then another 2 billion that would – U.S. would give to COVAX – sort of the understanding at the time was that was cash that would go to COVAX rather than the value of donated vaccines. So is that a change – has that been kind of recategorized now as $4 billion worth of vaccines basically – or I think the estimate for the vaccine donation is 3.5 billion.</p>
<p>And secondly, related to that, Gayle Smith was talking about aiming for global coverage with these vaccine donations but also focusing on countries where there are surges and also being responsive to other countries’ request. Does that put the U.S. at odds with COVAX stated goals – stated goal of COVAX which is giving vaccines to all countries – giving all countries equal access to vaccines. It seems that you’re focus on targeting countries, with surges and also some strategic partners and neighbors, is at odds with what COVAX is trying to do. Thanks.</p>
<p><a id="post-251411-COVIDRESPONSE2"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Simon, if you’re still here on the line, I’ll briefly touch on your first one and ask you to clarify your second one. I would kind of reiterate Coordinator Smith’s comments yesterday where she didn’t go into too much detail about the numbers, but then just to kind of reiterate what we said before, I believe, when Said was on the line, is that, of course, the U.S. is purchasing the 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines and, of course, donating them to 92 low and lower-middle-income countries as it stands. But if you’re still on the line, if you could just briefly clarify your second question.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah. Yeah, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Yeah, I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so the third question was just to clarify that those – the funds to pay for those vaccines is coming out of the already pledged $4 billion to COVAX, right? And the second question is: Is there some difference in the way that the U.S. is – wants to distribute these vaccines from COVAX’s sort of stated goal of giving all countries equal access to vaccines, whereas the U.S. has sort of saying we want to target countries where there are surges and we’re responding to requests from other countries. I guess we’ve seen vaccines go to South Korea and Mexico, so it seems that there are strategic interests at play in the distribution, which – is that at odds with COVAX’s criteria for distributing vaccines?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Well, I mean what I’ll say to that is that the United States has decided in coordination with COVAX where the vaccines will go. And, of course, like – as I’ve said before too, the 92 COVAX recipients but eight additional African Union Countries. And these countries were actually defined by COVAX due to their limited resources and a limited ability to purchase those vaccines outright. And I will leave it at that, thank you.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Roman Gressier – I apologize if I’m mispronouncing your last name – El Faro.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, that’s great, thank you. Could you please confirm that the State Department has submitted formal extradition requests for three of the 14 MS-13 leaders that the Justice Department charged with terrorism offenses in January? And if you can, why those three? Will you also submit some more requests, diplomatic requests, for the remaining?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> So for the first part of your question, I’m going to have to refer you to the DOJ. For the second – your second question on diplomatic requests, we’ll actually have to take that back for you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Let’s go to Soyoung Kim.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just a question about North Korea G7 summit. I know there was no planned meetings, but will there be any pull-aside meetings between U.S., South Korea, and Japan to discuss North Korean issues during the G7 Summit?</p>
<p>And my follow-up question is I believe that President Biden will have his first in-person meeting with Russian President Putin next week in Switzerland. As Russia has a closer relationship with North Korea, do you think the two leaders will discuss cooperation for engaging with North Korea? Thank you.</p>
<p><a id="post-251411-DPRKRUSSIA"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> So to your first question, I certainly won’t get ahead of the summit. And for your second question on leaders of the DPRK and Russia, I’d have to refer you to their governments to answer that.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Yangsoon Kim.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I want to ask about the phone call between the Secretary Blinken and the Chinese Yang. And you guys said that you discussed about the Biden administration’s comprehensive North Korea review. What was the response from the China?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> If I still have you, do you mind repeating your question, please?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes. I asked about the discussion between the Blinken and the Chinese Yang that discussed about the North Korean policy review. And what was the Chinese response about the Biden administration’s North Korean policy review?</p>
<p><a id="post-251411-DPRKCHINA"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> So I would point you to our readout on Secretary Blinken’s call. We have that on our website. But just in sum, obviously, what they discussed was our comprehensive DPRK policy review which focused on the need for the United States as well as the PRC to work together for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Elizabeth Hagedorn.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you. Can you give us an update on whether the indirect talks to bring home Americans detained in Iran are still active? And then given that several G7 member countries have dual citizens held in Iran, is Tehran’s prisoner-taking and a global strategy to deter it something that Secretary Blinken is discussing with leaders at this weekend’s summit? Thanks.</p>
<p><a id="post-251411-IRAN"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> So to the first part of your question, we continue to call for the return of all U.S. citizens who are unjustly detained – of course, those who are in Iran and those who are unjustly detained in countries all over the world. And if I still have you, do you mind repeating your second question?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Sure. Is the issue of hostage-taking in Iran an issue that Secretary Blinken plans on raising with leaders of the G7?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> So I won’t get ahead of the Secretary’s meetings. And if we obviously have a readout, we will be sure to share the outcome of those meetings as well. Thanks.</p>
<p>We’ll take this last question from Kurdistan 24, Laurie Mylroie. I apologize if I said your last name wrong.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, I do. I’m sorry, I was on mute. I’m muted.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Do we still have Laurie?</p>
<p>(Interruption.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>This is Laurie Mylroie. Can you hear me now?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Yes, I can hear you, Laurie.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. My question concerns the <em>Washington Post</em> report that Russia has supplied Iran with advanced satellites that provide better surveillance capabilities. Does that change – how do you regard that and does that change your attitude towards the JCPOA negotiations?</p>
<p><a id="post-251411-RUSSIAIRAN"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Laurie, I believe she – I think if you’re still on the line it sounds like you completed your question. So what I’ll say is that we’re aware of and of course following these media reports about Russia potentially providing Iran with an advanced satellite system. Outside of that, we have nothing further to announce at this point. We don’t have any responses or any potential responses, if you will.</p>
<p>Thank you all for joining today. That concludes today’s daily press briefing.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:23 p.m.)</p>
