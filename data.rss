					<description><![CDATA[<p>Jalina Porter, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:06 p.m. EST</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Good afternoon and thank you so much for joining today’s briefing. I just have one announcement at the top, and then we will resume taking questions.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-AFGHANISTAN"></a> As a part of our continued U.S. support for the people of Afghanistan, Secretary Blinken announced today that the United States is providing more than $266 million in new humanitarian assistance, bringing the total U.S. humanitarian aid for Afghanistan to nearly $3.9 billion since 2002.</p>
<p>For many years, the United States has prioritized support for Afghan returnees, refugees, displaced persons, and other vulnerable populations. This assistance from the American people will allow our partners to provide lifesaving protection, shelter, livelihood opportunities, health care, emergency food aid, water, sanitation, and hygiene services.<a id="post-249509-_Hlk73693778"></a></p>
<p>As the United States withdraws forces from Afghanistan, we will continue to support the peaceful, stable future of – the Afghan people want and deserve, and using our full diplomatic, economic, and assistance toolkit.</p>
<p>We urge the Taliban and Afghan leaders to accelerate progress toward negotiated political settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to bring an end to more than 40 years of conflict and create the conditions that will allow refugees to return to their homes safely.</p>
<p>And we’ll start taking your questions in just one minute.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Cindy Saine.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, hello. Thank you so much. My Afghan service colleagues are asking whether this new assistance is brand new or whether it was part of the previously announced $300 million. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Cindy. This – again, to reiterate the announcement at the top, this is new funding, and this funding, to just be a little bit more specific, includes $157.5 million from USAID and also $109 million from the State Department. So that will bring our total from Fiscal Year 2020 and 2021 humanitarian assistance to more than 534 – I’m sorry, $543 million. And again, this totals $3.9 billion since 2002.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Simon Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. Thanks, Jalina. I have a question on Iran. We’re reporting that the U.S., Britain, France, and Germany are not going to seek a resolution – a Board of Governors’ resolution at the IAEA Board of Governors next week over Iran’s failure to explain uranium traces at three sites. Can you confirm that and tell us why?</p>
<p>And if the Iranians fail to explain these – the Iranians fail to explain these uranium traces, why should you trust them to adhere to the terms of a renewed JCPOA agreement, assuming you can get one? And are you going easy on them over this in hopes of securing a new deal? Thanks.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-IRAN"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Simon. So for your first question, I’m not able to comment on that from here and would have to refer you back to the IAEA. But again, as you know, these talks are ongoing, and again, we’ll continue to underscore that to enable a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA commitments, we’d like to build on the meaningful process that we’ve achieved and keep on doing that moving forward. Other than that, I don’t have anything else to announce.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Said Arikat.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Jalina, for taking my question. Very quickly, Jalina, Secretary of State Antony Blinken met today with Palestinian Americans. Can you share with us the topics he discussed with them and what kind of commitment he may have made or reiterated a U.S. commitment to help the Palestinians?</p>
<p>And second, I also wanted to ask about the ongoing sort of horrible situation in Gaza in terms of medicines, in terms of the people leaving or being allowed to leave the strip. Thank you very kindly.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-MEP"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> I think if I still have you, number one, I’ll answer your first question quickly. I can confirm the meeting, but I don’t have any other details to preview on the details of the meeting. But if I still have you, Said, can you repeat your first – your second question? Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> My second question, the situation has not – and despite there has been a ceasefire for the past, whatever, almost two weeks or close to that, two weeks, yes, in terms of patients who are in need of desperate health care and so on being allowed through the crossings into Israel, and to the West Bank, and to Egypt, and so on. So what is the administration doing in terms of either pressuring Egypt and Israel to allow the Gaza patients in and out? Thank you.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, thank you for holding. So what I would say to that is that we’re certainly not going to get ahead of the process that’s underway. And any other details we have to preview, we’ll be able to share those at a later time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Jiha Ham.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And their line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Jalina. So the U.S. is sharing 25 million vaccine doses worldwide, but the administration has no plans to share vaccines with the DPRK. I’m wondering if it is because simply there is no such request from North Korea, or it is just because there is a political decision you have made not to share the vaccines with countries like North Korea.</p>
<p>And my second question, if I may, the South Korean Government reiterated its commitment or willingness to resume its tourism project with North Korea. Could you tell us how you view on this? Is tourism between the two Koreas subject to U.S. or international sanctions? Thank you.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-DPRK"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Jiha. So to your – to answer your first question, no specific comment on any asks from the DPRK. But what I will say is that the United States and this administration has been priding itself as being a leader in vaccine diplomacy.</p>
<p>To your second question, we certainly have no comment from here on that either.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Rosiland Jordan.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And their line is open. And Rosiland Jordan, if you’re on mute &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, we can hear you now.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, sorry about that. I see that the Secretary is scheduled to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next week to testify about the proposed coming fiscal year budget. Are there particular items in the budget that the Secretary is really going to defend, especially since there is a pronounced anti-foreign aid component among congressional Republicans? And if so, how is he going to make the best case for defending that funding?</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-DEPT"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you for the question, Rosiland. So, of course, we can confirm that the Secretary will be testifying on the Hill next week, but we certainly won’t be able to get ahead of his testimony or preview anything from here today.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Hiba Nasr.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you, Jalina, for taking my question. I want to ask a question about Lebanon. The start of the trial of the Ayyash case at a special tribunal for Lebanon has been cancelled due to insufficient funding. And the tribunal itself will have to close if it is unable to solve the funding problem. Do you have any comment on that, especially that the U.S. offered $10 million for information on Ayyash?</p>
<p>And I have one more question on Iran: Do we expect anything or a significant announcement before the Iranian election?</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-IRANLEBANON"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>So to your question on Iran, we don’t have any announcements to make at this time. And to your question on Lebanon, we’re going to have to take that one back for you today.</p>
<p>Let’s go to (inaudible). My apologies if I pronounced your name incorrectly.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>You did great. Thank you so much, pronouncing (inaudible). Thank you so much for taking my call. I am just going to – regarding – I’m going to ask you regarding the current situation – as you know that Ethiopia – the Ethiopian Government just put out a statement this past weekend – I mean a week ago – for the situation that they going to have a second case for military movements or military action in Tigray. So what’s your assessment of the current situation? Are you still waiting for the Eritreans also to withdraw from Tigray region? And what’s the current situation in term of the overall on your assessment? Thank you so much.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-ETHIOPIA"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>So thank you for your question. So what I can say at a broad level is that of course the United States has concerns about the crisis in the Tigray region, of course, as well as other threats to both the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ethiopia. The people in Tigray continue to suffer human rights violations, various abuses, atrocities, and urgently need humanitarian relief that is being blocked by the Ethiopian and Eritrean militaries as well as other armed actors. And, of course, the parties – despite any significant diplomatic engagement, we call on the parties to the conflict in Tigray that have no meaningful steps or – to end the hostility, to pursue a peaceful resolution to the political crisis.</p>
<p>Let’s take our last question from Pearl Matibe.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hello, Jalina, and thank you so much for taking my question. Happy Friday. I’m wondering now that we are almost exactly 30 days or a month away from July 4th, the United States celebrates its independence. And given your foreign policy, looking at your domestic policy that determines your foreign policy, where do you think you are at now this number of days into President Biden’s administration? How can you – how are you assessing – what are the indicators that you are succeeding in this new foreign policy approach? Maybe if you can share something about that.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-DEPT2"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thank you for your question, Pearl. So as you noted, we are 30 days away from July 4th, but at the same time President Biden has also already previewed all the accomplishments that our administration has made within the first 100 days, so I would have to guide you back to his remarks that he made to the public that day and any other remarks on the administration at a wider level to the White House.</p>
<p>That concludes today’s briefing. Thank you all so much for joining, and I hope you have a great weekend ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:25 p.m.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States calls on the Nicaraguan government to immediately release opposition leader Cristiana Chamorro and her two colleagues from the recently shuttered Violeta Barrios de Chamorro Foundation for Reconciliation and Democracy.  Their detention on trumped up charges is an abuse of their rights, and it represents an assault on democratic values as well as a clear attempt to thwart free and fair elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Chamorro’s arrest comes amid unrelenting attacks on pro-democracy presidential candidates and independent media.  The Ortega regime has pledged to bar Ms. Chamorro from participating in November elections and, in May, baselessly canceled the legal status of two opposition political parties.  Rather than implement electoral reforms by the May deadline established by the Organization of American States, President Ortega instead instituted further restrictions and reduced electoral transparency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current conditions of repression and exclusion are not consistent with credible elections.  The region and the international community must stand together with the Nicaraguan people in support of their right to freely choose their government. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to the people of Afghanistan, the United States is providing more than $266 million in new humanitarian assistance, bringing total U.S. humanitarian aid for Afghanistan to nearly $3.9 billion since 2002.</p>
<p>This assistance from the American people will help our international humanitarian partners provide support to some of the estimated 18 million people in need in Afghanistan, including more than 4.8 million Afghans internally displaced.  This year alone, more than 115,000 persons have been displaced by conflict inside Afghanistan, and nearly 500,000 have returned to Afghanistan in need of assistance.  This funding will allow our partners to provide lifesaving protection, shelter, livelihoods opportunities, essential health care, emergency food aid, water, sanitation, and hygiene services to respond to the needs generated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Furthermore, this assistance helps to address protection needs for the most vulnerable Afghans.  This includes women and girls facing particular risks, including gender-based violence, as a result of the pandemic and decades of conflict.</p>
<p>We welcome the contributions of other donors toward this international response and urge others to generously support Afghanistan’s immediate humanitarian needs.  Afghanistan’s neighbors have hosted one of the largest, most-protracted refugee populations in the world.  We thank host countries for their ongoing commitment to the Afghan people and urge them to keep their borders open to Afghans seeking international protection and are working with our partners to assist host countries in their efforts.</p>
<p>For many years, the United States has prioritized support for Afghan returnees, refugees, and displaced persons.  As the United States withdraws military forces from Afghanistan, our enduring commitment is clear.  We remain engaged through our full diplomatic, economic, and assistance toolkit to support the peaceful, stable future the Afghan people want and deserve.  We urge Afghan leaders and the Taliban to accelerate progress toward a negotiated political settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to bring an end to over forty years of conflict and create the conditions that will allow refugees to return to their homes safely.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking returned on June 3 from travel to Saudi Arabia, Oman, the UAE, and Jordan.  During his trip, Special Envoy Lenderking met with senior government officials, international partners, and Yemenis to discuss the humanitarian and economic crisis in Yemen and the urgent need for a comprehensive ceasefire to bring relief to Yemenis.  The Special Envoy coordinated closely with UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths during his trip and welcomed Griffiths’ latest trip to Sana’a.  While there are numerous problematic actors inside of Yemen, the Houthis bear major responsibility for refusing to engage meaningfully on a ceasefire and to take steps to resolve a nearly seven-year conflict that has brought unimaginable suffering to the Yemeni people.  Instead, the Houthis continue a devastating offensive on Marib that is condemned by the international community and leaves the Houthis increasingly isolated.  During his meetings with Yemenis, Lenderking also discussed the need to strengthen inclusive processes that enable the country&#8217;s citizens to discuss the future of their country and amplify voices for peace.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>San Jose, Costa Rica</p>
<p>Chief of Mission Residence </p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Speaks in Spanish.)</p>
<p>(In English) So, Secretary, thank you for joining us. It’s your first visit to the region. You’ve come to Costa Rica, a very important ally. What did you hear? What are you taking? What are you taking to Vice President Harris, who will come to the region next week?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Well, first of all, it’s no accident that we’ve come to Costa Rica on this first trip to Latin America and Central America more specifically. Costa Rica’s such a strong partner for the United States when it comes to standing up for democracy, when it comes to working together on security, when it comes to leading on dealing with climate change. And coming here was an opportunity in the first instance to reinforce what is already an incredibly strong partnership.</p>
<p>But beyond that, we had a very important opportunity to meet with all of our counterparts and colleagues from across the region, from across Central America, and to talk about what I think we all hope, which is that we can build a future for people in Central America that has genuine hope and genuine opportunity. Our lives are so intertwined – the United States, the countries of Central America. We’re so interconnected that I think what I take away is we have an obligation but also an opportunity to work on these things together and offer people in all of our countries a greater sense of opportunity, a greater sense of hope. And that’s certainly what I’ll share with Vice President Harris, who’s very much looking forward to her visit in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> One of the concerns in the region, as in the rest of the world, is the pandemic, the access to vaccines. China and Russia have a big advantage on the U.S. on distributing their vaccines. Did the U.S. miss an opportunity to help these countries (inaudible) to bring down the pandemic by not distributing the vaccines before? And when will the vaccines be in the region?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Well, first, as you know, one of the first things that we did – that President Biden did upon taking office – was to re-engage with the World Health Organization, and then we very quickly made a very significant contribution to COVAX, this international facility to make sure that vaccines are accessible and are distributed on an equitable basis – $2 billion, with another 2 billion to be contributed between now and the end of next year as other countries contribute more. We’re by far the leading contributor to COVAX.</p>
<p>Having said that, President Biden also announced a few weeks ago that we will begin to make available around the world, including in this hemisphere, 80 million vaccines that we now have access to that we will, as I said, begin to make available. But here’s what’s important: We’ll distribute those vaccines working in coordination with COVAX, doing some of the work directly ourselves. We’ll do it on the basis of equity. We’ll do it on the basis of science and need. And we will do it without political strings attached, which has not been the case for some other countries that have been engaged in providing vaccines.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You met with the foreign ministers and you talked about American values – democracy, sustainability. After you met them, Government of Nicaragua started a legal process against Cristiana Chamorro, a journalist who’s considered a candidate who hadn’t announced her candidacy to the elections. This morning they raided her home; this afternoon they issued an arrest warrant against her. What is your reaction to that? You come to the region, you meet with the foreign minister, and this is how they react.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> We’ve been very disturbed by the steps that Nicaragua has taken – backward, not forward in terms of putting in place what is necessary for free and fair elections. And this is not only something that is of concern to the United States. It’s of concern to virtually every country in the region, as reflected in the work of the Organization of American States that made very clear requests of Nicaragua to put in place the processes and mechanisms necessary for free and fair elections. Nicaragua has moved in exactly the wrong direction. So this is something that we’re concerned about that all of our – virtually all of our partners in the region are.</p>
<p>And I would just say that the events also of the last 24 hours, as we see the opposition being denied the ability to compete in elections as we see the space squeezed for different voices. It is – I think the sign of a total lack of confidence because when I hear our Nicaraguan counterparts talking about all of the positive things the government has done for the people – given all of that, I would think that they would welcome the judgement of the people in free and fair elections. Apparently they don’t.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>You’re not new to the region. The region isn’t new to President Biden, but you have an issue of people going to the border.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And people even after they’re told that they’re not going to be allowed in, they say they have nothing to lose. $4 billion of investment were announced, but how are you going to do it? How are you going to convince people not to go? And how are you going to solve this issue that needs a prompt and quick solution when the problems that generate it take many years to solve?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>Well, it needs two things. You’re right. It needs a prompt and quick solution, but it also needs a long-term sustainable solution. The prompt and quick solution involves doing what we’re doing now in close partnership with Mexico but also in different ways with Guatemala, with Honduras, and El Salvador and that is, first of all, making it clear that the border is not open, that people should not come, that they’re putting their lives in tremendous jeopardy to try to make it to the border, and they will not be able to enter the United States.</p>
<p>Even as we’re doing the very important work of reforming our asylum system so that those in the future who come seeking asylum can have their cases adjudicated effectively and humanely, making sure that there are protections in place for migrants, looking to increase legal pathways to come to the United States, to work in the United States, including the increase in temporary worker visas. All of these things we’re putting in place as we are securing the border, but even if that’s a short-term response, it doesn’t answer the long-term problem. This is why I think your question is so important.</p>
<p>Here’s what we need to do, and this is what the President is focused on. We know that there are drivers to irregular migration. There are things in people’s lives that are causing them to say their only solution is to leave everything they know behind, their family, their language, their culture, their friends, their communities to make this incredibly dangerous journey and now not to be able to come into the United States. And it is a lack of effective governance. It’s the corruption that they’re dealing with in their lives. It’s profound insecurity because of violence and gangs. And maybe most fundamentally of all, it’s a lack of opportunity. It’s a lack of the ability to know that you’re going to have a job, a paycheck, the ability to put food on the table for yourself, for your family, and to build a better life.</p>
<p>So we are working in a very focused way, led by Vice President Harris on dealing with the root causes of irregular migration. We’re doing this as well in partnership with Mexico. And we know that there are answers to these problems. The Vice President, for example, recently had a call to action with our private sector to look at what it would take to make more investment in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador so that there is more opportunity. We know what needs to happen in terms of creating a better environment for investment.</p>
<p>As you mentioned, President Biden is committed to providing $4 billion over four years to work on improving the conditions. One of my colleagues last night in the meeting with SICA said that – and I thought it was very powerful – said there should be a right to remain. We have to give that meaning. We have to give meaning to the right to remain for people who – whether they’re in El Salvador or in Guatemala or Honduras or Mexico – want to make their lives and their futures at home. But the conditions make that very, very difficult. We can do something about that. It’s going to take time. It’s going to take effort. It’s going to take partnership, but we’re determined to do that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>How are you going to work with Guatemala where there is an onslaught on the independence of the judiciary by Congress – against those who fight against corruption? Honduras where the president hasn’t been accused in the U.S. but is mentioned by Department of Justice processes. His brother was convicted and sentenced for drug dealing and weapons dealing. And he, according to those documents, is part of that organization of drug dealers. And then you have El Salvador where there is also an initiative to take away independence from institutions of control. So how can you work with them if they don’t share the values that you’ve come to present?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> We will work with governments wherever we can, but we will also work with partners wherever we can. And we’ve done this before. We’ve worked directly with civil society, with NGOs, with the private sector, and all of these actors can be the effective partners that we need to actually make the assistance we’re providing meaningful, translating that into something concrete for people. And so again, for example, when it comes to building opportunity, creating investment and the jobs that flow from that, we can and we will work directly with companies. When it comes to strengthening education, we can work directly with civil society, we can work directly with communities and other individual actors.</p>
<p>So we would like to be in a position where we can work as much as possible as well directly with governments, but sometimes that’s very difficult by the choices they make. Ultimately, I believe that many leaders will come to the conclusion that what they can best offer their people is to act in a way that actually facilitates investment, partnership, engagement, and that that’s also the path to political success as well.</p>
<p>So we’re certainly going to continue to make that case. It’s something, again, that we’re also working on very closely with our partners in Mexico. We have, I think, a shared vision for building up the environment in which people really can feel secure and know that they’ll have opportunity at home. And I hope that governments in the region will do the right thing, the necessary thing in order to partner closely with us and to attract the investment that they say that they want and that they need.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> An unrelated question: Have you spoken to Foreign Minister Lavrov on this new cyber attack apparently from Russia on the meat producer that operates in the U.S., JBL, the Brazilian?</p>
<p>And does the U.S. foresee a relation with Israel without Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>Well, on the latter question, the Israelis, of course, will make their own decisions about their government as any democracy would, and we will work with any Israeli government going forward as we have in the past. President Biden has worked with every Israeli government of all parties going back to Prime Minister Golda Meir in the early 1970s. So in democracies, governments change. We’ll work with whatever government emerges, whether it’s Prime Minister Netanyahu or anyone else. So that’s (inaudible).</p>
<p>As regards Mr. Lavrov, I have not spoken to him since we saw each other a few weeks ago. Having said that, we are seeing, unfortunately, a new front in cyber threats, and that is criminal organizations using what’s called ransomware to hold hostage companies, to hold hostage critical infrastructure for financial gain. And these attacks are usually perpetrated by criminal enterprises, organizations, but they often have some physical connection, because their leaders live someplace, they’re working from someplace, and I think it’s the obligation of any country to do whatever it can to find these enterprises and to bring them to justice, including in the case of the attack on the Colonial Pipeline. The enterprise that was responsible for that attack, its leaders were in Russia, are in Russia. So I think there’s an obligation on Russia’s part to make sure that that doesn’t continue.</p>
<p>We need two things. We need to make sure that our defenses, whether it’s governments or whether it’s the private sector, are much stronger and much more effective when it comes to cyber attacks in general and so-called ransomware in particular. But we also need countries around the world to make commitments and then make good on those commitments not to harbor criminal enterprises that engage in these attacks, and on the contrary, to seek them out and to stop them and to bring them to justice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>San Jose, Costa Rica</p>
<p>Chief of Mission Residence </p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Speaks in Spanish.)</p>
<p>(In English) So, Secretary, thank you for joining us. It’s your first visit to the region. You’ve come to Costa Rica, a very important ally. What did you hear? What are you taking? What are you taking to Vice President Harris, who will come to the region next week?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Well, first of all, it’s no accident that we’ve come to Costa Rica on this first trip to Latin America and Central America more specifically. Costa Rica’s such a strong partner for the United States when it comes to standing up for democracy, when it comes to working together on security, when it comes to leading on dealing with climate change. And coming here was an opportunity in the first instance to reinforce what is already an incredibly strong partnership.</p>
<p>But beyond that, we had a very important opportunity to meet with all of our counterparts and colleagues from across the region, from across Central America, and to talk about what I think we all hope, which is that we can build a future for people in Central America that has genuine hope and genuine opportunity. Our lives are so intertwined – the United States, the countries of Central America. We’re so interconnected that I think what I take away is we have an obligation but also an opportunity to work on these things together and offer people in all of our countries a greater sense of opportunity, a greater sense of hope. And that’s certainly what I’ll share with Vice President Harris, who’s very much looking forward to her visit in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> One of the concerns in the region, as in the rest of the world, is the pandemic, the access to vaccines. China and Russia have a big advantage on the U.S. on distributing their vaccines. Did the U.S. miss an opportunity to help these countries (inaudible) to bring down the pandemic by not distributing the vaccines before? And when will the vaccines be in the region?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Well, first, as you know, one of the first things that we did – that President Biden did upon taking office – was to re-engage with the World Health Organization, and then we very quickly made a very significant contribution to COVAX, this international facility to make sure that vaccines are accessible and are distributed on an equitable basis – $2 billion, with another 2 billion to be contributed between now and the end of next year as other countries contribute more. We’re by far the leading contributor to COVAX.</p>
<p>Having said that, President Biden also announced a few weeks ago that we will begin to make available around the world, including in this hemisphere, 80 million vaccines that we now have access to that we will, as I said, begin to make available. But here’s what’s important: We’ll distribute those vaccines working in coordination with COVAX, doing some of the work directly ourselves. We’ll do it on the basis of equity. We’ll do it on the basis of science and need. And we will do it without political strings attached, which has not been the case for some other countries that have been engaged in providing vaccines.</p>

After you met them, Government of Nicaragua started a legal process against Cristiana Chamorro, a journalist who’s considered a candidate who hadn’t announced her candidacy to the elections.
