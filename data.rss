					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>We strongly condemn this week’s multiple Houthi terrorist attacks on Saudi Arabia, including today’s that struck an Aramco facility in Jeddah, which is clearly civilian infrastructure.</p>
<p>At a time when the parties should be focused on de-escalation and bringing needed life-saving relief to the Yemeni people ahead of the holy month of Ramadan, the Houthis continue their destructive behavior and reckless terrorist attacks striking civilian infrastructure.</p>
<p>We will continue to work with our Saudi partners to strengthen their defenses while also seeking to advance a durable end to the conflict, improve lives, and create the space for Yemenis to determine their own future collectively.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie D. Jenkins will lead the U.S. delegation to the first ever Review Conference of the Parties to the Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, where she will deliver the national statement.  The conference will be hosted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna from March 28 to April 1.</p>
<p>The Convention and its Amendment &#8211; known as the A/CPPNM &#8211; greatly strengthens international peace and security.  It does so by providing an international framework for the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities used for peaceful purposes. It also criminalizes the theft or sabotage of such material and facilities and enhances international cooperation and information sharing among States Parties.  Moreover, when countries implement the A/CPPNM, the nuclear security measures they put in place can enhance public confidence in the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology that are so critical to reaching sustainable development goals.</p>
<p>Today, 164 countries are party to the Convention and 129 to the Amendment, with Brazil recently becoming the 129<sup>th</sup>.  This conference will give all participating countries the opportunity to exchange information on best practices, challenges to implementation, and lessons learned, and to continue momentum toward universalization of the treaty.  Nuclear security is essential to the world’s collective security, and it is vital that all States join the United States and others from all regions of the world as parties to the A/CPPNM.  At the conference, the United States and its partners will work to gain support for a robust and regular review process of the A/CPPNM and a subsequent review conference.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The below is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>On March 24, Special Representative for the DPRK Sung Kim held separate calls with Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director General for Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau Funakoshi Takehiro and ROK Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs Noh Kyu-duk and they jointly condemned the DPRK’s March 24 ballistic missile launch, the latest in a series of increasingly escalatory launches this year.</p>
<p>Special Representative Kim and his counterparts condemned the launch as a clear violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and as presenting a serious threat to regional stability.  Special Representative Kim underscored the United States’ continued commitment to close trilateral coordination with our Japanese and ROK allies and our continued readiness to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy with the DPRK.  He reaffirmed the shared goal of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of the ROK and Japan.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The text of the following statement was released by the G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union.</p>
<p><i>Begin Text:</i></p>
<p>We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union strongly condemn the continued testing of ballistic missiles by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), including the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) launch conducted on March 24, 2022.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2022, the DPRK has conducted an unprecedented series of missile tests which build on ballistic missile tests conducted in 2021, including launches of new so-called hypersonic missiles, and has claimed a submarine-launched ballistic missile test. These tests demonstrate the DPRK’s continued efforts to expand and further develop its ballistic missile capabilities. We deeply regret that the DPRK, with the most recent launches, has also abandoned its self-declared moratorium on ICBM launches. We strongly condemn these acts which are in blatant violation of the DPRK’s obligations under numerous UN Security Council resolutions including resolution 2397 (2017). These reckless actions threaten regional and international peace and security, pose a dangerous and unpredictable risk to international civil aviation and maritime navigation in the region, and demand a united response by the international community, including by further measures to be taken by the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>We strongly urge the DPRK to fully comply with all legal obligations arising from the relevant Security Council resolutions. We call on the DPRK to accept the repeated offers of dialogue put forward by all parties concerned, including the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan. We, the G7 foreign ministers and the High Representative of the European Union, also call on the DPRK to abandon its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner.</p>
<p>We are clear that the dire humanitarian situation in the DPRK is the result of the DPRK’s diversion of the DPRK’s resources into weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs rather than into the welfare of its people.</p>
<p>We call on all States to fully and effectively implement all restrictive measures relating to the DPRK imposed by the UN Security Council and to address the risk of weapons of mass destruction proliferation from the DPRK as an urgent priority. We note with concern the report by the Panel of Experts established in pursuant to resolution 1874 (2009) that illicit ship-to-ship transfers continue to take place. We remain ready to assist in and strengthen capacities for effective sanctions implementation. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, we commend the work of the 1718 Committee, which has swiftly approved all Covid-19 related sanctions exemption requests for humanitarian assistance for the DPRK.</p>
<p>The G7 are committed to working with all relevant partners towards the goal of peace on the Korean Peninsula and to upholding the rules-based international order.</p>

		<title>United States and Allies Impose Additional Sanctions on the Burmese Military Regime</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>As we approach one year since the horrific violence perpetrated by the Burmese military on Armed Forces Day 2021, in which more than 100 people were killed, the United States is imposing sanctions on five Burmese individuals and five entities in response to the regime’s brutal crackdown against the people of Burma.  Since the February 2021 military coup, the military regime has only intensified its violent crackdown and killed more than 1,700 people, including women, children, and aid workers.  Regime security forces have detained more than 13,000 people, imprisoned former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and other former government leaders, and dispersed peaceful demonstrations with lethal force.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has designated Burmese business leaders Aung Hlaing Oo, Naing Htut Aung, and Sit Taing Aung, as well as Burmese military officials Zaw Hein and Ko Ko Oo.  OFAC has also designated the 66th Light Infantry Division, which has been tied to the “Christmas Eve massacre” in December, for its responsibility for the arbitrary detention or torture of people in Burma.  Additionally, OFAC has designated Myanmar Chemical &amp; Machinery Company Limited (MC&amp;M), International Gateways Groups of Company Limited (IGG), Htoo Group of Companies (Htoo Group), and the Asian Green Development Bank (AGDB), companies owned by Burmese business leaders.  All of these designations were made under Executive Order 14014 “Blocking Property with Respect to the Situation in Burma.”  With these designations, the United States government has sanctioned 27 entities and 70 individuals for their actions in support of the regime.</p>
<p>I recently announced the United States’ determination that members of the Burmese military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Rohingya, most of whom are Muslim.  We also recognize that for decades the Burmese military has killed, raped, and committed other atrocities against members of other ethnic and religious minority groups.  Many of these military members are in power today.  Since the coup, the military regime has shown it will target any person, regardless of ethnicity, religion, gender, or age, in order to maintain its grip on power.</p>
<p>We have taken these actions today in response to the regime’s escalating violence, to show our strong support for the people of Burma, and to promote accountability in connection with the coup and the violence perpetrated by the regime.  We will continue to impose costs on the military regime and those who support it until it ceases the violence and restores Burma’s path to democracy.</p>
<p>The United States appreciates the coordinated actions taken today by the United Kingdom and Canada under their respective sanctions programs to target Burmese actors responsible for violence and repression.</p>
<p>For more information about today’s action, see Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0679" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

<p>The United States appreciates the coordinated actions taken today by the United Kingdom and Canada under their respective sanctions programs to target Burmese actors responsible for violence and repression.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is designating six individuals for their support of the terrorist group Boko Haram.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has added Nigerian nationals Abdurrahman Ado Musa, Salihu Yusuf Adamu, Bashir Ali Yusuf, Muhammed Ibrahim Isa, Ibrahim Ali Alhassan, and Surajo Abubakar Muhammad to the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, pursuant to Executive Order 13224, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Boko Haram.</p>
<p>Today’s action follows the United Arab Emirates’ prosecutions, convictions, and designations of these individuals for supporting terrorism.  The Department of State designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization on November 14, 2013.  The Nigeria-based group is responsible for numerous attacks in the northern and northeastern regions of the country as well as in the Lake Chad Basin in Cameroon, Chad, and Niger that have killed thousands of people since 2009.</p>

		<title>Rewards for Justice – Reward Offer for Information on Russian FSB Officers Conducting Malicious Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure Between 2012-2017</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program is now offering a reward for information on Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov for their alleged involvement in computer intrusions, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and damage to the property of an energy facility offenses.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement marks the first time that RFJ has named any foreign government security personnel under its critical infrastructure reward offer.</p>
<p>RFJ, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of Akulov, Gavrilov, Tyukov, or any other person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of a foreign government, aids or abets a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which may include participation in malicious cyber activities against U.S. critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>These officers were members of an FSB component known as Center 16 and worked at a specific operational group known as Military Unit 71330, known by cybersecurity researchers as “Dragonfly,” “Energetic Bear,” and “Crouching Yeti.”</p>
<p>These FSB officers conspired to commit computer intrusions, including “supply chain attacks,” in furtherance of the Russian government’s efforts to maintain surreptitious, unauthorized, and persistent access to the computer networks of companies and other entities in the international energy sector, including oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants, and other utility and electrical grid companies.  Specifically, the conspirators targeted the software and hardware that controls equipment in power generation facilities, known as industrial control systems or supervisory control and data acquisition systems.  Access to such systems would have provided the Russian government the ability to, among other things, disrupt and damage such computer systems at a future date of its choosing..</p>
<p>In total, the defendants and the co-conspirators targeted more than 500 U.S. and foreign energy-sector companies in 135 other countries.  In just one phase of their hacking campaign, the conspirators installed malware on more than 17,000 unique devices worldwide.</p>
<p>More information about this reward offer is located on the Rewards for Justice website at <a class="external-link" href="https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/foreign-malicious-cyber-activity-against-u-s-critical-infrastructure/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/malicious_cyber_activity.html</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>. We encourage anyone with information on the malicious cyberactivity of Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov to contact Rewards for Justice via the Tor-based tips-reporting channel at: he5dybnt7sr6cm32xt77pazmtm65flqy6irivtflruqfc5ep7eiodiad.onion (Tor browser required).</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1984, the program has paid in excess of $200 million to more than 100 people across the globe who provided actionable information that helped prevent terrorism, bring terrorist leaders to justice, and resolve threats to U.S. national security. Follow us on Twitter at <a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>
