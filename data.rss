		<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New York, New York</p>
<p>United Nations Headquarters</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Good afternoon, everyone.  Very good to see you all here in New York at the United Nations, and I have to say that I’m very pleased to be here on behalf of the administration, on behalf of the United States to help kickoff a critical 30 days – the Review Conference for the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p>This has now been in force for 50 years.  It’s made a powerful difference to the world in making the world a safer place, making it less dangerous, making sure that countries with nuclear weapons, including the United States, pursue disarmament; making sure that countries that don’t have nuclear weapons do not acquire them by upholding and strengthening nonproliferation; and making sure that countries can engage in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, something that is even more vital as we deal with the challenges posed by climate change.</p>
<p>This is a critical moment for the NPT.  It’s a challenging one too because different parts of this regime are under challenge.  And of course, we see that particularly in the area of nonproliferation when we have challenges being posed by Iran, by North Korea, and now in different ways, by Russia.</p>
<p>So the next 30 days, the work that’s being done here by countries around the world to reaffirm the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to strengthen it, to strengthen each one of its pillars – disarmament, nonproliferation, peaceful use – is more vital than it’s ever been.</p>
<p>The United States will be here in force over the next month.  We have about 60 people on our team who will be here every single day working with any and every country around the world that seeks to strengthen this very, very vital regime, a treaty that has made a huge difference over the last 50 years and needs to continue to make a difference over the next 50 years.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Pam, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Thank you so much Ned and thank you &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>&#8212; Mr. Secretary.  It’s Pamala Falk from CBS News.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Yes.  Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>We heard some pretty dire forecasts this morning from the Secretary General about nuclear annihilation.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>How worried are you about Russia-occupied nuclear plants in Ukraine like Zaporizhzhia – that doesn’t have supervision – or Chernobyl?  And what is your worst fear about, say, Speaker Pelosi’s trip to China?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, first on Russia and Ukraine, step back for just one second.  Recall that when the Soviet Union dissolved, nuclear weapons were left on the territory of three new countries: Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine.  Ukraine had the confidence to give up the weapons that it inherited when the Soviet Union dissolved because of commitments that Russia made to respect and protect its sovereignty, its independence, its structural integrity.  The fact that Russia has now done exactly the opposite, that it’s attacked Ukraine unprovoked in an effort to erase that sovereignty and independence – that sends a terrible message to countries around the world that are making decisions about whether or not to pursue nuclear weapons.  So just stepping back, it’s usually important to recognize that.</p>
<p>Second, and more practically speaking in the immediate, we’re deeply concerned about the fact that Russia has taken over nuclear facilities in Ukraine, particularly in Zaporizhzhia, one of the largest nuclear facilities in Europe.  There are credible reports, including in the media today, that Russia is using this plant as the equivalent of a human shield, but a nuclear shield in the sense that it’s firing on Ukrainian from around the plant.  And of course, the Ukrainians cannot and will not fire back, lest there be a terrible accident involving a nuclear plant.  So this is the height of irresponsibility.  It’s vitally important that the IAEA get access to understand what’s happening in these facilities and to make sure that they continue to be used in ways that uphold all of the necessary commitments on safety and security at the plants.</p>
<p>With regard to Taiwan, first, the Speaker will make her own decisions about whether or not to visit Taiwan.  Congress is an independent, coequal branch of government.  The decision is entirely the Speaker’s.  What I can say is this: this is very much precedent in the sense that previous speakers visited Taiwan.  Many members of Congress go to Taiwan, including this year.  And so if the Speaker does decide to visit, and China tries to create some kind of crisis or otherwise escalate tensions, that would be entirely on Beijing.  We are looking for them, in the event she decides to visit, to act responsibly and not to engage in any escalation going forward.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  NBC.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  The Japanese &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Mr. Secretary &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  NBC, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  The Japanese &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary Blinken, on the topic of grain, we know that a ship was able &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  &#8212; to leave the port of Odesa today carrying 26,000 (inaudible) of grain across the sea.  Can you give us an update on how that’s going?  Do you expect more to get out to help the food shortage?  And also, is that a sign that tensions might be easing?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  So this is a good and important first step.  We were pleased to see that the first ship did move.  It does have 26-, 27,000 tons of grain, but keep in mind there are something like 20 million tons that are in silos and in storage in Ukraine that’s been held back by the Russian blockade of Odesa up until now, and it needs to get out.  It needs to get out to world markets, it needs to get to places where people are in desperate need of food, it needs to get out so that prices also continue to go down, not up.</p>
<p>The test will be in the days and weeks ahead.  It’s a start, it’s important.  I have to say that the leadership of Secretary-General Guterres and the United Nations has been absolutely instrumental in getting us to this day when at least we see the first ship moving.  But the test is now really in the days and weeks ahead.  More ships need to move, more grain needs to get to market.  That’s what will really make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Reuters, Michelle.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Did you talk to Prime Minister Kishida &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Reuters &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Michelle Nichols from Reuters.  You mentioned this morning that a return to the Iran nuclear deal would be the best outcome for the world.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Iranian officials have signaled a willingness to return to talks.  Is the United States ready to return to talks?  And has Speaker Pelosi told you she’s stopping in Taiwan tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Second part first.  We do not know what Speaker Pelosi intends to do, but again, that is entirely her decision, and one that we respect one way or the other.</p>
<p>Second, with regard to the JCPOA, we continue to believe, as I said this morning, that that would be the best path forward, a return to compliance on both sides to the JCPOA, to make sure that we are putting Iran’s nuclear program back in a box and averting any kind of crisis.  The EU has put forward a best proposal based on many, many months of discussions, negotiations, conversations.  It’s very consistent with something that they put forward in March that we agreed to that we would pursue in March, but we – it remains to be seen whether Iran is willing and able to move forward.</p>
<p>So we remain prepared to move forward on the basis of what’s all been agreed.  It is still unclear whether Iran is prepared to do that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  We’ll take a final question right here.  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Sir.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Did you talk to Prime Minister Kishida about Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan?  And did you share any concern about it?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  I did not speak to the Prime Minister about that.  I did have the opportunity to speak to him briefly this morning simply to say how powerful it is that he’s here on day one of the Non-Proliferation Review Conference.  It sends a very strong message around the world.  Japan’s commitment to disarmament, to nonproliferation, to the peaceful use of nuclear energy is both as a matter of history and as a matter of Japan’s leadership role in the world vitally important, and I think the Prime Minister sent a very strong message by being here today on day one of the conference.  And I just thanked him very much for doing that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Thank you everyone.</p>

		<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>More than five months into Russia’s brutal and unprovoked assault the people of Ukraine inspire the world as they defend their country and their freedom. The United States continues to stand with Allies and partners from more than 50 countries in providing vital security assistance to support Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity against Russia’s aggression.</p>
<p>Today, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the President, I am authorizing our seventeenth drawdown since August 2021 of up to $550 million in arms and equipment from U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) inventories for Ukraine’s self-defense. Today’s announcement includes more ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and 155mm artillery systems that Ukraine’s forces are using so effectively on the battlefield to defend their country. This drawdown will bring total U.S. military assistance to Ukraine to approximately $8.7 billion since the beginning of this Administration.</p>
<p>Our commitment to the people of Ukraine will not waver. We stand united with Ukraine.</p>

									<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>More than five months into Russia’s brutal and unprovoked assault the people of Ukraine inspire the world as they defend their country and their freedom. The United States continues to stand with Allies and partners from more than 50 countries in providing vital security assistance to support Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity against Russia’s aggression.</p>
<p>Today, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the President, I am authorizing our seventeenth drawdown since August 2021 of up to $550 million in arms and equipment from U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) inventories for Ukraine’s self-defense. Today’s announcement includes more ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and 155mm artillery systems that Ukraine’s forces are using so effectively on the battlefield to defend their country. This drawdown will bring total U.S. military assistance to Ukraine to approximately $8.7 billion since the beginning of this Administration.</p>
<p>Our commitment to the people of Ukraine will not waver. We stand united with Ukraine.</p>

<p align="left"><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN</b>: Well, good morning everyone. It’s so good to see colleagues around this table at what really is a critical time. We, the United States, are committed to making sure that we have a successful Review Conference for the Non-Proliferation Treaty. It could not be more timely; it could not be more important.

<p>For more than fifty years, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has been an irreplaceable and vital component of a global rules-based order.  We reaffirm the NPT as the cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation regime and as the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear technology.  We recall our enduring efforts to reduce nuclear risks in furtherance of our nuclear disarmament obligations under Article VI of the NPT.</p>
<p>As the Tenth NPT Review Conference begins, we reaffirm its continued importance, and pledge to work positively toward the full implementation of all provisions and the full realization of its purposes.  Among them is the furtherance of international peace and security, which we, as NPT nuclear-weapon states and Permanent Members of the UN Security Council, are committed to preserving and promoting.</p>
<p>The leaders of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States remain firmly committed to the objectives contained in the statement of 3 January 2022 on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races.  We recognize and act with a deep understanding that nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.  We affirm the aspiration and high stakes associated with preserving the record of non-use of nuclear weapons since 1945.  Nuclear weapons, for as long as they exist, should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression, and prevent war.  We condemn those who would use or threaten to use nuclear weapons for military coercion, intimidation, and blackmail.  Such actions are profoundly dangerous and contrary to the purposes of the NPT and the UN Charter.  Following Russia’s unprovoked and unlawful war of aggression against Ukraine, we call on Russia to cease its irresponsible and dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behaviour, to uphold its international commitments, and to recommit &#8211; in words and deeds &#8211; to the principles enshrined in the recent Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races Leaders’ statement.</p>
<p>The NPT has reduced the risk of a devastating nuclear war, and further reduction of that risk must be a priority for all NPT states parties and for this Review Conference.  We recognize that this risk is best addressed through concrete, substantive and purposeful steps and overcoming the strategic, political, and technical challenges necessary to achieve a world without nuclear weapons.  The working paper we submitted describes principles and responsibilities of responsible practices for NPT Nuclear Weapon States, and illustrates ways in which our governments will carry forward implementation of the January 3rd statement.</p>
<p>By mandating ever stronger nuclear safeguards, implemented by the International Atomic Energy Agency to verify nonproliferation undertakings, we recall that the NPT has laid the necessary basis for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and for the secure sharing of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.  The potential for further contributions in the fields of energy, agriculture, health, environment and other fields is vast.  We renew our commitment to promote and expand their contribution to sustainable development and tackling climate change around the world.</p>
<p>Previous Review Conferences, and the commitments we have made to each other, have advanced these common goals, and those commitments remain important.  Our governments have endeavored, and will continue to endeavor, to implement those commitments.  At the Tenth Review Conference, we must also continue to look forward, to identify the most pressing tasks to advance all thee pillars of the treaty: disarmament, nonproliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and technology.  Each pillar represents a shared interest of all NPT Parties, to which all can contribute.</p>
<p>We are fully aware of the difficulties we face, and of the challenges recent events have posed to all three of those pillars.  This month, our words, our actions, and the common ground we build must all reinforce the global norms that derive from this Treaty and that protect us all.  This requires that we join in rejecting irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and reckless attacks endangering nuclear reactors and associated peaceful nuclear facilities.  All NPT Parties, nuclear-weapon States or non-nuclear-weapon States, have a duty both to demonstrate and to promote responsible behavior and restraint in meeting their obligations.  We recall, in this regard, our negative and positive security assurances to NPT non-nuclear-weapon states and will honor such assurances.</p>
<p>We are committed to addressing regional proliferation crises wherever they arise.  We reiterate that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon.  We regret that, despite intense diplomatic efforts, Iran has yet to seize the opportunity to restore full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).  We urge Iran to return to full implementation of the JCPOA and UNSCR 2231 and to cooperate on an urgent basis with the IAEA in resolving questions related to possible undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran as required under its NPT-required safeguards agreement.  We further note that continued advances in the DPRK’s nuclear and missile programs pose a growing threat to our common security.  We remain committed to complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement by the DPRK of all its nuclear weapons and call on the DPRK to cease all nuclear tests and launches that use ballistic missile technology and related activities as required under multiple UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>During this Review Conference, we will examine closely and debate honestly all proposals for advancing implementation of the Treaty.  In this spirit, we pledge our best efforts to uphold international law, norms and institutions and to reach a positive, consensus outcome that will make all States and all their peoples more prosperous and more secure.</p>

<p align="left">Secretary Blinken will travel to New York for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Review Conference, where he will reaffirm the U.S. commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). He will underscore that the United States remains dedicated to preserving and strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime for future generations.  For more than 50 years, the NPT has made our world safer and more prosperous, and the treaty is never more important than in times of crisis. The United States stands ready to work with all our partners to ensure a safer world for everyone.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Non-Proliferation</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since its entry into force in 1970, the NPT has proven itself as the cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation regime and essential to international security. Articles I, II, and III of the Treaty play key roles in preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons. These include prohibiting nuclear-weapon States Parties from helping non-nuclear weapons States Parties acquire nuclear weapons (and in turn non-nuclear-weapon States Parties from receiving such assistance), establishing a link between safeguards and export controls, and by setting requirements for accepting International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards to verify that nuclear material is not diverted to nuclear weapons purposes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The United States remains dedicated to preserving and strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime for future generations. We play a leading role in ensuring the international community both responds to cases of NPT and safeguards noncompliance and provides the IAEA with the resources and political support necessary to carry out its important work. We continue to promote the combination of a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol – with a modified Small Quantities Protocol, when applicable – as the <em>de facto </em>standard for achieving NPT safeguards goals and assuring NPT obligations are met. More information on the United States’ approach to nonproliferation and the NPT can be found in this <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nonproliferation-Factsheet.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">fact sheet</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disarmament</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The NPT is the cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation regime and the basis for international cooperation to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and work toward their elimination. The United States remains committed to leading the way on arms control and addressing complex global security challenges. As President Biden said, the United States is “committed to reducing the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons” and “reinvigorating the global nuclear order to reduce the risk of use and proliferation of nuclear weapons.” Since the NPT entered into force, the United States has made significant progress towards disarmament, reducing the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, and limiting the role of nuclear weapons.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In line with its obligation under Article VI of the NPT, the United States has a long history of reducing strategic risk and enabling progress on nuclear disarmament, a history the Biden-Harris administration is deeply committed to upholding and reinvigorating. We believe multilateralism and international cooperation are essential to advancing the universal goals of the NPT and we are committed to taking practical steps together. More information on the United States’ approach to disarmament and the NPT can be found in this <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Disarmament-Factsheet.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">fact sheet</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Peaceful Uses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since the NPT came into force more than 50 years ago, cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and technology (“peaceful uses”) has grown tremendously. Increasingly, Parties to the NPT are successfully making the benefits of peaceful uses accessible to all in a safe and secure manner. Today, thanks to the confidence provided by the NPT, nuclear applications are greatly improving the lives of people all around the world and helping address some of today’s most pressing challenges, including climate change, human health, and sustainable development. The benefits are clear and all NPT Parties must work to ensure continued access to them in a safe and secure manner, and without increasing the risk of nuclear proliferation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The United States is deeply committed to advancing peaceful uses. Since 2015, the United States has provided more than $395 million to help the IAEA promote peaceful nuclear applications. In collaboration with the United Kingdom and with support from other NPT States Parties, the United States has also launched a new effort to expand access to the benefits of peaceful uses cooperation. Working with the IAEA, the Sustained Dialogue will promote greater access, understanding, and acceptance of peaceful nuclear technologies, elaborate on how peaceful uses can help meet UN Sustainable Development Goals, and drive new areas of international cooperation in advancing peaceful uses consistent with our NPT obligations. For more information on the United States’ approach to peaceful uses and the NPT see this <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Peaceful-Uses-Factsheet.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">fact sheet</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a>.</li>

Increasingly, Parties to the NPT are successfully making the benefits of peaceful uses accessible to all in a safe and secure manner. Today, thanks to the confidence provided by the NPT, nuclear applications are greatly improving the lives of people all around the world and helping address some of today’s most pressing challenges, including climate change, human health, and sustainable development. The benefits are clear and all NPT Parties must work to ensure continued access to them in a safe and secure manner, and without increasing the risk of nuclear proliferation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The United States is deeply committed to advancing peaceful uses. Since 2015, the United States has provided more than $395 million to help the IAEA promote peaceful nuclear applications. In collaboration with the United Kingdom and with support from other NPT States Parties, the United States has also launched a new effort to expand access to the benefits of peaceful uses cooperation. Working with the IAEA, the Sustained Dialogue will promote greater access, understanding, and acceptance of peaceful nuclear technologies, elaborate on how peaceful uses can help meet UN Sustainable Development Goals, and drive new areas of international cooperation in advancing peaceful uses consistent with our NPT obligations. For more information on the United States’ approach to peaceful uses and the NPT see this <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Peaceful-Uses-Factsheet.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">fact sheet</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a>.</li>

		<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I congratulate the people of Switzerland as you celebrate your National Day and honor the founding of your confederation.</p>
<p>The United States deeply values our partnership with Switzerland and our shared commitment to advancing peace and prosperity around the world. We have been called “sister republics” because we share a mutual respect for democratic principles and the promotion of human rights, which are strengthened by the innumerable economic and cultural ties that bind us. We appreciate Switzerland’s leadership in international diplomacy, especially your support for the people of Ukraine as they respond to Russia’s brutal war. We also appreciate Switzerland’s role as our Protecting Power in Iran and your contributions to global peace and security.</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing to strengthen our cooperation and collaboration in the year ahead and beyond. Happy National Day!</p>
