					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland and an interagency delegation, including representatives from the National Security Council, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Southern Command, visited Paraguay, Panama, and El Salvador from June 27-30.  The delegation met with Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Euclides Acevedo, and other cabinet members; with Panamanian President Laurentino Cortizo Cohen and Acting Foreign Minister Dayra Carrizo, as well as the Panama Canal Administrator Ricaurte Vásquez; and with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill Tinoco, and other Salvadoran leaders.  They also met with successful young innovators, entrepreneurs, and other civil society leaders in the three countries to discuss their visions for the future.</p>
<p>During her trip, Under Secretary of State Nuland:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relaunched the U.S.-Paraguay Strategic Partnership Dialogue, which last met in 2016, to expand bilateral coordination on issues of mutual interest, including democracy and security, trade and investment, development and good governance, and cooperation with likeminded partners like Taiwan.</li>
<li>Announced the U.S. donation of one million Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to Paraguay, with additional vaccine donations to Panama and El Salvador in the coming weeks. This is in addition to $2 billion in funding and additional vaccine donations to Gavi, which supported procurement and delivery of vaccines through COVAX the COVID-19 vaccine-sharing facility, for worldwide distribution.</li>
<li>Announced an agreement between Banco Sudameris and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), and a parallel agreement with Citibank, for $125 million of financing for Paraguayan Small and Medium Enterprises to focus on enabling women-owned and led businesses as well as those that benefit women, with 30 percent of DFC loan proceeds going to this purpose.</li>
<li>Announced the start of talks to establish a network of Small Business Development Centers in Paraguay to provide counseling and services to help small businesses grow and create jobs.</li>
<li>In a meeting with President Laurentino Cortizo, advanced our partnership with Panama to manage the ongoing challenges of irregular migration and forced displacement in and through the region.</li>
<li>Emphasized the importance of data privacy and customer trust in maintaining regional technological infrastructure integrity with Panamanian telecommunications sector leaders, recognizing Panama’s development toward serving as a digital hub for the region.</li>
<li>Reaffirmed the close relationship between the United States and Panama on key issues of climate change, and environmental preservation. Panama remains a leader in the region for championing the environment, and their aggressive climate goals make them the ideal hosts for the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA) Ministerial in 2022 and the Our Ocean Conference in 2023.</li>
<li>Underscored U.S. support for Panama’s efforts to combat illicit finance, particularly through the joint Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Corruption Task Force,</li>
<li>In El Salvador, reinforced U.S. support for strong democratic institutions, transparency, and rule of law in meetings with Salvadoran President Bukele Foreign Minister Hill, and in roundtables with civil society and with young Salvadoran political leaders.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Ben Franklin Room</p>
<p><b>MS JOHNSTONE: </b>Good afternoon, and welcome. My name is Kari Johnstone. I am the acting director of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.</p>
<p>Thank you all for joining us virtually to mark the release of the 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report, or the TIP Report. I am grateful to be here with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>
<p>A quick word about our program today: First, Secretary Blinken will offer remarks on this year’s report. We will then honor this year’s eight wonderful TIP Report Heroes, who have dedicated their lives to combat human trafficking, and we will hear briefly from each of them in a pre-recorded video. I will offer brief closing remarks and then we hope you will click over to <a href="http://state.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://state.gov&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1625257487712000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG6ZnQYIEQEeJPXejoWNj6RAHS1eA">state.gov</a> to access the report online.</p>
<p>I would like to start by thanking our colleagues across the State Department, including our overseas embassies, for the strong collaboration and time spent to produce an accurate and comprehensive report. And I want to give a second thank you – a special thank you and kudos to the staff of the Trafficking in Persons Office for your dedication and commitment. Your long hours and hard work producing this report make a difference. And finally, thank you to our colleagues across the U.S. Government as well as our vital partners in NGOs and international organizations, those with lived experience of human trafficking, and other experts who contributed to the TIP Report and work to facilitate progress in addressing human trafficking year-round.</p>
<p>And it is now such an honor to join Secretary Blinken here today. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for elevating the issue of human trafficking and for hosting today’s event. Under your leadership, we look forward to advancing our efforts to combat human trafficking.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>
<p>(Applause.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>Thank you, Kari. Thank you very much for that introduction, but especially thank you for the terrific work leading the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons here at State. You and your team – and I know some of the team members are here with us today – did exceptional work producing this year’s report under the difficult circumstances of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone else who&#8217;s here for joining us for what is a very important occasion. And a special thank you to the Heroes that we&#8217;re celebrating today, women and men around the world who have dedicated their careers to stopping human trafficking. They’re advocates, public servants, leaders of NGOs, and they help stop trafficking in all kinds of ways by supporting victims, helping to bring traffickers to justice, creating national action plans, addressing the root causes of trafficking.</p>
<p>In many ways, the fight against trafficking is fought on the local level, one community at a time. And we celebrate the brave people leading the fight, often at great risk to themselves. Trafficking in persons is an appalling crime. It&#8217;s a global crisis; it&#8217;s an enormous source of human suffering. By its nature, it&#8217;s often hidden from view. Exact figures are sometimes hard to determine. The estimate we often cite is that nearly 25 million people worldwide are victims of human trafficking. Many are compelled into commercial sex work. Many are forced to work in factories or fields, or to join armed groups. Millions of trafficking victims are children.</p>
<p>This crime is an affront to human rights; it&#8217;s an affront to human dignity. We fight it, you fight it, because it&#8217;s the right thing to do. It&#8217;s also in our interest to stop trafficking. We know it&#8217;s destabilizing to societies and to economies. So we must do everything we can as a country, but also as a global community, to stop trafficking wherever it occurs.</p>
<p>The State Department&#8217;s Trafficking in Persons Report is indeed the world&#8217;s most comprehensive resource of the anti-trafficking efforts being undertaken by governments around the globe. It reflects the United States longstanding commitment and bipartisan commitment to this issue. We see it from administration to administration, we see it in Congress, and it&#8217;s something that we should take pride in. It’s the product of a great deal of work by our team here in Washington, our embassies around the world, and by NGOs, by journalists, academics, and survivors who help us to identify and document trends in human trafficking so that governments worldwide can more effectively combat it.</p>
<p>Part of this report is our country data. This year, we assessed 188 countries, including the United States. Some made encouraging progress; some slid backward. It&#8217;s important to remember that progress against trafficking is rarely linear. Traffickers are constantly adapting their methods, and every country, including the United States, must keep adapting our own strategies to stay ahead of them. We&#8217;ve got to identify and acknowledge our own shortcomings and be willing to course correct when needed. The TIP Report can help us do that by laying out the significant steps the United States and other countries must take to fight this crime and protect victims.</p>
<p>In addition to the country data, this year’s report explores a few topics in depth. The first is the impact of COVID-19. In many places, as governments diverted resources to try to control the pandemic and address its secondary impacts, human traffickers seized the opportunity to grow their operations. People who were pushed into dire economic circumstances by the pandemic became more vulnerable to exploitation. And as more people spent hours online for school and work, traffickers used the internet to groom and recruit potential victims.</p>
<p>So the pandemic has had a real impact on this fight. It’s another reason why it’s so important to stop the pandemic as quickly as we can and help communities around the world. The longer it takes, the more people will become vulnerable to trafficking.</p>
<p>We applaud those governments that found ways to step up their work against trafficking even during COVID. For example, in Paraguay, as thousands of citizens abroad sought to return home, the government established temporary quarantine facilities at the border. They asked everyone screening questions, and through those questions they were able to identify nearly 300 victims of human trafficking. That’s nearly four times the average number of victims they had identified in previous years. Then the Paraguayan Government moved those victims to their own dedicated facilities, where they began receiving critical health and social support services right away. It was a brilliant strategy for moving fast to help victims of trafficking when the opportunity presented itself.</p>
<p>Second, this year’s report focuses on state-sponsored human trafficking. We documented 11 countries where the government itself is the trafficker – for example, through forced labor on public work projects or in sectors of the economy that the government feels are particularly important.</p>
<p>For the 10th year in a row, the report documents how the Cuban Government has profited from exploitative overseas medical missions. They send doctors and other medical personnel abroad, fail to inform them of the terms of their contracts, confiscate their documents and salaries, threaten them and their family members when they try to leave.</p>
<p>We also report on what’s happening in Xinjiang, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. The Chinese Government has detained more than 1 million people in as many as 1,200 state-run internment camps throughout Xinjiang. Many detainees are subjected to physical violence, sexual abuse, and torture to induce them to work producing apparel, electronics, solar equipment, agricultural products.</p>
<p>And while the practices are the most egregious in Xinjiang, this year’s report notes that China has subjected its citizens to coercive labor practices in other parts of the country as well. The United States has taken measures to stop Chinese goods made with forced labor from making their way into our country. For example, last year, the Departments of State, Commerce, Treasury, and Homeland Security issued a Xinjiang supply chain business advisory to alert U.S. companies of the economic, legal, and reputational exposure to or in connection with operations, supply chains, or laborers from Xinjiang.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to call on our partners around the world to join us in condemning China’s genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and in taking steps to prevent goods made with forced labor from entering our supply chains. Governments should protect and serve their citizens, not terrorize and subjugate them for profit.</p>
<p>And third, the report explicitly acknowledges the connection between systemic inequality and human trafficking. This is something many countries need to grapple with, including the United States. Part of doing right by our people means taking a hard look at the ways that our history and our policies have created the conditions for crimes like human trafficking, because traffickers prey on those who are vulnerable – those who are less likely to have access to good jobs or educational opportunities, who are less likely to be treated as equal by police or the justice system, and who are less likely to be believed when they report that they’re being targeted or abused.</p>
<p>If we’re serious about ending trafficking in persons, we must also work to root out systemic racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination, and to build a more equitable society in every dimension. These goals go hand in hand. So let’s keep that in mind as we work to build back better from the devastation of the pandemic.</p>
<p>I often talked about how the most urgent challenges facing our world cannot be solved by any one country acting alone. That’s true for stopping COVID, it’s true for dealing with the climate crisis, it’s true for the fight against human trafficking. We need to work together, share information, hold each other accountable. That’s how we’ll create a world where no one is exploited by trafficking and everyone is able to live in safety and in dignity.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS JOHNSTONE:</b> Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your strong message and those encouraging words. You have long been a champion for anchoring U.S. foreign policy on ensuring human dignity and expanding opportunities for all.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to now turn to celebrating the 2021 TIP Report Heroes. Traditionally we have honored these Heroes in-person at this event. While we wish we could be together, due to COVID-19 precautions, our Heroes are joining us virtually again this year.</p>
<p>To get to know each of our honorees better, we asked this year’s Heroes to prepare short videos answering: “What do you hope to achieve through your anti-trafficking work?” In the following video, you will hear their responses. I am certain you will understand why we are honoring each of them today.</p>
<p>Please join me as we recognize and honor this year’s eight TIP Report Heroes.</p>
<p>(Video is played.)</p>
<p><b>MS JOHNSTONE:</b> Imelda Poole, in recognition of her exceptional activism in combating human trafficking in Albania and across Europe that has achieved systemic change through grassroots action, employing big picture solutions to address the root causes of vulnerability to the crime, and empowering those with lived experience through her organization’s principles of freedom, justice, truth, and joy.</p>
<p><b>MS POOLE:</b> Hello. My name is Imelda Poole. Working with Mary Ward Loreto in Albania and RENATE across Europe, my dream for the future is a social economy with a change in law and its implementation which will adopt a trauma-informed, victim-centered, and human rights approach to the law, both in its practice and in terms of real life. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS JOHNSTONE:</b> Josiane Lina Bemaka-Soui, in recognition of her herculean efforts in creating and driving the Central African Republic’s anti-trafficking response by operationalizing the country’s interagency committee, leading the development of the government’s first national action plan to combat human trafficking, and catalyzing action even in difficult conditions at often great personal sacrifice.</p>
<p><b>MS BEMAKA-SOUI:</b> (Via translation) I am Josiane Lina Bemaka-Soui, Advisor to the President on the Protection of Children and Child Soldiers. With this award, my goal will be to completely eradicate human trafficking in the Central African Republic and establish a new legal code on protection of victims of human trafficking in my country.</p>
<p><b>MS JOHNSTONE:</b> Chantal Sagbo Sasse, in recognition of her unwavering and heartfelt commitment to the protection and care of child trafficking victims, her creativity and persistence in raising awareness among community members and government officials about human trafficking, and her invaluable anti-trafficking contributions and expertise shared with the Government of Gabon.</p>
<p><b>MS SAGBO:</b> (Via translation) Hello, everyone. I am Chantal Sagbo, president and founder of the NGO Sifos.

Thank you very much.</p>
<p>(Applause.)</p>
<p><b>MS JOHNSTONE:</b> What an inspiring group of leaders. It is such an honor to celebrate your important work.</p>
<p>The TIP Report represents a key tool to effect positive change and encourage governments to increase and improve their anti-trafficking efforts. This includes the United States.</p>
<p>As we evaluated the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on anti-trafficking efforts around the world for this year’s report, it was impossible to ignore the pandemic’s devastating effects. In the chaos and hardship of the last year, we have also seen excellent examples of leadership, resilience, adaptability across the anti-trafficking community – from international organizations to local NGOs, governments, and survivor leaders.</p>
<p>Mexico secured its first trafficking in persons conviction from a virtual court session in June 2020, just weeks after resuming legal proceedings following a two-month shutdown.</p>
<p>In Albania, Senegal, and Jordan, COVID-19 mitigation measures were combined with strategic outreach to populations vulnerable to trafficking.</p>
<p>In addition to these great adaptations, I want to highlight another excellent resource that the department will release in the coming weeks – a guidance document on COVID-19 considerations for anti-trafficking efforts – developed by our Human Trafficking Expert Consultant Network, which comprises individuals with lived experience of human trafficking and other subject matter experts. This guide will include promising practices and helpful standard operating procedures to continue anti-trafficking efforts during a crisis – like this pandemic – while still integrating a trauma-informed approach. Considerable work remains to address the challenges we still face related to the pandemic, but we hope this guidance will advance the integration of a trauma-informed approach into any new crisis-related adaptations.</p>
<p>For the last few years, we have sought to increasingly highlight through our report the importance of governments engaging with survivors and implementing trauma-informed approaches when doing so. We have done so, and our report is all the stronger for it. For the second year, Network experts developed the “Topics of Special Interest” for this year’s report – one about the unique complexities in familial trafficking and another about unifying trauma-informed practices and survivor leadership.</p>
<p>The Network also helped us evaluate and improve the process we use to select photos for the TIP Report. We did this in response to recommendations made in previous years by experts with lived experience of human trafficking. You will notice as you flip through the introduction that there are more photos that include the input of those survivors being photographed. I know we still have a long way to go to truly realize a trauma-informed approach across our anti-trafficking efforts, but I am thankful for the Network experts who helped us to make concrete improvements this year. We will continue to raise the importance of survivor engagement in building a truly effective, comprehensive anti-trafficking response – not just on paper through the TIP Report – but in our year-round engagement with governments around the world.</p>
<p>We know that we can do even better, and we will seek to hold ourselves and – accountable and be transparent in our efforts. I am encouraged by the innovative adaptations of governments, NGOs, and survivor leaders to ensure that our anti-trafficking response is comprehensive and addresses issues as they arise. I look forward to working with all of you to continue the fight against human trafficking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Ben Franklin Room</p>
<p><b>MS JOHNSTONE: </b>Good afternoon, and welcome. My name is Kari Johnstone. I am the acting director of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.</p>
<p>Thank you all for joining us virtually to mark the release of the 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report, or the TIP Report. I am grateful to be here with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>
<p>A quick word about our program today: First, Secretary Blinken will offer remarks on this year’s report. We will then honor this year’s eight wonderful TIP Report Heroes, who have dedicated their lives to combat human trafficking, and we will hear briefly from each of them in a pre-recorded video. I will offer brief closing remarks and then we hope you will click over to <a href="http://state.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://state.gov&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1625257487712000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG6ZnQYIEQEeJPXejoWNj6RAHS1eA">state.gov</a> to access the report online.</p>
<p>I would like to start by thanking our colleagues across the State Department, including our overseas embassies, for the strong collaboration and time spent to produce an accurate and comprehensive report. And I want to give a second thank you – a special thank you and kudos to the staff of the Trafficking in Persons Office for your dedication and commitment. Your long hours and hard work producing this report make a difference. And finally, thank you to our colleagues across the U.S. Government as well as our vital partners in NGOs and international organizations, those with lived experience of human trafficking, and other experts who contributed to the TIP Report and work to facilitate progress in addressing human trafficking year-round.</p>
<p>And it is now such an honor to join Secretary Blinken here today. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for elevating the issue of human trafficking and for hosting today’s event. Under your leadership, we look forward to advancing our efforts to combat human trafficking.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>
<p>(Applause.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b>Thank you, Kari. Thank you very much for that introduction, but especially thank you for the terrific work leading the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons here at State. You and your team – and I know some of the team members are here with us today – did exceptional work producing this year’s report under the difficult circumstances of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone else who&#8217;s here for joining us for what is a very important occasion. And a special thank you to the Heroes that we&#8217;re celebrating today, women and men around the world who have dedicated their careers to stopping human trafficking. They’re advocates, public servants, leaders of NGOs, and they help stop trafficking in all kinds of ways by supporting victims, helping to bring traffickers to justice, creating national action plans, addressing the root causes of trafficking.</p>
<p>In many ways, the fight against trafficking is fought on the local level, one community at a time. And we celebrate the brave people leading the fight, often at great risk to themselves. Trafficking in persons is an appalling crime. It&#8217;s a global crisis; it&#8217;s an enormous source of human suffering. By its nature, it&#8217;s often hidden from view. Exact figures are sometimes hard to determine. The estimate we often cite is that nearly 25 million people worldwide are victims of human trafficking. Many are compelled into commercial sex work. Many are forced to work in factories or fields, or to join armed groups. Millions of trafficking victims are children.</p>
<p>This crime is an affront to human rights; it&#8217;s an affront to human dignity. We fight it, you fight it, because it&#8217;s the right thing to do. It&#8217;s also in our interest to stop trafficking. We know it&#8217;s destabilizing to societies and to economies. So we must do everything we can as a country, but also as a global community, to stop trafficking wherever it occurs.</p>
<p>The State Department&#8217;s Trafficking in Persons Report is indeed the world&#8217;s most comprehensive resource of the anti-trafficking efforts being undertaken by governments around the globe. It reflects the United States longstanding commitment and bipartisan commitment to this issue. We see it from administration to administration, we see it in Congress, and it&#8217;s something that we should take pride in. It’s the product of a great deal of work by our team here in Washington, our embassies around the world, and by NGOs, by journalists, academics, and survivors who help us to identify and document trends in human trafficking so that governments worldwide can more effectively combat it.</p>
<p>Part of this report is our country data. This year, we assessed 188 countries, including the United States. Some made encouraging progress; some slid backward. It&#8217;s important to remember that progress against trafficking is rarely linear. Traffickers are constantly adapting their methods, and every country, including the United States, must keep adapting our own strategies to stay ahead of them. We&#8217;ve got to identify and acknowledge our own shortcomings and be willing to course correct when needed. The TIP Report can help us do that by laying out the significant steps the United States and other countries must take to fight this crime and protect victims.</p>
<p>In addition to the country data, this year’s report explores a few topics in depth. The first is the impact of COVID-19. In many places, as governments diverted resources to try to control the pandemic and address its secondary impacts, human traffickers seized the opportunity to grow their operations. People who were pushed into dire economic circumstances by the pandemic became more vulnerable to exploitation. And as more people spent hours online for school and work, traffickers used the internet to groom and recruit potential victims.</p>
<p>So the pandemic has had a real impact on this fight. It’s another reason why it’s so important to stop the pandemic as quickly as we can and help communities around the world. The longer it takes, the more people will become vulnerable to trafficking.</p>
<p>We applaud those governments that found ways to step up their work against trafficking even during COVID. For example, in Paraguay, as thousands of citizens abroad sought to return home, the government established temporary quarantine facilities at the border. They asked everyone screening questions, and through those questions they were able to identify nearly 300 victims of human trafficking. That’s nearly four times the average number of victims they had identified in previous years. Then the Paraguayan Government moved those victims to their own dedicated facilities, where they began receiving critical health and social support services right away. It was a brilliant strategy for moving fast to help victims of trafficking when the opportunity presented itself.</p>
<p>Second, this year’s report focuses on state-sponsored human trafficking. We documented 11 countries where the government itself is the trafficker – for example, through forced labor on public work projects or in sectors of the economy that the government feels are particularly important.</p>
<p>For the 10th year in a row, the report documents how the Cuban Government has profited from exploitative overseas medical missions. They send doctors and other medical personnel abroad, fail to inform them of the terms of their contracts, confiscate their documents and salaries, threaten them and their family members when they try to leave.</p>
<p>We also report on what’s happening in Xinjiang, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. The Chinese Government has detained more than 1 million people in as many as 1,200 state-run internment camps throughout Xinjiang. Many detainees are subjected to physical violence, sexual abuse, and torture to induce them to work producing apparel, electronics, solar equipment, agricultural products.</p>
<p>And while the practices are the most egregious in Xinjiang, this year’s report notes that China has subjected its citizens to coercive labor practices in other parts of the country as well. The United States has taken measures to stop Chinese goods made with forced labor from making their way into our country. For example, last year, the Departments of State, Commerce, Treasury, and Homeland Security issued a Xinjiang supply chain business advisory to alert U.S. companies of the economic, legal, and reputational exposure to or in connection with operations, supply chains, or laborers from Xinjiang.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to call on our partners around the world to join us in condemning China’s genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and in taking steps to prevent goods made with forced labor from entering our supply chains. Governments should protect and serve their citizens, not terrorize and subjugate them for profit.</p>
<p>And third, the report explicitly acknowledges the connection between systemic inequality and human trafficking. This is something many countries need to grapple with, including the United States. Part of doing right by our people means taking a hard look at the ways that our history and our policies have created the conditions for crimes like human trafficking, because traffickers prey on those who are vulnerable – those who are less likely to have access to good jobs or educational opportunities, who are less likely to be treated as equal by police or the justice system, and who are less likely to be believed when they report that they’re being targeted or abused.</p>
<p>If we’re serious about ending trafficking in persons, we must also work to root out systemic racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination, and to build a more equitable society in every dimension. These goals go hand in hand. So let’s keep that in mind as we work to build back better from the devastation of the pandemic.</p>
<p>I often talked about how the most urgent challenges facing our world cannot be solved by any one country acting alone. That’s true for stopping COVID, it’s true for dealing with the climate crisis, it’s true for the fight against human trafficking. We need to work together, share information, hold each other accountable. That’s how we’ll create a world where no one is exploited by trafficking and everyone is able to live in safety and in dignity.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MS JOHNSTONE:</b> Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your strong message and those encouraging words. You have long been a champion for anchoring U.S. foreign policy on ensuring human dignity and expanding opportunities for all.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to now turn to celebrating the 2021 TIP Report Heroes. Traditionally we have honored these Heroes in-person at this event. While we wish we could be together, due to COVID-19 precautions, our Heroes are joining us virtually again this year.</p>
<p>To get to know each of our honorees better, we asked this year’s Heroes to prepare short videos answering: “What do you hope to achieve through your anti-trafficking work?” In the following video, you will hear their responses. I am certain you will understand why we are honoring each of them today.</p>
<p>Please join me as we recognize and honor this year’s eight TIP Report Heroes.</p>

<p><b>MS JOHNSTONE:</b> What an inspiring group of leaders. It is such an honor to celebrate your important work.</p>
<p>The TIP Report represents a key tool to effect positive change and encourage governments to increase and improve their anti-trafficking efforts. This includes the United States.</p>
<p>As we evaluated the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on anti-trafficking efforts around the world for this year’s report, it was impossible to ignore the pandemic’s devastating effects. In the chaos and hardship of the last year, we have also seen excellent examples of leadership, resilience, adaptability across the anti-trafficking community – from international organizations to local NGOs, governments, and survivor leaders.</p>
<p>Mexico secured its first trafficking in persons conviction from a virtual court session in June 2020, just weeks after resuming legal proceedings following a two-month shutdown.</p>
<p>In Albania, Senegal, and Jordan, COVID-19 mitigation measures were combined with strategic outreach to populations vulnerable to trafficking.</p>
<p>In addition to these great adaptations, I want to highlight another excellent resource that the department will release in the coming weeks – a guidance document on COVID-19 considerations for anti-trafficking efforts – developed by our Human Trafficking Expert Consultant Network, which comprises individuals with lived experience of human trafficking and other subject matter experts. This guide will include promising practices and helpful standard operating procedures to continue anti-trafficking efforts during a crisis – like this pandemic – while still integrating a trauma-informed approach. Considerable work remains to address the challenges we still face related to the pandemic, but we hope this guidance will advance the integration of a trauma-informed approach into any new crisis-related adaptations.</p>
<p>For the last few years, we have sought to increasingly highlight through our report the importance of governments engaging with survivors and implementing trauma-informed approaches when doing so. We have done so, and our report is all the stronger for it. For the second year, Network experts developed the “Topics of Special Interest” for this year’s report – one about the unique complexities in familial trafficking and another about unifying trauma-informed practices and survivor leadership.</p>
<p>The Network also helped us evaluate and improve the process we use to select photos for the TIP Report. We did this in response to recommendations made in previous years by experts with lived experience of human trafficking. You will notice as you flip through the introduction that there are more photos that include the input of those survivors being photographed. I know we still have a long way to go to truly realize a trauma-informed approach across our anti-trafficking efforts, but I am thankful for the Network experts who helped us to make concrete improvements this year. We will continue to raise the importance of survivor engagement in building a truly effective, comprehensive anti-trafficking response – not just on paper through the TIP Report – but in our year-round engagement with governments around the world.</p>
<p>We know that we can do even better, and we will seek to hold ourselves and – accountable and be transparent in our efforts. I am encouraged by the innovative adaptations of governments, NGOs, and survivor leaders to ensure that our anti-trafficking response is comprehensive and addresses issues as they arise. I look forward to working with all of you to continue the fight against human trafficking.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Good morning, everyone, and thanks very much for joining us today as we are previewing the forthcoming release of the State Department 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report.  Just as a reminder, this call is on background.  You can attribute what you hear to a senior State Department official.  It’s also embargoed.  The embargo will be lifted upon the start of the formal event we are convening later today with Secretary Blinken.  We expect that event will start around 1 p.m. and the embargo will lift as soon as that event starts.</p>
<p>So just for the purposes of your background information, today’s speaker will be .  But again, she should be referred to as a senior State Department official for the purposes of your reporting.  And again, this call is embargoed until around 1 p.m. when we expect Secretary Blinken will start the formal event.</p>
<p>So with that, I will turn it over to our senior State Department official, and we’ll take your questions from there.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thank you, , and good morning.  Thank you all for joining this briefing and for your interest in the Trafficking in Persons Report.  I’ll begin just by sharing a little background information and some context on the report itself.</p>
<p>So the Trafficking in Persons Report, also known as the TIP Report, is the U.S. Government’s principal diplomatic and diagnostic tool to guide relations with foreign governments on human trafficking.  It is also the world’s most comprehensive resource on governmental anti-trafficking efforts, and it reflects the U.S. Government’s commitment to global leadership on this key human rights, law enforcement, and national security issue.</p>
<p>This year’s report, which is the 21st installment, includes narratives for 188 countries and territories, including the United States.</p>
<p>A country’s tier ranking reflects the State Department’s assessment of that government’s efforts during the reporting period to meet the Trafficking Victim Protection Act minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons.  The department strives to make the report as accurate and objective as possible, documenting the successes and shortcomings of government anti-trafficking efforts, and it does not make assessments based on political considerations.</p>
<p>The TIP Report assesses a country’s efforts against those TVPA minimum standards and against its own efforts during the previous reporting period; it does not compare countries.  It also takes into account a country’s resources and capacity when weighing factors.</p>
<p>And just to clarify, the reporting period is from April 1, 2020 through March 31st of 2021 for this year’s report.</p>
<p>All governments should strive to continually improve their efforts across what are referred to as the 3Ps of the anti-trafficking framework – of prosecution, protection, and prevention.  In fact, the TVPA requires governments to demonstrate continual progress, especially to retain rankings on Tier 1 or Tier 2.</p>
<p>Tier 2 Watch List rankings are time-limited by U.S. law, as governments can only retain this ranking for a maximum of three consecutive years; thus, here too ongoing efforts to improve are critical.  For Tier 3 governments – those that are assessed as failing to make significant efforts to meet the minimum standards and do not, in fact, meet the minimum standards – also Tier 3 countries include countries whose governments have a policy or pattern of trafficking.  For those countries on Tier 3, restrictions on assistance may apply.</p>
<p>The TIP Report introduction focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trafficking trends and anti-trafficking efforts around the world.  It outlines how the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated trafficking situations and significantly increased the number of people worldwide at risk to exploitation, as well as how traffickers adapted their methods to take advantage of these circumstances.</p>
<p>The introduction also illustrates the innovative ways that many have adapted their anti-trafficking efforts.  It emphasizes lessons learned from practitioners, offers ways to rebuild strong anti-trafficking strategies, and focuses on ways governments can prevent the compounding effects of crises on trafficking victims and vulnerable individuals.</p>
<p>We saw, for example, that the governments of countries such as Paraguay identified significantly more trafficking victims through routine screening at pandemic quarantine facilities, or in Turkey, where the government trained shelter staff on pandemic mitigation efforts and provided COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment to victims staying at those shelters.  Mexico secured its first trafficking in persons conviction from a virtual court session in June 2020, just weeks after resuming legal proceedings following a two-month shutdown related to the pandemic.  Lebanon and the Czech Republic extended the ability of migrants to stay in those countries for their safety related to the pandemic and also adjusted the limits of their respective visa regimes – all to help ensure the victims were protected during the pandemic.  These are just a few of many examples that the report outlines.</p>
<p>The introduction to this year’s report also seeks to elevate other important themes, such as the struggle to realize racial equity, the importance of survivor leadership, the harmful effects of conspiracy theories related to trafficking, and the reality of familial trafficking.</p>
<p>We also included a box in the introduction this year on state-sponsored trafficking in persons and, due to the scale of the problem, one specifically on forced labor in China’s Xinjiang region and beyond.</p>
<p>I would also like to share some noteworthy results and tier movement within this year’s report.  Overall, there are approximately the same number of downgrades and upgrades as in prior years.</p>
<p>On a positive note, there were several upgrades due to tangible progress that governments made to combat trafficking around the world despite the pandemic.  We saw progress even in countries where the trafficking challenges have been intractable over many years.</p>
<p>Several governments received upgrades to Tier 2 for increasing efforts to address trafficking, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Dominican Republic, Jordan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Not all countries made such progress.  Six countries received downgrades from Tier 1 to Tier 2 as the department assessed that the governments of the Republic of Cyprus, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, and Switzerland did not meet all four of the minimum standards and were therefore not making “appreciable progress” compared to the previous year and no longer met the minimum standards to stay on Tier 1.</p>
<p>Twelve countries were also downgraded from Tier 2 to Tier 2 Watchlist.  I won’t list the full number, but I’ll note a couple that may attract your attention include South Africa and Thailand.</p>
<p>There were also two countries that were downgraded this year from the Watch List to Tier 3.  Those two countries are Guinea-Bissau and Malaysia.</p>
<p>There is also an important provision in the TVPA, the Trafficking Victim Protection Act, that requires the department to make a determination whether countries have a policy or pattern of the government engaged in trafficking.</p>
<p>This year, the department made that determination that 11 countries continued to have a government policy or pattern of trafficking and inadequate enforcement mechanisms; some government officials in these countries were themselves part of the problem, directly compelling citizens or foreign nationals into sex trafficking, forced labor, or use as child soldiers.</p>
<p>We found that officials used their power to exploit their citizens or foreign nationals ranging from forced labor in local or national public works projects, military operations, economically important sectors, or as part of government-funded projects or missions abroad, to sexual slavery on government compounds.</p>
<p>I’m happy to share the list of 11 countries, but in the interest of time I’ll probably not read the full list now.  But I will note a couple of particular interest.  China remained on Tier 3 and is again noted for having a government policy of forced labor, particularly in Xinjiang detention in camps that is intended to erase ethnic and religious identities under the pretext of “vocational training,” and forced labor is a central tactic used for this repression.</p>
<p>Also, the Cuban Government increased the number and size of overseas medical missions.  Dozens of country reports include information regarding the program’s lack of transparency, unaddressed labor violations, and forced labor.</p>
<p>Finally, just two more points I wanted to raise at the beginning.</p>
<p>This year, 15 countries are included on the 2021 Child Soldier Prevention Act List for having governmental armed groups or supporting nongovernmental armed groups that recruit or use children in armed conflict.</p>
<p>And finally, the department is recognizing eight TIP Report heroes who have devoted their lives to the fight against human trafficking.</p>
<p>The 2021 heroes come from Albania, the Central African Republic, Gabon, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Qatar, and Spain.  These individuals inspire each of us to do more to advance the global fight against human trafficking and protect the victims and survivors of this crime.  The ceremony today that Secretary Blinken will host will highlight and celebrate the accomplishments of these extraordinary individuals.</p>
<p>And with that, thank you very much.  I’ll be happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Great, thank you very much.  Operator, if you want to repeat the instructions for asking questions.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your telephone keypad.  Please ensure your line is open before starting your question.  Once again, please press 1 then 0 on your telephone keypad.  One moment, please.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Okay, let’s start with the line of Missy Ryan, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks.  And thanks very much for this briefing.  I just had a question about Afghanistan, and I see that – so if I understood correctly, it’s on Tier 3 for the – is it – am I correct to say second year?  And so I’m wondering what the impact, if any, is on American assistance to Afghanistan currently or in the future, and what the situation is around that.  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yes, thank you so much for that question.  Afghanistan did again demonstrate a government policy or pattern of human trafficking and will therefore again appear on Tier 3.  As you noted, Tier 3 countries may carry restrictions for non-humanitarian and non-trade-related assistance.  The president may waive those restrictions, as he did for Afghanistan when it was placed on Tier 3 in the 2020 TIP Report.  Those restrictions go into effect for the next fiscal year, so he waived the restrictions for this fiscal year that went into – that began in October.  This summer, there will be a process of preparing recommendations to inform the President’s decisions for the countries that appear on Tier 3 in the 2021 TIP Report, and we expect that the President will make those decisions before the beginning of the next fiscal year in October.</p>
<p>And you are right, this is the second year that Afghanistan is on Tier 3 for a government policy or pattern of human trafficking.  Specifically, the report notes in the area of the use and recruitment of child soldiers as well as a widespread practice of bacha bazi, which is essentially sexual slavery on government compounds.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  We’ll go to the line of Matt Lee.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Matt, I think – yeah, I think your line’s open.  Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah.  All right.  I assume you can hear me, so I’m just going to go ahead and do it.  I’m sorry, these are kind of logistical questions.  Could you just repeat the list of six countries downgraded from Tier 1 to Tier 2?  And also, were there any countries that moved from Tier 3 up?  And then the last one is:  For Guinea-Bissau and Malaysia, are those – those were demoted because of the statutory time that they could be exempted or put into the Watch List, or was there demonstrable regression in their approach?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yeah, thank you for all those questions.  I hope I got them all.  If I missed any, feel – please feel free to repeat them.</p>
<p>The six countries that were downgraded from Tier 1 to Tier 2 include Cyprus, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, and Switzerland.  There were four countries upgraded from Tier 3 this year.  They include Belarus, Burundi, Lesotho, and Papua New Guinea.  And the two countries that were downgraded to Tier 3, Guinea-Bissau and Malaysia, were in fact both out of time on the Watch List.  They had exceeded their time.  They had been on the Watch List for three years, and therefore were no longer able legally to stay on the Watch List and did not make enough progress to support an upgrade to Tier 2, and therefore were automatically downgraded to Tier 3.</p>
<p>Did I get all your questions?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Sounded like you did.  Let’s go on to the line of Lara Jakes, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, good morning.  Is my line open?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Great, thanks.  In terms of the pandemic’s impact on human trafficking, can you give us a little more sense of what kind of trends you saw that were more prevalent or more alarming than in years past that were directly caused by the pandemic?  I was looking in the – kind of the executive summary.  I see that there was a trend of the – perhaps the pandemic had spurred more migration and made people more vulnerable to trafficking.  I also saw a large section on stay-at-home sex trafficking victims.</p>
<p>And I’m just wondering, which – not that this is a zero-sum game, but which one of these trends seemed to grow at a more alarming rate directly caused by the pandemic?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thank you for those important questions.  We have spent a lot of time this year gathering information and carefully analyzing the effects of the pandemic on trafficking trends, on trafficking victims and survivors, as well as government and service providers’ response to trafficking.</p>
<p>Overall, the concurrence of the increased number of individuals at risk due to the pandemic, traffickers’ ability to capitalize on competing crises, and the diversion of resources to pandemic response efforts has resulted, in many ways, in an ideal environment for human trafficking to flourish and evolve.</p>
<p>Despite these added challenges and risks that the pandemic presented, we have also witnessed the adaptability among those continuing to fight human trafficking and their dedication to ensuring the continuation of anti-trafficking efforts and minimize the effects of the pandemic on victims and the broader anti-trafficking community.</p>
<p>To your question about some of the specific effects, we did see that during the pandemic, anti-trafficking stakeholders experienced a number of conditions that made work to combat trafficking in persons exceptionally difficult.  Governments faced reduced capacities as priorities shifted to focus on growing health and economic concerns.  Victims and survivors faced heightened risk of re-victimization and obstacles accessing assistance and support as lockdowns, social distancing protocols, and a lack of resources caused survivor service providers to close shelters and reduce services.</p>
<p>Technology, as you noted, was widely utilized both to safely continue to combat trafficking such as to – you noted the negatives.  I’ll note the positives first and then the negatives.  Technology was also used to resume prosecution efforts and investigation efforts and to prevent further court backlogs through virtual investigative and court proceedings.</p>
<p>We did, unfortunately, also see that the increased use of technology created more vulnerability that traffickers unfortunately also exploited, as you noted, through online sex trafficking.  Also traffickers used the internet and other remote connectivity options to recruit trafficking victims, often with fraudulent job offers, so we did see, unfortunately, that that was a trend.  Thankfully, we saw the governments, service providers, NGOs, and many survivors themselves were resilient and adapted to the evolving situation as well.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Go the line of Humeyra Pamuk.  Humeyra Pamuk.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I’m assuming everyone can hear me, so I’ll just go ahead.  I just want to ask – I see that Turkey has moved to the list of countries who are implicated in the use of child soldiers.  I just want to confirm if this is the first time a NATO member is on this list, and I just want to also ask a little bit about methodology.  There have been reports that the – some of the Syrian factions that Turkey has supported have been involved in various human rights abuses, use of child soldiers.  The fact that the country made it to this list this year, does that mean the United States has now independently verified these reports?</p>
<p>And my final question is:  How does this impact any military cooperation with Turkey?  I’m well aware that there is a specific distinction in attribution to the armed groups that it supports and not the country’s armed forces, but still, U.S. is in the middle of negotiating a really important deal for Turkey to run the Kabul airport, and I’m looking at the report and it says – it talks about a number of restrictions on security assistance and a few other things, and Turkey is seeking financial and various military support to run the Kabul airport from United States.  Would that have any impact on it if that’s the case?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yeah, thank you very much for that important question.  The United States places considerable attention on the issue of the unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers.  The United States condemns the practice of unlawfully recruiting or using child soldiers and work to end this practice, which is considered a form of human trafficking in certain circumstances, and we work to do so wherever it occurs.  Through this abhorrent practice, governments and government-supported armed groups rob innocent children of their childhoods and may cause them to commit terrible violence, in some cases against their own loved ones.</p>
<p>Across the globe, wherever we see this occurring, we raise this issue through both military and civilian channels, and we work with concerned citizens, the United Nations, and nongovernmental organizations.  Our aim is to monitor, report on, and prevent the unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers, as well as to protect, assist, and rehabilitate these children, including by working with civil society and governments of countries where governments or government-supported armed groups unlawfully recruit or use child soldiers.</p>
<p>And I want to pause on that last sentence just to note that that is the legal standard, that the Child Soldier Prevention Act requires the State Department to list countries on this list where either governments or government-supported armed groups are unlawfully recruiting or using child soldiers.  And through this list, the United States puts on notice those countries where we do have credible information of the recruitment or use of child soldiers.  We take these allegations very seriously.  We conduct in-depth research on all relevant information and engage directly with governments year-round regarding these concerns.</p>
<p>With respect to Turkey in particular, you are correct that this is the first time a NATO member has been listed on the Child Soldier Prevention Act list.  As a respected regional leader and member of NATO, Turkey has the opportunity to address this issue, the recruitment and use of child soldiers in Syria and Libya.  We did determine and document in this report that the Government of Turkey provided support to the Sultan Murad Division, a non-state armed group that recruited and used child soldiers.  This division is a Syrian armed opposition group that operates under the umbrella of the Turkish-supported Syrian National Army.  The Government of Turkey provided tangible support to the Sultan Murad Division which included transit through Turkish territory during the reporting period of – as I said before, that reporting period is April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021.  The United States hopes to work with Turkey to encourage all groups involved in the Syrian and Libyan conflicts not to use child soldiers, and we hope to work with Turkey to address this issue in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Michel Ghandour.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes.  What does the Tier 3 list include other than China, Cuba, and Afghanistan?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  There – it’s a fairly long list.  There are 15 countries, I think, on the list.  I’m happy to read you the list of countries that are on Tier 3 in alphabetical order.  They include Afghanistan, as we already discussed; Algeria, Burma, China, Comoros, Cuba, Eritrea, Guinea Bissau, Iran, North Korea, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Russia, South Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.  Sorry, it’s 17; I counted wrong.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We&#8217;ll take a couple final questions.  Let’s go to Jiha Ham, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, I hope you can hear me.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We can.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you for doing this.  Thank you for taking my question.  I have a question on North Korea.  So the report on North Korea, it says the Chinese Government often sends North Korea defectors back to North Korea forcibly.  But according to the report, because of the COVID, North Korean authorities in 2020 refused to accept more than 200 defectors.  I&#8217;m sure they are still in China, because the border is still closed between the two countries.  So my question is:  Were there any efforts that the U.S. Government tried to intervene the situation or directly at China not to send these defectors back to North Korea?  If not, what will be your message to China?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yeah, thank you for that question.  We have long noted concerns in the TIP Report in both the China and the North Korea narrative for many years, our concerns about defectors or other North Korean nationals being returned to North Korea and the risk that they face to forced labor, other forms of trafficking, and other human rights abuses, if they are returned.  We have included a recommendation in the China narrative for many years and have raised this issue with the Chinese Government.  We encourage them not to return people back to North Korea, particularly without screening for human trafficking, since we know this is a population that’s particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.  Obviously, we have much broader human rights concerns in North Korea, and this is one of many issues that we raise with the Chinese Government.  And we publicly note our concerns about North Korea.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We’ll go to the line of Mouhamed Elahmed.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, .  Thank you for doing this.  I have couple of questions, please.  I was skimming over the report, and it seems that the Syrian refugees, especially women and children, have been trafficked, used, and exploited in so many countries in the Middle East, like Egypt for example.  So how does this represent the challenge to the U.S. efforts to address this issue in the Middle East?  Are there any programs that the USAID, for example, is planning to provide to help those victims to rehabilitate?</p>
<p>And finally, do you think that by solving the refugee crisis in Syria or even in Yemen, would that help in reduce or eliminate the trafficking persons in the Middle East that has been increased in the recent years?  Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yeah, thank you for that question.  You are right that – to point out that Syrian refugees are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking and all kinds of other hostilities throughout the region.  We have long documented those concerns and trafficking abuses that occur, that traffickers target Syrian refugees, as they do many other refugees and migrants, both in the Middle East region and more broadly in the world.  They comprise a group of people that traffickers recognize often do not have a safety net around them. They may not have family relatives; they may not have a lot of other options to seek help and support.  And therefore, traffickers often prey and target specifically refugees and migrants.  And sadly, that is very true for Syrian refugees and migrants in the region as well.</p>
<p>We have included recommendations for many years for countries in the region, both the Middle East and I would also say European countries that have also hosted or through which Syrian migrants and refugees have traveled, and urge those governments to screen for trafficking indicators and identify proactively trafficking victims among this group so that they can get them the care that they need, that is tailored for trafficking victims to prevent their future exploitation and potential re-trafficking as well.  We’ve also used some of our foreign assistance funds specifically to raise awareness and build governments’ capacity in the region to identify and provide care for those trafficking victims among this group.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Well, we will leave it there.  I want to thank our speaker.  Again, this call was on background.  You can refer to our speaker as a senior State Department official, and the call is embargoed until approximately one o&#8217;clock today, when the event with Secretary Blinken begins.  We will have additional opportunities for you to hear from the Secretary and from senior State Department officials today, including at the press briefing on the rollout of the 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report.  Thanks, everyone, for joining, and we’ll talk to you later today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Good morning, everyone, and thanks very much for joining us today as we are previewing the forthcoming release of the State Department 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report.  Just as a reminder, this call is on background.  You can attribute what you hear to a senior State Department official.  It’s also embargoed.  The embargo will be lifted upon the start of the formal event we are convening later today with Secretary Blinken.  We expect that event will start around 1 p.m. and the embargo will lift as soon as that event starts.</p>
<p>So just for the purposes of your background information, today’s speaker will be .  But again, she should be referred to as a senior State Department official for the purposes of your reporting.  And again, this call is embargoed until around 1 p.m. when we expect Secretary Blinken will start the formal event.</p>
<p>So with that, I will turn it over to our senior State Department official, and we’ll take your questions from there.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thank you, , and good morning.  Thank you all for joining this briefing and for your interest in the Trafficking in Persons Report.  I’ll begin just by sharing a little background information and some context on the report itself.</p>
<p>So the Trafficking in Persons Report, also known as the TIP Report, is the U.S. Government’s principal diplomatic and diagnostic tool to guide relations with foreign governments on human trafficking.  It is also the world’s most comprehensive resource on governmental anti-trafficking efforts, and it reflects the U.S. Government’s commitment to global leadership on this key human rights, law enforcement, and national security issue.</p>
<p>This year’s report, which is the 21st installment, includes narratives for 188 countries and territories, including the United States.</p>
<p>A country’s tier ranking reflects the State Department’s assessment of that government’s efforts during the reporting period to meet the Trafficking Victim Protection Act minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons.  The department strives to make the report as accurate and objective as possible, documenting the successes and shortcomings of government anti-trafficking efforts, and it does not make assessments based on political considerations.</p>
<p>The TIP Report assesses a country’s efforts against those TVPA minimum standards and against its own efforts during the previous reporting period; it does not compare countries.  It also takes into account a country’s resources and capacity when weighing factors.</p>
<p>And just to clarify, the reporting period is from April 1, 2020 through March 31st of 2021 for this year’s report.</p>
<p>All governments should strive to continually improve their efforts across what are referred to as the 3Ps of the anti-trafficking framework – of prosecution, protection, and prevention.  In fact, the TVPA requires governments to demonstrate continual progress, especially to retain rankings on Tier 1 or Tier 2.</p>
<p>Tier 2 Watch List rankings are time-limited by U.S. law, as governments can only retain this ranking for a maximum of three consecutive years; thus, here too ongoing efforts to improve are critical.  For Tier 3 governments – those that are assessed as failing to make significant efforts to meet the minimum standards and do not, in fact, meet the minimum standards – also Tier 3 countries include countries whose governments have a policy or pattern of trafficking.  For those countries on Tier 3, restrictions on assistance may apply.</p>
<p>The TIP Report introduction focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trafficking trends and anti-trafficking efforts around the world.  It outlines how the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated trafficking situations and significantly increased the number of people worldwide at risk to exploitation, as well as how traffickers adapted their methods to take advantage of these circumstances.</p>
<p>The introduction also illustrates the innovative ways that many have adapted their anti-trafficking efforts.  It emphasizes lessons learned from practitioners, offers ways to rebuild strong anti-trafficking strategies, and focuses on ways governments can prevent the compounding effects of crises on trafficking victims and vulnerable individuals.</p>
<p>We saw, for example, that the governments of countries such as Paraguay identified significantly more trafficking victims through routine screening at pandemic quarantine facilities, or in Turkey, where the government trained shelter staff on pandemic mitigation efforts and provided COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment to victims staying at those shelters.  Mexico secured its first trafficking in persons conviction from a virtual court session in June 2020, just weeks after resuming legal proceedings following a two-month shutdown related to the pandemic.  Lebanon and the Czech Republic extended the ability of migrants to stay in those countries for their safety related to the pandemic and also adjusted the limits of their respective visa regimes – all to help ensure the victims were protected during the pandemic.  These are just a few of many examples that the report outlines.</p>
<p>The introduction to this year’s report also seeks to elevate other important themes, such as the struggle to realize racial equity, the importance of survivor leadership, the harmful effects of conspiracy theories related to trafficking, and the reality of familial trafficking.</p>
<p>We also included a box in the introduction this year on state-sponsored trafficking in persons and, due to the scale of the problem, one specifically on forced labor in China’s Xinjiang region and beyond.</p>
<p>I would also like to share some noteworthy results and tier movement within this year’s report.  Overall, there are approximately the same number of downgrades and upgrades as in prior years.</p>
<p>On a positive note, there were several upgrades due to tangible progress that governments made to combat trafficking around the world despite the pandemic.  We saw progress even in countries where the trafficking challenges have been intractable over many years.</p>

<p>We found that officials used their power to exploit their citizens or foreign nationals ranging from forced labor in local or national public works projects, military operations, economically important sectors, or as part of government-funded projects or missions abroad, to sexual slavery on government compounds.</p>
<p>I’m happy to share the list of 11 countries, but in the interest of time I’ll probably not read the full list now.  But I will note a couple of particular interest.  China remained on Tier 3 and is again noted for having a government policy of forced labor, particularly in Xinjiang detention in camps that is intended to erase ethnic and religious identities under the pretext of “vocational training,” and forced labor is a central tactic used for this repression.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Great, thanks.  In terms of the pandemic’s impact on human trafficking, can you give us a little more sense of what kind of trends you saw that were more prevalent or more alarming than in years past that were directly caused by the pandemic?  I was looking in the – kind of the executive summary.  I see that there was a trend of the – perhaps the pandemic had spurred more migration and made people more vulnerable to trafficking.  I also saw a large section on stay-at-home sex trafficking victims.</p>
<p>And I’m just wondering, which – not that this is a zero-sum game, but which one of these trends seemed to grow at a more alarming rate directly caused by the pandemic?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thank you for those important questions.  We have spent a lot of time this year gathering information and carefully analyzing the effects of the pandemic on trafficking trends, on trafficking victims and survivors, as well as government and service providers’ response to trafficking.</p>
<p>Overall, the concurrence of the increased number of individuals at risk due to the pandemic, traffickers’ ability to capitalize on competing crises, and the diversion of resources to pandemic response efforts has resulted, in many ways, in an ideal environment for human trafficking to flourish and evolve.</p>
<p>Despite these added challenges and risks that the pandemic presented, we have also witnessed the adaptability among those continuing to fight human trafficking and their dedication to ensuring the continuation of anti-trafficking efforts and minimize the effects of the pandemic on victims and the broader anti-trafficking community.</p>
<p>To your question about some of the specific effects, we did see that during the pandemic, anti-trafficking stakeholders experienced a number of conditions that made work to combat trafficking in persons exceptionally difficult.  Governments faced reduced capacities as priorities shifted to focus on growing health and economic concerns.  Victims and survivors faced heightened risk of re-victimization and obstacles accessing assistance and support as lockdowns, social distancing protocols, and a lack of resources caused survivor service providers to close shelters and reduce services.</p>
<p>Technology, as you noted, was widely utilized both to safely continue to combat trafficking such as to – you noted the negatives.  I’ll note the positives first and then the negatives.  Technology was also used to resume prosecution efforts and investigation efforts and to prevent further court backlogs through virtual investigative and court proceedings.</p>
<p>We did, unfortunately, also see that the increased use of technology created more vulnerability that traffickers unfortunately also exploited, as you noted, through online sex trafficking.  Also traffickers used the internet and other remote connectivity options to recruit trafficking victims, often with fraudulent job offers, so we did see, unfortunately, that that was a trend.  Thankfully, we saw the governments, service providers, NGOs, and many survivors themselves were resilient and adapted to the evolving situation as well.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Go the line of Humeyra Pamuk.  Humeyra Pamuk.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I’m assuming everyone can hear me, so I’ll just go ahead.  I just want to ask – I see that Turkey has moved to the list of countries who are implicated in the use of child soldiers.  I just want to confirm if this is the first time a NATO member is on this list, and I just want to also ask a little bit about methodology.  There have been reports that the – some of the Syrian factions that Turkey has supported have been involved in various human rights abuses, use of child soldiers.  The fact that the country made it to this list this year, does that mean the United States has now independently verified these reports?</p>
<p>And my final question is:  How does this impact any military cooperation with Turkey?  I’m well aware that there is a specific distinction in attribution to the armed groups that it supports and not the country’s armed forces, but still, U.S. is in the middle of negotiating a really important deal for Turkey to run the Kabul airport, and I’m looking at the report and it says – it talks about a number of restrictions on security assistance and a few other things, and Turkey is seeking financial and various military support to run the Kabul airport from United States.  Would that have any impact on it if that’s the case?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yeah, thank you very much for that important question.  The United States places considerable attention on the issue of the unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers.  The United States condemns the practice of unlawfully recruiting or using child soldiers and work to end this practice, which is considered a form of human trafficking in certain circumstances, and we work to do so wherever it occurs.  Through this abhorrent practice, governments and government-supported armed groups rob innocent children of their childhoods and may cause them to commit terrible violence, in some cases against their own loved ones.</p>
<p>Across the globe, wherever we see this occurring, we raise this issue through both military and civilian channels, and we work with concerned citizens, the United Nations, and nongovernmental organizations.  Our aim is to monitor, report on, and prevent the unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers, as well as to protect, assist, and rehabilitate these children, including by working with civil society and governments of countries where governments or government-supported armed groups unlawfully recruit or use child soldiers.</p>
<p>And I want to pause on that last sentence just to note that that is the legal standard, that the Child Soldier Prevention Act requires the State Department to list countries on this list where either governments or government-supported armed groups are unlawfully recruiting or using child soldiers.  And through this list, the United States puts on notice those countries where we do have credible information of the recruitment or use of child soldiers.  We take these allegations very seriously.  We conduct in-depth research on all relevant information and engage directly with governments year-round regarding these concerns.</p>
<p>With respect to Turkey in particular, you are correct that this is the first time a NATO member has been listed on the Child Soldier Prevention Act list.  As a respected regional leader and member of NATO, Turkey has the opportunity to address this issue, the recruitment and use of child soldiers in Syria and Libya.  We did determine and document in this report that the Government of Turkey provided support to the Sultan Murad Division, a non-state armed group that recruited and used child soldiers.  This division is a Syrian armed opposition group that operates under the umbrella of the Turkish-supported Syrian National Army.  The Government of Turkey provided tangible support to the Sultan Murad Division which included transit through Turkish territory during the reporting period of – as I said before, that reporting period is April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021.  The United States hopes to work with Turkey to encourage all groups involved in the Syrian and Libyan conflicts not to use child soldiers, and we hope to work with Turkey to address this issue in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Michel Ghandour.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes.  What does the Tier 3 list include other than China, Cuba, and Afghanistan?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  There – it’s a fairly long list.  There are 15 countries, I think, on the list.  I’m happy to read you the list of countries that are on Tier 3 in alphabetical order.  They include Afghanistan, as we already discussed; Algeria, Burma, China, Comoros, Cuba, Eritrea, Guinea Bissau, Iran, North Korea, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Russia, South Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.  Sorry, it’s 17; I counted wrong.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We&#8217;ll take a couple final questions.  Let’s go to Jiha Ham, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, I hope you can hear me.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We can.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you for doing this.  Thank you for taking my question.  I have a question on North Korea.  So the report on North Korea, it says the Chinese Government often sends North Korea defectors back to North Korea forcibly.  But according to the report, because of the COVID, North Korean authorities in 2020 refused to accept more than 200 defectors.  I&#8217;m sure they are still in China, because the border is still closed between the two countries.  So my question is:  Were there any efforts that the U.S. Government tried to intervene the situation or directly at China not to send these defectors back to North Korea?  If not, what will be your message to China?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yeah, thank you for that question.  We have long noted concerns in the TIP Report in both the China and the North Korea narrative for many years, our concerns about defectors or other North Korean nationals being returned to North Korea and the risk that they face to forced labor, other forms of trafficking, and other human rights abuses, if they are returned.  We have included a recommendation in the China narrative for many years and have raised this issue with the Chinese Government.  We encourage them not to return people back to North Korea, particularly without screening for human trafficking, since we know this is a population that’s particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.  Obviously, we have much broader human rights concerns in North Korea, and this is one of many issues that we raise with the Chinese Government.  And we publicly note our concerns about North Korea.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We’ll go to the line of Mouhamed Elahmed.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, .  Thank you for doing this.  I have couple of questions, please.  I was skimming over the report, and it seems that the Syrian refugees, especially women and children, have been trafficked, used, and exploited in so many countries in the Middle East, like Egypt for example.  So how does this represent the challenge to the U.S. efforts to address this issue in the Middle East?  Are there any programs that the USAID, for example, is planning to provide to help those victims to rehabilitate?</p>
<p>And finally, do you think that by solving the refugee crisis in Syria or even in Yemen, would that help in reduce or eliminate the trafficking persons in the Middle East that has been increased in the recent years?  Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yeah, thank you for that question.  You are right that – to point out that Syrian refugees are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking and all kinds of other hostilities throughout the region.  We have long documented those concerns and trafficking abuses that occur, that traffickers target Syrian refugees, as they do many other refugees and migrants, both in the Middle East region and more broadly in the world.  They comprise a group of people that traffickers recognize often do not have a safety net around them. They may not have family relatives; they may not have a lot of other options to seek help and support.  And therefore, traffickers often prey and target specifically refugees and migrants.  And sadly, that is very true for Syrian refugees and migrants in the region as well.</p>
<p>We have included recommendations for many years for countries in the region, both the Middle East and I would also say European countries that have also hosted or through which Syrian migrants and refugees have traveled, and urge those governments to screen for trafficking indicators and identify proactively trafficking victims among this group so that they can get them the care that they need, that is tailored for trafficking victims to prevent their future exploitation and potential re-trafficking as well.  We’ve also used some of our foreign assistance funds specifically to raise awareness and build governments’ capacity in the region to identify and provide care for those trafficking victims among this group.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Well, we will leave it there.  I want to thank our speaker.  Again, this call was on background.  You can refer to our speaker as a senior State Department official, and the call is embargoed until approximately one o&#8217;clock today, when the event with Secretary Blinken begins.  We will have additional opportunities for you to hear from the Secretary and from senior State Department officials today, including at the press briefing on the rollout of the 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report.  Thanks, everyone, for joining, and we’ll talk to you later today.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States is committed to improving social, economic, and political conditions in Central America because U.S. security and prosperity is tied to the success of our regional partners. Actions that undermine the rule of law and democracy in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, and their repercussions on the lives of people in these countries, contribute to irregular migration and destabilize entire societies.  As stated in the recent U.S. Presidential Decree Establishing the Fight Against Corruption as a Core U.S. National Security Interest: “<em>Corruption corrodes public trust; hobbles effective governance; distorts markets and equitable access to services; undercuts development efforts; contributes to national fragility, extremism, and migration; and provides authoritarian leaders a means to undermine democracies worldwide.  When leaders steal from their nations’ citizens or oligarchs flout the rule of law, economic growth slows, inequality widens, and trust in government plummets.”</em></p>
<p>The citizens of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador have consistently repudiated corruption, demanded accountability on the part of their governments and private actors in their countries, and acted in defense of democratic institutions. The United States stands with those citizens, organizations, and public servants who are committed to promoting the public good and generating hope and opportunity for the people of the region, even in the face of setbacks to the rule of law and efforts to combat impunity.</p>
<p>In the context of this support, the U.S. Government is issuing a public list, consistent with section 353 of the United States–Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act, of individuals who have knowingly engaged in acts that undermine democratic processes or institutions, engaged in significant corruption, or obstructed investigations into such acts of corruption in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.  Section 353 generally requires that individuals listed in this report are ineligible for visas and admission to the United States.</p>
<p>We will continue partnering with government officials who show a dedication to combating corruption and strengthening democratic governance, including as part of an overall policy of addressing the root causes of irregular migration.  Our objective with these designations is to support the people of  Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in their efforts to form a democratic, prosperous, and safe region where people can contribute to and benefit from the democratic process, have confidence in public institutions, reduce inequality, and enjoy opportunities to create the futures they desire for themselves and their families.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Women are a powerful force for peace and essential partners in advancing international security.  The United States has long championed the safe, meaningful participation of women in our diplomatic, development, and defense efforts.  As underscored by the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Act of 2017 and our support of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and other relevant WPS resolutions, the United States recognizes and promotes the essential role of women in political and security arenas.  This includes women’s essential role in the prevention, management, and resolution of conflict, and their contributions to stabilization efforts, peacekeeping, and post-conflict relief and recovery.  We also remain firmly committed to advancing the human rights of women and girls as a core element of our foreign policy.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, as well as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of State is proud to release its first public report on the implementation of the 2019 U.S. Strategy on WPS and the Department’s 2020 WPS Implementation Plan.  This marks the first time that the Department has led a comprehensive data-driven monitoring, evaluation, and learning exercise on our WPS efforts.  Over the past year, the Department has made significant progress in implementing this vision, including: support for more than 14,000 women to build capacity for peace and reconciliation, training for more than 43,000 women in security and criminal justice sectors, and support for access to gender-based violence prevention and response services for nearly 488,000 individuals during Fiscal Years 2019 and 2020.  More findings are available at <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/USG-Women-Peace-and-Security-Congressional-Report-June-2021.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/USG-Women-Peace-and-Security-Congressional-Report-June-2021.pdf</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a>.</p>
<p>The United States is proud to continue its long-standing role as a global champion for women on the frontlines of policy, peace, and security decision-making processes and advancing the safety of women and girls.  We know that when women are engaged in peace and security efforts, we are all safer, more prosperous, and more secure.</p>
