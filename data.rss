					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is deeply troubled and disappointed by the court’s decision to convict Osman Kavala today.  His unjust conviction is inconsistent with respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law.  We again call on Turkey to release Osman Kavala, in keeping with European Court of Human Rights rulings, as well as to free all others arbitrarily incarcerated.  We remain gravely concerned by the continued judicial harassment of civil society, media, political and business leaders in Turkey, including through prolonged pretrial detention, overly broad claims of support for terrorism, and criminal insult cases.  The people of Turkey deserve to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms without fear of retribution.  The right to exercise freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association is enshrined in Turkey&#8217;s constitution and its international law obligations and OSCE commitments.  We urge the government to cease politically motivated prosecutions and to respect the rights and freedoms of all Turkish citizens.</p>

<p align="left">Today marks the 33rd birthday of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the 11th Panchen Lama, who remains missing since PRC authorities abducted him as a six-year-old child on May 17, 1995.  The PRC continues to deny members of the Tibetan community access to the Dalai Lama-designated Panchen Lama, the second most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism, and instead continues to promote a state-selected proxy.</p>
<p align="left">We urge PRC authorities to account for Gedhun Choekyi Nyima’s whereabouts and well-being immediately and to allow him to fully exercise his human rights and fundamental freedoms, in line with the PRC’s international commitments.  The United States supports Tibetans’ religious freedom and their unique religious, cultural, and linguistic identity, including Tibetans’ right to select, educate, and venerate their own leaders, like the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, according to their own beliefs and without government interference.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The following is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III visited Kyiv, Ukraine yesterday to demonstrate the United States’ unwavering commitment to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in their struggle against Russian aggression.</p>
<p>While in Kyiv, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, Head of Presidential Administration Andriy Yermak, Chief of Defense General Valeriy Zaluzhny, and Ambassador Oksana Markarova. They discussed America’s stalwart support for the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian people, including through our significant assistance to Ukraine’s security, governance, economic, and humanitarian needs. Secretary Blinken also voiced renewed support for Ukraine’s efforts to end the Russian aggression through diplomacy and dialogue, noting that our continued support will strengthen Ukraine’s hand on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.</p>
<p>During their meeting, Secretary Blinken shared that President Biden will nominate Bridget Brink, currently the U.S. Ambassador to Slovakia, to be the next U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. If confirmed, Ambassador Brink will lead our diplomatic mission in Ukraine with dedication and distinction. She previously served as Senior Advisor and Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs and as the Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassies in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and Tbilisi, Georgia. Her decades of experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraine’s history.</p>
<p>Underscoring our intensive diplomatic engagement, Secretary Blinken also relayed that U.S. diplomats will be returning to Ukraine this week. The increased U.S. presence demonstrates our support for Ukraine and is part of the U.S. commitment to return our diplomats to our Embassy in Kyiv as soon as possible. This action will strengthen the Department’s ongoing commitment to facilitate humanitarian relief efforts and the delivery of assistance to the Government of Ukraine, while providing enhanced support to U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken informed President Zelenskyy that the United States intends to obligate more than $713 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Ukraine and 15 other Allied and partner nations in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkan region. This includes $650 million in funding provided by the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022. More than $322 million in this obligation is for Ukraine and will provide support for the capabilities Ukraine needs as Russia’s forces train their focus on the Donbas; this assistance will also help Ukraine’s armed forces transition to more advanced weapons and air defense systems. This assistance will also help NATO Allies with backfilling capabilities they have donated to Ukraine from their own stockpiles. Additionally, Secretary Blinken told President Zelenskyy that on April 24 the Department notified Congress of a Foreign Military Sale of up to $165 million for non-standard ammunition for Ukraine. Since the start of Russia’s renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the United States has committed roughly $3.7 billion in security assistance and has provided more than $4.3 billion since the start of the Biden Administration.</p>
<p>As part of our continuing assistance, Secretary Austin also informed the Government of Ukraine that the U.S. Department of Defense will expand military training for Ukrainian service members in the region on certain weapons systems being provided. He highlighted U.S. efforts to accelerate the delivery of these weapons, which are now arriving within days of announcement. And he underscored that, along with our Allies and partners, the United States will continue to coordinate the shipment of additional heavy weaponry, ammunition and spare parts from other nations. Secretary Austin also previewed for Ukrainian leaders the agenda for this week’s Defense Consultative Meeting in Germany. Convened by the United States, the Consultative Meeting will examine the operational picture on the ground and review near-term Ukrainian defense needs, while providing attendees an opportunity to examine ways in which Ukraine’s longer term national security interests can be best met.</p>
<p>Both Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin shared their admiration for the everyday heroism exhibited by the Ukrainian people – whether the soldier on the frontlines, those who are ministering the wounded, sick, or vulnerable or the defiant grandmothers resisting Russian aggression. They noted that the bravery of Ukrainians in defending freedom and democracy inspires us all and underscored our confidence that an even stronger Ukraine will emerge from this conflict.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Wendy R. Sherman, Deputy Secretary of State</p>
<p>Stefano Sannino, EEAS Secretary General</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p><strong>Peter Stano, Moderator:</strong> Dear colleagues, thank you very much for coming. Let me welcome our main speakers today. The Deputy Secretary of State of the United States of America Wendy Sherman and Secretary General of the European External Action Service Stefano Sannino who held very intensive consultations in the framework of the EU-U.S. consultations about a number of issues.</p>
<p>They will be briefing you about the content of the consultations and then we will take a few questions. First, we will start with opening remarks and then we open the floor to your questions. We have to finish at 11:50, so we will try to keep the discipline and based on the time we will see how many questions we will take. We will take questions from the room and if possible, because we have some technical problems with the colleagues connected, then we will try also to take questions from the colleagues who are connected online.</p>
<p>So with this, Stefano, I turn the floor over to you.</p>
<p><strong>Secretary General Sannino:</strong> Thank you very much, Peter, and I am happy that we are inaugurating this room with you, Wendy. I think it’s as it should be.</p>
<p>We often speak about the fact that the relationship between EU and U.S. is unique and I think that in a way, not only today but even through the work that we’ve done yesterday and today, we are showing in a very concrete and tangible way the fruit of this sentence.</p>
<p>It is unique not only for what we share, but I would say it is unique also for the way we share things together. I’m also very grateful to you personally, Wendy, for what you bring also personally to this.</p>
<p>This meeting was taking place in a moment which is very specific. Unfortunately, against a background of the events in Ukraine, following the aggression by Russia to this country. And it was, I think, a very important moment to bring together the two sides of the Atlantic in order to have a reflection on what this new situation has generated in the world in general and more specifically in key areas like the one of the Indo-Pacific and China.</p>
<p>This is the third round of the consultation that we have on the dialogue that we have on China. The second on the Indo-Pacific. All this to say that there is a lot of work that has already gone into this relationship, but there is also work in front of us. And I have to say that progressively we are bringing also substance into this work with the concrete activities that we are developing together.</p>
<p>I have to start certainly with the fact that we were sharing very much the sense that Russia has started an aggression towards an independent country, and I would say that this is even particularly worrying because Russia is one of the permanent members of the Security Council and as such it should act in a responsible way. That’s what one would expect from a permanent member of the Security Council, and it’s also what we hope that China will do, will continue to work in a responsible manner. Because it is evident that we need to be sure that, in this new rapprochement between Russia and China, this is not going against the decision that has been taken in terms of circumvention of sanctions or in terms of any other kind of support that could be given to Russia.</p>
<p>We also, when it comes to China, believe that it is extremely important that we continue to work in a way that is not creating imbalances in the Taiwan Strait and that peace and stability is maintained in the region.</p>
<p>Another important point that we have made and for us is essential is the work that we need to put together in the multilateral fora and the fact that China cannot use economic coercion against countries.</p>
<p>We have also noted the situation in Xinjiang and the issue of human rights, child labor rights. And we will continue to follow very closely all these elements.</p>
<p>On the Indo-Pacific, I would just like to mention that we have identified a number of areas where we can work together. Connectivity is certainly one of those. Our two strategies are very relevant. Our two strategies for the Indo-Pacific region have many common elements. Maritime security is another area of common interest where we want to work together, as well as disinformation and child labor.</p>
<p>I would like to end just by stressing that on the occasion of this visit we had also a first meeting of the EU-U.S. Dialogue on Security and Defense with the participation of the Department of State and the Department of Defense and the External Action Service, as well as the Commission and the European Defense Agency. This is the first of what I hope is a strong partnership also in the area of security and defense between the EU and the U.S.</p>
<p>And once again, Wendy, thank you very, very much for being with us, for being a driving force in this relationship and in bringing your experience, your wisdom and also your human touch in this common endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>Deputy Secretary Sherman:</strong> Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and thank you all for being here.</p>
<p>I have to begin by thanking my dear friend. One of the joys of my job is to get to know External Action Service Secretary General Stefano Sannino who has become a dear friend and an extraordinary colleague.</p>
<p>We have just completed two and a half days of extremely productive meetings here in Brussels. Yesterday we held the third meeting of the Interagency U.S.-EU Dialogue on China, which Stefano and I inaugurated last May during my very first overseas trip as Deputy Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Earlier today we held the second U.S.-EU High Level Consultation on the Indo-Pacific. And on Wednesday we had a trilateral meeting with NATO Deputy Secretary General Geoană to discuss our continued coordination on Putin’s war of choice against Ukraine.</p>
<p>The European Union is, as Secretary Blinken has often said, “the United States’ partner of first resort.” It is frankly difficult to think of areas where we are not working closely together, consulting with each other and working to identify shared approaches. That’s the case on energy security; on the climate crisis and sustainable infrastructure; on trade, economic growth and technology; on shaping the rules of the road for the digital economy; and so much more.</p>
<p>And of course, we are working in lockstep to support Ukraine and its people and to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin and his enablers accountable for his premeditated, unprovoked, unjustified, and utterly horrifying war of choice against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Over the last six weeks the United States and our allies and partners, Europe chief among them, have worked in a coordinated fashion to impose unprecedented sanctions, export controls and other measures on Putin and his enablers. These measures are creating severe costs and consequences for the Kremlin. We have also surged lethal defensive aid and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Just yesterday President Biden announced another drawdown of $800 million in additional military assistance to Ukraine, which brings total U.S. security assistance to Ukraine to more than $4 billion since the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration.</p>
<p>He also announced another $500 million in direct economic assistance to the Ukrainian government and he announced additional steps to streamline the process for Ukrainians seeking humanitarian parole or visas to the United States.</p>
<p>We applaud the European Union and the nations of Europe for the actions they have taken to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine and to welcome the more than five million Ukrainians who have now been forced to flee their country.</p>
<p>Putin’s war against Ukraine is not only a threat to European security and stability, it is a threat to the entire world because when autocrats like Putin believe they can act with impunity to dictate another country’s political choices or to change the boundaries of another country by force, or to choose another country’s alliances for them, that makes all of us less secure.</p>
<p>So, even as we work to respond to Putin’s war against Ukraine, we are continuing our work together to uphold and strengthen the rules-based international order, the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p>To that end we also discussed the People’s Republic of China (PRC) over these last two and a half days. The PRC has benefited enormously from the rules-based international order over the last several decades, but now they are increasingly seeking to undermine that very system including by supporting the Kremlin as it wages its illegal war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Less than three weeks before the war began, Putin and PRC President Xi Jinping declared in a joint statement that the PRC and Russia have a “no limits partnership” with “no forbidden areas” of cooperation.</p>
<p>Since then, the PRC has failed to condemn Russian war crimes and voted against the resolution to expel Russia from the Human Rights Council. They have repeatedly drawn false equivalencies between Russia’s war of aggression and Ukraine’s self-defensive actions. PRC state media has parroted the Kremlin’s lies and conspiracy theories, including absurd claims that Ukraine and NATO and the EU pose a security threat to Russia, spreading disinformation both within the PRC itself and in other countries around the world.</p>
<p>We also discussed our many shared concerns about the PRC’s actions, including its use of trade and economic practices that distort markets and harm workers and businesses; its violations of human rights in Xinjiang and elsewhere; and its attempts to use economic coercion to shape the political choices of Lithuania and other countries in Europe and around the world.</p>
<p>The United States sees significant alignment between our approach and the EU’s approach to the PRC, which is reflected in the very strong and substantive Joint Statement that we issued just a bit ago. None of us are looking to hold the PRC down or to prevent continued growth in the PRC, but it is essential that all countries compete according to the same rules of the road on a level playing field. That includes the PRC.</p>
<p>We went on today to continue our consultations on the Indo-Pacific and to look at the broader region and the areas that Stefano outlined of our common work together. We have made unbelievable progress in doing concrete, joint work with each other since the first consultation which just happened a short time ago.</p>
<p>So, I look forward to welcoming Stefano and his team back to Washington again later this year for the next round of these important conversations, and to all the ways we will continue to work together in the meantime.</p>
<p>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you very much. We start with the first question, Agence Europe, Lea Marchal.</p>
<p><strong>Agence Europe:</strong> Thank you very much. I have a question on the Indo-Pacific Dialogue.</p>
<p>Are there particular ideas that you discussed during your conversations to address countries outside China to make sure that you gather support in this region? You mentioned connectivity, you mentioned the maritime sector, but could you maybe develop a little bit on what concrete areas of cooperation could be? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Secretary General Sannino:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>
<p>On connectivity, we have two strategies which are very similar because they are value-based in the sense that we want to have sustainable projects. We just don’t want to pour money into the region without knowing how this is going to be spent. We want to do it in close cooperation with the countries. But we do not want to just finance unsustainable projects &#8212; economically, socially, environmentally.</p>
<p>From that point of view, we have agreed to talk to each other and to make sure that what we do is aligned. We want to make sure that we can maximize the impact of our work in this area.</p>
<p>When it comes to disinformation, for example, we want to have a disinformation hub in the region. We want to try to support media literacy and make sure that there is an impact in the capability to counter the narratives that very often is coming in a distorted way from countries or institutions that are affecting or want to affect the development in the region.</p>
<p>So concrete areas of activity. Coordination, for example, on Myanmar where we have coordinated our position vis-à-vis the country. Trying to give a clear sense of our common work.</p>
<p><strong>Deputy Secretary Sherman:</strong> The only thing I would add to all of those areas &#8211; we did have a discussion about many individual countries and our strategies in each one and where we could collaborate to make further progress. They range everywhere from India to the Philippines to the Pacific Islands to Vietnam.</p>
<p>We both believe in ASEAN’s centrality and discussed the important regional organizations and collaborating in common cause to help prosperity, sustainability, human rights and economic development, humanitarian efforts in a full range of countries.</p>
<p>There were very detailed discussions also, as was mentioned earlier, discussions about child labor, about maritime security, things that we might do together to ensure freedom of navigation and the passage of commerce in a way that ensures that business can get done, supply chains can be renewed, and all of our citizens can have a good and positive future.</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you very much. We go to David .</p>
<p><strong>Politico:</strong> Thanks very much. David Herszenhorn with Politico.</p>
<p>Madame Deputy Secretary, I wonder if you could talk about, we’ve seen the impunity with which Putin has been able to act is partly because Russia has a nuclear arsenal and the reluctance of the U.S. and its allies to intervene more directly because it’s a nuclear power.</p>
<p>What are the implications for say, Beijing, if it were to take military action against Taiwan? What are the messages both in the actions by Russia and in the response from the West? And for other countries in terms of deterrence and nonproliferation policies in terms of other aspiring nuclear powers.</p>
<p>And Mr. Secretary General, you mentioned the particular problem of Russia in the Security Council at the UN. Do you envision the EU becoming a more active advocate for Security Council reform? Maybe the French seat should be an EU seat? Is there a need for modernization on that front?</p>
<p><strong>Deputy Secretary Sherman:</strong> He’s trying to cause trouble .</p>
<p>First of all, there’s a premise in your question that I don’t agree with. The United States and our allies and partners have not sent troops themselves into Ukraine not because of the nuclear arsenal but because, what we believe is most useful is for us to support Ukraine to defend itself, to provide them with the security assistance they need. And so far, the United States alone has provided $4 billion in security assistance. European Union countries have similarly done an extraordinary job. And countries all over the world have changed their rules, their laws to provide security assistance to Ukraine as well.</p>
<p>The President of the United States has said that if there is any attempt to take any NATO territory, our troops will be there as part of NATO in a nano-second.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I quite agree with you about the seriousness of any country who might decide that there is such a thing as non-strategic tactical nuclear weapons. In my own view, any kind of nuclear weapon is inherently escalatory and therefore inherently strategic. And the President of the United States and Secretary Blinken have made it quite clear that if Vladimir Putin decides to use such a weapon, and we hope that he does not, that there will be severe consequences. And there is no doubt that it will change the world in significant ways should that happen.</p>
<p>I would also agree with you that nonproliferation policy is extremely critical today. That was in part what the strategic stability dialogue between the United States and Russia was all about, was to create stability. We had done it successfully with the New START Agreement and the renewal of New START. We were in the midst of very substantive conversations when Vladimir Putin decided that he thought Ukraine belonged to him and took this premeditated, unprovoked and unjust invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>I certainly hope that the PRC takes the right lessons out of the Russia-Ukraine crisis and that they understand that the United States, our allies and partners will not be divided by anyone. We will act in concert, we will act swiftly, we will act decidedly, and we will support countries’ sovereignty, territorial integrity and their right to choose their own alliances and their own political future.</p>
<p><strong>Politico:</strong> The premise was based partly on the difference in response compared to say Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo. .</p>
<p><strong>Deputy Secretary Sherman:</strong> Also at a different time in history.</p>
<p><strong>Secretary General Sannino:</strong> There is a discussion which is going on, by the way, which is quite interesting in the UN about what to do when the Security Council is blocked and how to use more and more proactive the General Assembly from that perspective. We have seen that when the solutions on Ukraine were blocked in the Security Council, we have moved to the General Assembly with a political impact which has been I would say very, very relevant.</p>
<p>So the question now, speaking about the reform of the Security Council and Europeanizing the French seat, I think it is more how to ensure that the UN can continue to be effective in guaranteeing peace and security in the world. And that is a responsibility of the UN, it is the responsibility of the Security Council and its members, the responsibility of the Secretary General and of the General Assembly.</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you very much. We try colleagues from Webex. Finbarr, we will try to open your microphone and you can ask your question. If we don’t succeed with the sound then I will read it out, but first you try.</p>
<p>I see your microphone is open, but it’s muted, so I will read it in my strange Slovak accent, your question.</p>
<p>This is a question for the Deputy Secretary of State: yesterday you said that U.S. leadership had relayed in detail to Beijing the consequences if China provides support to Russia. Are the EU and U.S. on the same page on what these consequences might be? Has this been agreed this week in your consultations? Are you ready to act in tandem as the U.S. and the European Union should China be found to circumvent sanctions or provide military or financial support to Russia?</p>
<p><strong>Deputy Secretary Sherman:</strong> First of all, what I said yesterday was not that we have relayed in detail what we would do if the PRC provided material support to Russia. We told them in detail what our sanctions, export controls and designations were on Russia so they understood what we had done and how our sanctions, export controls and visa regimes work.</p>
<p>What they take from that, I hope, is an appreciation of the depth and breadth of the actions that we can take not only unilaterally but in concert with our allies and partners, in the first instance with Europe and with European Union, but more broadly all around the world. No one should forget that 141 countries voted to condemn Russia’s aggression at the UN. This is a worldwide condemnation of what has occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> We take a last question, Eireni .</p>
<p><strong>ERT:</strong> Eireni Zarkadoula with the Republic TV and Athens News Agency.</p>
<p>Are there any clear indications that China is willing to cooperate or to contribute to the efforts made by the United States and the European Union to stop the war in Ukraine and what President Biden has called a “genocide”? Or they keep helping in their own way Russia? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Secretary General Sannino:</strong> Wendy was also already mentioning the joint statement of President Xi and President Putin and also the unconditional support that they are giving to each other. This is something that is extremely worrying and certainly something that, we believe, is not going, is not in line with what China has always claimed of being a responsible superpower, supporting stability in world. And, since it is evident that this is a war of aggression, it’s a contradiction from that. It’s there from many points of view.</p>
<p>For the time being, we have not seen specific elements that could give the sense that they are supporting, beyond words and beyond what they are doing in the UN, Russia. We will continue insisting as we have been doing during this summit between the EU and China, we continue insisting about the importance of not providing any possibility of circumventing sanctions and not providing any military support to Russia.</p>
<p>Certainly, we would like much more to have a clear statement by China that this war is a war of aggression and that there is a responsibility that President Putin is having in waging this war.</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you very much, we have to finish. In the meantime, the joint press release is out on both the State Department website and the EEAS website. So, thank you very much for coming and have a nice weekend everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wendy R. Sherman, Deputy Secretary of State</p>
<p>Stefano Sannino, EEAS Secretary General</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p><strong>Peter Stano, Moderator:</strong> Dear colleagues, thank you very much for coming. Let me welcome our main speakers today. The Deputy Secretary of State of the United States of America Wendy Sherman and Secretary General of the European External Action Service Stefano Sannino who held very intensive consultations in the framework of the EU-U.S. consultations about a number of issues.</p>
<p>They will be briefing you about the content of the consultations and then we will take a few questions. First, we will start with opening remarks and then we open the floor to your questions. We have to finish at 11:50, so we will try to keep the discipline and based on the time we will see how many questions we will take. We will take questions from the room and if possible, because we have some technical problems with the colleagues connected, then we will try also to take questions from the colleagues who are connected online.</p>
<p>So with this, Stefano, I turn the floor over to you.</p>
<p><strong>Secretary General Sannino:</strong> Thank you very much, Peter, and I am happy that we are inaugurating this room with you, Wendy. I think it’s as it should be.</p>
<p>We often speak about the fact that the relationship between EU and U.S. is unique and I think that in a way, not only today but even through the work that we’ve done yesterday and today, we are showing in a very concrete and tangible way the fruit of this sentence.</p>
<p>It is unique not only for what we share, but I would say it is unique also for the way we share things together. I’m also very grateful to you personally, Wendy, for what you bring also personally to this.</p>
<p>This meeting was taking place in a moment which is very specific. Unfortunately, against a background of the events in Ukraine, following the aggression by Russia to this country. And it was, I think, a very important moment to bring together the two sides of the Atlantic in order to have a reflection on what this new situation has generated in the world in general and more specifically in key areas like the one of the Indo-Pacific and China.</p>
<p>This is the third round of the consultation that we have on the dialogue that we have on China. The second on the Indo-Pacific. All this to say that there is a lot of work that has already gone into this relationship, but there is also work in front of us. And I have to say that progressively we are bringing also substance into this work with the concrete activities that we are developing together.</p>
<p>I have to start certainly with the fact that we were sharing very much the sense that Russia has started an aggression towards an independent country, and I would say that this is even particularly worrying because Russia is one of the permanent members of the Security Council and as such it should act in a responsible way. That’s what one would expect from a permanent member of the Security Council, and it’s also what we hope that China will do, will continue to work in a responsible manner. Because it is evident that we need to be sure that, in this new rapprochement between Russia and China, this is not going against the decision that has been taken in terms of circumvention of sanctions or in terms of any other kind of support that could be given to Russia.</p>
<p>We also, when it comes to China, believe that it is extremely important that we continue to work in a way that is not creating imbalances in the Taiwan Strait and that peace and stability is maintained in the region.</p>
<p>Another important point that we have made and for us is essential is the work that we need to put together in the multilateral fora and the fact that China cannot use economic coercion against countries.</p>
<p>We have also noted the situation in Xinjiang and the issue of human rights, child labor rights. And we will continue to follow very closely all these elements.</p>
<p>On the Indo-Pacific, I would just like to mention that we have identified a number of areas where we can work together. Connectivity is certainly one of those. Our two strategies are very relevant. Our two strategies for the Indo-Pacific region have many common elements. Maritime security is another area of common interest where we want to work together, as well as disinformation and child labor.</p>
<p>I would like to end just by stressing that on the occasion of this visit we had also a first meeting of the EU-U.S. Dialogue on Security and Defense with the participation of the Department of State and the Department of Defense and the External Action Service, as well as the Commission and the European Defense Agency. This is the first of what I hope is a strong partnership also in the area of security and defense between the EU and the U.S.</p>
<p>And once again, Wendy, thank you very, very much for being with us, for being a driving force in this relationship and in bringing your experience, your wisdom and also your human touch in this common endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>Deputy Secretary Sherman:</strong> Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and thank you all for being here.</p>
<p>I have to begin by thanking my dear friend. One of the joys of my job is to get to know External Action Service Secretary General Stefano Sannino who has become a dear friend and an extraordinary colleague.</p>
<p>We have just completed two and a half days of extremely productive meetings here in Brussels. Yesterday we held the third meeting of the Interagency U.S.-EU Dialogue on China, which Stefano and I inaugurated last May during my very first overseas trip as Deputy Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Earlier today we held the second U.S.-EU High Level Consultation on the Indo-Pacific. And on Wednesday we had a trilateral meeting with NATO Deputy Secretary General Geoană to discuss our continued coordination on Putin’s war of choice against Ukraine.</p>
<p>The European Union is, as Secretary Blinken has often said, “the United States’ partner of first resort.” It is frankly difficult to think of areas where we are not working closely together, consulting with each other and working to identify shared approaches. That’s the case on energy security; on the climate crisis and sustainable infrastructure; on trade, economic growth and technology; on shaping the rules of the road for the digital economy; and so much more.</p>
<p>And of course, we are working in lockstep to support Ukraine and its people and to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin and his enablers accountable for his premeditated, unprovoked, unjustified, and utterly horrifying war of choice against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Over the last six weeks the United States and our allies and partners, Europe chief among them, have worked in a coordinated fashion to impose unprecedented sanctions, export controls and other measures on Putin and his enablers. These measures are creating severe costs and consequences for the Kremlin. We have also surged lethal defensive aid and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Just yesterday President Biden announced another drawdown of $800 million in additional military assistance to Ukraine, which brings total U.S. security assistance to Ukraine to more than $4 billion since the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration.</p>
<p>He also announced another $500 million in direct economic assistance to the Ukrainian government and he announced additional steps to streamline the process for Ukrainians seeking humanitarian parole or visas to the United States.</p>
<p>We applaud the European Union and the nations of Europe for the actions they have taken to provide defensive assistance to Ukraine and to welcome the more than five million Ukrainians who have now been forced to flee their country.</p>
<p>Putin’s war against Ukraine is not only a threat to European security and stability, it is a threat to the entire world because when autocrats like Putin believe they can act with impunity to dictate another country’s political choices or to change the boundaries of another country by force, or to choose another country’s alliances for them, that makes all of us less secure.</p>
<p>So, even as we work to respond to Putin’s war against Ukraine, we are continuing our work together to uphold and strengthen the rules-based international order, the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p>To that end we also discussed the People’s Republic of China (PRC) over these last two and a half days. The PRC has benefited enormously from the rules-based international order over the last several decades, but now they are increasingly seeking to undermine that very system including by supporting the Kremlin as it wages its illegal war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Less than three weeks before the war began, Putin and PRC President Xi Jinping declared in a joint statement that the PRC and Russia have a “no limits partnership” with “no forbidden areas” of cooperation.</p>
<p>Since then, the PRC has failed to condemn Russian war crimes and voted against the resolution to expel Russia from the Human Rights Council. They have repeatedly drawn false equivalencies between Russia’s war of aggression and Ukraine’s self-defensive actions. PRC state media has parroted the Kremlin’s lies and conspiracy theories, including absurd claims that Ukraine and NATO and the EU pose a security threat to Russia, spreading disinformation both within the PRC itself and in other countries around the world.</p>
<p>We also discussed our many shared concerns about the PRC’s actions, including its use of trade and economic practices that distort markets and harm workers and businesses; its violations of human rights in Xinjiang and elsewhere; and its attempts to use economic coercion to shape the political choices of Lithuania and other countries in Europe and around the world.</p>
<p>The United States sees significant alignment between our approach and the EU’s approach to the PRC, which is reflected in the very strong and substantive Joint Statement that we issued just a bit ago. None of us are looking to hold the PRC down or to prevent continued growth in the PRC, but it is essential that all countries compete according to the same rules of the road on a level playing field. That includes the PRC.</p>
<p>We went on today to continue our consultations on the Indo-Pacific and to look at the broader region and the areas that Stefano outlined of our common work together. We have made unbelievable progress in doing concrete, joint work with each other since the first consultation which just happened a short time ago.</p>
<p>So, I look forward to welcoming Stefano and his team back to Washington again later this year for the next round of these important conversations, and to all the ways we will continue to work together in the meantime.</p>
<p>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you very much. We start with the first question, Agence Europe, Lea Marchal.</p>
<p><strong>Agence Europe:</strong> Thank you very much. I have a question on the Indo-Pacific Dialogue.</p>
<p>Are there particular ideas that you discussed during your conversations to address countries outside China to make sure that you gather support in this region? You mentioned connectivity, you mentioned the maritime sector, but could you maybe develop a little bit on what concrete areas of cooperation could be? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Secretary General Sannino:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>
<p>On connectivity, we have two strategies which are very similar because they are value-based in the sense that we want to have sustainable projects. We just don’t want to pour money into the region without knowing how this is going to be spent. We want to do it in close cooperation with the countries. But we do not want to just finance unsustainable projects &#8212; economically, socially, environmentally.</p>
<p>From that point of view, we have agreed to talk to each other and to make sure that what we do is aligned. We want to make sure that we can maximize the impact of our work in this area.</p>
<p>When it comes to disinformation, for example, we want to have a disinformation hub in the region. We want to try to support media literacy and make sure that there is an impact in the capability to counter the narratives that very often is coming in a distorted way from countries or institutions that are affecting or want to affect the development in the region.</p>
<p>So concrete areas of activity. Coordination, for example, on Myanmar where we have coordinated our position vis-à-vis the country. Trying to give a clear sense of our common work.</p>
<p><strong>Deputy Secretary Sherman:</strong> The only thing I would add to all of those areas &#8211; we did have a discussion about many individual countries and our strategies in each one and where we could collaborate to make further progress. They range everywhere from India to the Philippines to the Pacific Islands to Vietnam.</p>
<p>We both believe in ASEAN’s centrality and discussed the important regional organizations and collaborating in common cause to help prosperity, sustainability, human rights and economic development, humanitarian efforts in a full range of countries.</p>
<p>There were very detailed discussions also, as was mentioned earlier, discussions about child labor, about maritime security, things that we might do together to ensure freedom of navigation and the passage of commerce in a way that ensures that business can get done, supply chains can be renewed, and all of our citizens can have a good and positive future.</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you very much. We go to David .</p>
<p><strong>Politico:</strong> Thanks very much. David Herszenhorn with Politico.</p>
<p>Madame Deputy Secretary, I wonder if you could talk about, we’ve seen the impunity with which Putin has been able to act is partly because Russia has a nuclear arsenal and the reluctance of the U.S. and its allies to intervene more directly because it’s a nuclear power.</p>
<p>What are the implications for say, Beijing, if it were to take military action against Taiwan? What are the messages both in the actions by Russia and in the response from the West? And for other countries in terms of deterrence and nonproliferation policies in terms of other aspiring nuclear powers.</p>
<p>And Mr. Secretary General, you mentioned the particular problem of Russia in the Security Council at the UN. Do you envision the EU becoming a more active advocate for Security Council reform? Maybe the French seat should be an EU seat? Is there a need for modernization on that front?</p>
<p><strong>Deputy Secretary Sherman:</strong> He’s trying to cause trouble .</p>
<p>First of all, there’s a premise in your question that I don’t agree with. The United States and our allies and partners have not sent troops themselves into Ukraine not because of the nuclear arsenal but because, what we believe is most useful is for us to support Ukraine to defend itself, to provide them with the security assistance they need. And so far, the United States alone has provided $4 billion in security assistance. European Union countries have similarly done an extraordinary job. And countries all over the world have changed their rules, their laws to provide security assistance to Ukraine as well.</p>
<p>The President of the United States has said that if there is any attempt to take any NATO territory, our troops will be there as part of NATO in a nano-second.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I quite agree with you about the seriousness of any country who might decide that there is such a thing as non-strategic tactical nuclear weapons.

<p>I certainly hope that the PRC takes the right lessons out of the Russia-Ukraine crisis and that they understand that the United States, our allies and partners will not be divided by anyone. We will act in concert, we will act swiftly, we will act decidedly, and we will support countries’ sovereignty, territorial integrity and their right to choose their own alliances and their own political future.</p>
<p><strong>Politico:</strong> The premise was based partly on the difference in response compared to say Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo. .</p>

<p>So the question now, speaking about the reform of the Security Council and Europeanizing the French seat, I think it is more how to ensure that the UN can continue to be effective in guaranteeing peace and security in the world. And that is a responsibility of the UN, it is the responsibility of the Security Council and its members, the responsibility of the Secretary General and of the General Assembly.</p>
<p><strong>Moderator:</strong> Thank you very much. We try colleagues from Webex. Finbarr, we will try to open your microphone and you can ask your question. If we don’t succeed with the sound then I will read it out, but first you try.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It’s a pleasure to welcome Ukraine’s prime minister here to the State Department after a couple of days in Washington, most notably with President Biden.  I had a chance to visit with the prime minister before Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and I’m very pleased to be able to receive you now here.  I think this is the first visit since the Russian aggression by a senior official of the Ukrainian Government, further evidence that a independent, sovereign Ukraine is going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>We continue to work to support Ukraine with the assistance that it needs – military, economic, humanitarian.  We continue in coordination with allies and partners as well to exert significant pressure on Russia to end the aggression, and of course, we continue to take steps to shore up the defense of our NATO Alliance.  But I’m looking forward to having an opportunity to hear from the prime minister about all of these ongoing efforts and what we can continue to do to support Ukraine in its fight for independence, for sovereignty – a fight that it will win.</p>
<p>Mr. Prime Minister.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER SHMYHAL:</strong>  Your Excellency (inaudible).  It’s an honor to be here.  My country now is on the 58th day of war, and United States support Ukraine so much, so strong.  We feel this support because – weapon, financial support, and the personal involvement of President of United States, your personal involvement in support of Ukraine.  It’s – we feel it, we appreciate it so much, and we are really grateful to you and to your people, to your country for support of us before the face of this bloody war from Russian side.  So, they really make atrocities, they make war crimes in our country, but we have support of all civilized world.  We feel it, and we would like – and we absolutely sure that we will win in this war.  There is no other way for us and for all civilized world.</p>
<p>So, during my visit to here, we have absolutely amazing meeting with President Biden.  I am sure that today we also will have very fruitful and productive meeting.  Yesterday, we have many, many meetings, including a roundtable with all ministers of finances from all around the world.  We also discuss possibility of supporting of Ukraine before the face of this war.  So, thank you for this possibility because this visit is absolutely fruitful, absolutely fulfilled by very important meetings.  And I am sure that after this visit and during the next day, days, weeks, and months, Ukraine will win.  We’ll have absolutely perfect recovery plan.  And we will fulfill the recovery funds with proper finances.</p>
<p>For our support, we need – we strongly need four things, and I (inaudible) communicated with all of our counterparts during all of our meetings.  The first one is ammunition and weapon because we should stop aggressor on the – our borders and don’t let them to go to the democratic Europe, to European countries.  The second, is sanctions because it’s the most important instrument of influence of the – on the aggressor.  The third one is financing; it will let us and will help us to save macroeconomical stability of our country, to execute our humanitarian and social responsibilities from the side of our state.  And the fourth, very important issue is our European perspectives, because the biggest of – the biggest quantity of our people, more than 96 percent of Ukrainians, strongly would like to be part of European family, part of civilized world, but not part of Soviet Union or a Russian empire.</p>
<p>So, it’s very important for us, and because of this, many of our young guys and girls pay their lives in this war for this Ukrainian perspectives – European perspectives, and civilized perspectives.  So, thank you so much for this strong support, for sustainable support of our country before the face of this war, and in our development.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you very much.</p>

<p>While in Cox’s Bazar, Ambassador Hussain visited Rohingya refugee camps to learn first-hand about the challenges Rohingya have faced since fleeing brutal violence and persecution in Burma and how the United States can support them.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>For over a decade, the Greening Diplomacy Initiative (GDI) has catalyzed climate solutions within the U.S. State Department’s management and operations to help conserve natural and financial resources, build climate resilience, and showcase U.S. innovation.  The winners of the 2022 GDI Awards highlight the teams and individuals who have best exemplified the U.S. and GDI commitment to lead by example in addressing the climate crisis.</p>
<p>U.S. Embassy Baku is the winner of the 2022 GDI Award for Excellence in Team Sustainability Performance.  Embassy Baku developed a strong Green Team with cooperation and action at every level across the embassy.  Among their accomplishments, the Embassy expanded its recycling program, and put the proceeds from the sale of recyclables toward supporting environment-related community activities.  The Embassy was also the first diplomatic mission in Azerbaijan to purchase a fully electric vehicle, which can help reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  To showcase the benefits of going electric, the embassy filmed a <a href="https://az.usembassy.gov/ev-karaoke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA0MjIuNTY4MzA3MzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2F6LnVzZW1iYXNzeS5nb3YvZXYta2FyYW9rZS8ifQ.bGXtYi6W0TGBrj0nJ5C8B9dD9Fc9QwN3qR0lLuyGrGI/s/1006560560/br/130234041958-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1650734733659000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2S-XN17mI1Fl0mDM76K89x">carpool karaoke video</a> in the vehicle.  The embassy also started informing residents of their utility consumption and ways to reduce their energy and water use; installed an air quality monitor to provide data that will drive personnel health decisions and engagement with the local government on air quality issues; and planted 355 trees, one for each of their Locally Engaged Staff.</p>
<p>Over 1,400 Department employees voted for their top choice among the team nominees, electing the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) as the winner of the 2022 People’s Choice Award for Team Sustainability Performance.  CA converted paper inserts mailed with new passport issuances into QR code stickers, eliminating approximately 20,000 boxes and 600,000 pounds of material per year and saving the Department around $1 million annually.  The effort also reduces the Department’s environmental footprint by eliminating emissions associated with transportation of the paper inserts.</p>
<p>Jenna Faupel, an Energy Manager from the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations, is the winner of the GDI Award for Excellence in Individual Sustainability Leadership for Domestic U.S. Direct Hires.  She pioneered the Department’s transition to EnergyCAP, a system that automates capturing utility bills.  Through her tireless efforts over the last two years, she helped enroll 244 embassies and consulates and captured data from over 630 service providers in 45 languages and 106 currencies.  Going a step further, Jenna also started analysis of utility bills and has already saved $74,000 annually and identified over $500,000 in potential annual savings.</p>
<p>Olivia Fisher, the Facility Manager at U.S. Embassy Asuncion, is the winner of the GDI Award for Excellence in Individual Sustainability Leadership for Overseas U.S. Direct Hires.  Olivia established multiple metrics to develop a power demand profile to plan out energy efficiency projects.  She oversaw the creation the Embassy’s Zero Waste Program which works collaboratively with the local community to ensure proper recycling.  Olivia also incorporated sustainable policies into her facilities team, including green cleaning and preventative maintenance.</p>
<p>Naresh Jindal, an Engineer and Resource Conservation Unit Supervisor at U.S. Embassy New Delhi, is the winner of the GDI Award for Excellence in Individual Sustainability Leadership for Locally Engaged Staff.  Naresh led the Embassy’s effort to dramatically reduce their carbon footprint in 2021.  By implementing a water recovery system, he helped save almost 70,000 gallons of water in the first five months of the project, which expects to save 2.1 million gallons annually.  He has also led efforts to implement several energy saving initiatives including LED lighting transition and installing solar lights and water heaters.  Naresh also established the embassy’s waste recycling center, which recycled 105 tons of waste and brought in $35,000 in 2021. Those funds are being invested in further greening efforts.</p>
