					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State submitted the 2022 edition of the annual International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) to Congress today. This two-volume, Congressionally-mandated report assesses foreign governments’ efforts to reduce illicit drug production, trafficking, and use as well as their work to counter drug trafficking-related money laundering. The INCSR was first published in 1986, and this edition covers calendar year 2021.</p>
<p>This year’s INCSR stresses that the opioid crisis remains a global challenge that requires urgent international action. Synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, continue to claim far too many lives in the United States and represent a growing global threat. The report highlights not only increases in trafficking and abuse of fentanyl and other deadly synthetic opioids across the globe but also concerning levels of overseas production of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. Reducing the global drug threat will require sustained political commitments from partner governments, supported by U.S. assistance, to target all the links in the supplier-to-consumer chain. This means curbing the production of illicit drugs, interdicting drug shipments, tackling illicit finance, and reducing drug demand everywhere.</p>
<p>Volume I of the INCSR, addressing Drugs and Chemical Control, provides an overview of 2021 drug control efforts undertaken by 63 countries. Volume II, Money Laundering, highlights the nature of drug trafficking-related money laundering – and specific vulnerabilities – in 80 countries and jurisdictions as well as these governments’ efforts to strengthen their anti-money laundering regimes.</p>
<p>The full text of INCSR Volumes I and II can be viewed at <a href="https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-international-narcotics-and-law-enforcement-affairs-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-international-narcotics-and-law-enforcement-affairs-releases/</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State is restarting the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) Direct Access Program for U.S.-Affiliated Iraqis (Iraqi P-2 Program). The United States is committed to ensuring those who sacrificed their own safety for our collective interests have an opportunity to seek refuge in the United States. This includes Iraqis who have served alongside U.S. service members.</p>
<p>After an extensive review, we have resumed case processing for a select number of Iraqi P-2 cases that had been previously suspended during our review of the program. In coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, we will continue to review and process all other existing Iraqi P-2 cases that can move forward as well as accept new applications to the program.</p>
<p>During our review of the Iraqi P-2 Program, we identified and resolved the issues that led to our suspension of the program in January of 2021. We are committed to ensuring that only bona fide and qualified Iraqis who supported U.S. efforts in Iraq are considered for this important humanitarian program.</p>
<p>All refugees undergo the highest level of security screening and vetting, including extensive interviews and the vetting of biographic and biometric information. Only after an applicant has cleared all security vetting can they be deemed eligible for admission to the United States. In the admission of refugees to the United States, the safety and security of the American people is our highest priority.</p>

<p>The below is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke today with Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.  Secretary Blinken discussed Russia’s unprovoked, unjustified, and premeditated attack on Ukraine and the importance of respecting the UN Charter’s principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.  He also highlighted that this marks 75 years of the United States and Nepal’s diplomatic relations and noted that Nepal’s decision to move forward with the Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC) would allow the electricity transmission and roads project to create jobs, infrastructure, and improve the lives of the Nepali people.  The Secretary agreed to strengthen efforts to build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic and work toward addressing the climate crisis.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is working with our African partners, including South Africa, to dismantle ISIS financial support networks on the continent.  Today, the United States designated four ISIS and ISIS-Mozambique (ISIS-M) financial facilitators in South Africa.  Farhad Hoomer, Siraaj Miller, Abdella Hussein Abadigga, and Peter Charles Mbaga are being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, which targets terrorist groups and their supporters, among others.</p>
<p>ISIS members and associates in South Africa are playing a role in facilitating the transfer of funds from the top of the ISIS hierarchy to branches across Africa.  Those designated today have provided financial support or served as leaders of ISIS cells in South Africa.  ISIS and ISIS-M are distinct and separately-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTOs) under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended.</p>
<p>ISIS has attempted to expand its influence in Africa through large-scale operations particularly in areas where government control is limited.  ISIS branches in Africa rely on local fundraising schemes such as theft, extortion of local populations, and kidnapping for ransom as well as financial support from the ISIS hierarchy.</p>
<p>We are taking today’s action to further disrupt and expose key ISIS and ISIS-M supporters who raise revenue for ISIS and exploit South Africa’s financial system to facilitate funding for ISIS branches and networks across Africa.</p>
<p>For more information this action, please see the Department of the Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0616" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>
