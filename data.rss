					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>For nearly 12 weeks, Russia has waged its unprovoked and brutal war against Ukraine, its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, and its people.  Beaten back from its failed attempt to seize Kyiv, Russia continues a grinding offensive across Ukraine’s south and east.  Ukraine’s courageous defense forces remain firmly in the fight.  The United States, as well as more than 40 Allies and partner countries, are working around the clock to expedite shipments of arms and equipment essential to Ukraine’s defense.</p>
<p>Pursuant to a delegation from the President, I am authorizing our tenth drawdown of additional arms and equipment for Ukraine’s defense from U.S. Department of Defense inventories, valued at up to $100 million.  This brings total U.S. military assistance to Ukraine to approximately $3.9 billion in arms and equipment since Russia launched its brutal and unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24.</p>
<p>U.S. and international military assistance continues to complement direct U.S. financial support to Ukraine, support for documenting evidence of Russia’s atrocities against the people of Ukraine, and measures to continue ratcheting up the pressure on Russia and its remaining enablers.  Taken together, these efforts strengthen Ukraine’s position at the negotiating table while continuing to isolate Russia from the world until it ends its senseless and brutal war of choice against Ukraine.   The United States is committed to helping Ukraine continue to meet its defense needs and build its future capabilities, as well as to bolster Allies and partners across NATO’s Eastern Flank and the broader region.</p>
<p>The United States, our allies, and our partners are proud to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine in their just cause:  the defense of their country and their democracy.  United with our Allies and partners, we will succeed, and a democratic, sovereign, and independent Ukraine shall prevail.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Hizballah continues to exploit the private sector and commercial activity to fund its illicit and destabilizing activities.  The United States is committed to protecting the international financial system from Hizballah’s abuses and to supporting legitimate businesses in Lebanon, Iraq, and the broader Middle East.  Today, the United States is designating a key Hizballah businessman and financial facilitator, as well as several of his companies and associates in Lebanon and Iraq.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has designated Ahmad Jalal Reda Abdallah and his network of associates and companies under Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended, which targets terrorists, leaders of terrorist groups and other officials, and those providing support to acts of terrorism or to persons blocked under E.O. 13224.  The United States designated Hizballah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997 and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in 2001.</p>
<p>Hizballah structures companies to disguise its ownership and make the companies appear legitimate.  Through actions like those carried out today, we continue to counter Hizballah’s exploitation of businesses to fund its terrorist activities and its efforts to destabilize Lebanon and the wider region.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New York, New York </p>
<p>United States Mission to the UN</p>
<p><b>AMBASSADOR THOMAS-GREENFIELD:</b>  Good morning, everyone, and thank you.  Thank you for sitting.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  I want to start by thanking all of you for making time together today as one mission, and I’m so delighted to see all of you here at one place, at one time.  I think this is our first time getting together officially in person, Mr. Secretary, here on the 22nd floor as a team.  And I can think of no better occasion than to mark our presidency of the Security Council and to welcome Secretary Blinken back to USUN.</p>
<p>Let me take this opportunity to say, as I try to with fervent regularity, how proud I am of every single one of you here in this room.  We’re not done yet, but already it’s been an enormously successful month, from our important meeting on Ukraine, to a renewed focus on Syria, to honoring Secretary Albright at a moving memorial, to shining a spotlight on food insecurity throughout the week.</p>
<p>But I also don’t want to forget what we’ve done for the past year.  We have been on a rollercoaster, sprinting, and we are winning every single race.  And it’s only because of all of you.  So let me just thank all of you and encourage you to give yourself a hand of applause.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>Don’t get too comfortable.  (Laughter.)  Because we’ve got a lot more to come, including our second signature event on the world of digital technologies and the annual debate on the protection of civilians in conflict.  So thank you all for the work that you’ve done this month, every month, to make our work here a success and to advance our values at the UN and around the world.</p>
<p>Now, I’m pleased to introduce a person who needs no introduction, Secretary Blinken, for his second town hall meeting with us.  And I know Secretary Blinken is thrilled to be back in New York today and not just because this is his hometown, but he’s deeply invested in our mission here at the UN.  The Secretary’s eager to share his thoughts and to hear from you, so I’ll turn the floor over to him.  So everyone, please join me in welcoming our Secretary of State.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.  It is wonderful to see everyone in the same place in this spectacular room.  For me, it is always great to be back in New York for that.  Yankees, Giants, Knicks, Rangers.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>AMBASSADOR THOMAS-GREENFIELD:</b>  There you go.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b> Got to get that on the table.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>I just want to start by saying, first of all, thank you to this extraordinary leadership team – Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Ambassador Mills, DeLaurentis, Lu, Carty, and somewhere in here the heart and soul of USUN in Washington, Jeff Prescott.  To each and every one of you, as Linda said, thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>Virtually everything that we are doing, trying to do around the world to benefit the American people, our fellow citizens for the most part, comes together here in this mission.  Whether it’s dealing with COVID, whether it’s dealing with climate, whether it’s figuring out how we shape these emerging technologies, whether it’s grappling with a food security crisis that is taking hold of the world, exacerbated by Russia’s aggression in Ukraine – all of these things and so many more come together here at the United Nations.</p>
<p>And we know, and you know from what you’re doing every single day, that what we’re trying to accomplish for our country, for the American people, can’t effectively be done alone.  We need to be working with others.  We need to find cooperation; we need to find coordination; we need to do consultations.  And again, all of that is happening here.</p>
<p>And as Linda said, it is happening at extraordinary speed, an extraordinary pace.  I know that the – sometimes the worst words in the English language is “Washington’s coming to town.”  So I know how much has gone into just these couple of days and the extraordinary work that’s been packed into a couple of days, particularly the food security work that we’ve been doing yesterday and again today at the Security Council.  And I deeply appreciate all of the effort that’s gone into that.</p>
<p>Getting together with some 30 countries yesterday, also with African ministers, 10 countries, the Security Council meeting today, the migration forum on top of that – all of this made possible, by the way, by the remarkable protocol team, Matthew Miller – are you here, Matthew?  (Applause.)  Protocol is vital everywhere, but probably no more so than right here, and it’s multiplied by almost 200, so we’re really grateful for that.</p>
<p>So many of you also worked this spring to do what many people thought was impossible, which was, again, to help rally the world in opposition to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and in support of Ukraine.  UN resolutions at the General Assembly that got extraordinary support, 140, 141 countries – again, that doesn’t just happen.  It’s because of so much of the work that you’re doing, not just in the moment, but it’s also the product of the work you’re doing every day to build relationships, to build confidence, to build trust.  So again, I deeply appreciate that.</p>
<p>Let me say, too, that I know that even as we’re intensely focused on Ukraine, as I mentioned, there are so many other things going on that you’re taking on every single day.  I have a really hackneyed acronym that my colleagues in Washington are tired of hearing me talk about, but it is, nonetheless, important – ROW, R-O-W, rest of world.  Even if something very intense is going on, like Ukraine, we are, we have to be, focused on the rest of the world, and you’re doing that.  And for those of you who are working different portfolios that may not be in the spotlight at the moment, thank you for what you’re doing.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, even as we’ve been dealing with Ukraine, our diplomacy, including diplomacy that’s been centered here at the UN, has helped get a truce, for the time being at least, in Ethiopia.  And as result, humanitarian assistance is getting up into Tigray.  We helped get a truce in Yemen after eight years, and again, as a result, humanitarian assistance is flowing.  We have maybe a chance for a longer-lasting peace.  More than 500 million COVID vaccines have gotten through to other countries, free of charge, through COVAX, and – with no strings attached.  I could go down a list, but it shows that we are ROW, you are ROW.  You are making a difference every single day.</p>
<p>So I’m grateful to the work that you’re doing.  I really wanted to just come by and say thank you.  I also wanted to say, as Linda said, this the first gathering that you’ve had in this room in a while.  That is because, of course, we’ve all been living with COVID-19 for the last two years.  And I know the disruptive effect that it’s had not only on the way you’ve had to do your work, but for so many of you in your own personal lives.  And some people have been affected directly, and it makes everything that we all do more challenging.  And yet, you’ve come through that with tremendous professionalism and tremendous skill.</p>
<p>So to all of you here, I know being in New York you have the great benefit of being in the city, but I also want you to know you’re a crucial part of what we’re doing in Washington.  We couldn’t do our diplomacy, we couldn’t do our foreign policy, we couldn’t be as effective as we are being without the work that you’re doing.  So simply put, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

<p>Now, I’m pleased to introduce a person who needs no introduction, Secretary Blinken, for his second town hall meeting with us.  And I know Secretary Blinken is thrilled to be back in New York today and not just because this is his hometown, but he’s deeply invested in our mission here at the UN.  The Secretary’s eager to share his thoughts and to hear from you, so I’ll turn the floor over to him.  So everyone, please join me in welcoming our Secretary of State.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.  It is wonderful to see everyone in the same place in this spectacular room.  For me, it is always great to be back in New York for that.  Yankees, Giants, Knicks, Rangers.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>AMBASSADOR THOMAS-GREENFIELD:</b>  There you go.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b> Got to get that on the table.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>I just want to start by saying, first of all, thank you to this extraordinary leadership team – Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Ambassador Mills, DeLaurentis, Lu, Carty, and somewhere in here the heart and soul of USUN in Washington, Jeff Prescott.  To each and every one of you, as Linda said, thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>Virtually everything that we are doing, trying to do around the world to benefit the American people, our fellow citizens for the most part, comes together here in this mission.  Whether it’s dealing with COVID, whether it’s dealing with climate, whether it’s figuring out how we shape these emerging technologies, whether it’s grappling with a food security crisis that is taking hold of the world, exacerbated by Russia’s aggression in Ukraine – all of these things and so many more come together here at the United Nations.</p>
<p>And we know, and you know from what you’re doing every single day, that what we’re trying to accomplish for our country, for the American people, can’t effectively be done alone.  We need to be working with others.  We need to find cooperation; we need to find coordination; we need to do consultations.  And again, all of that is happening here.</p>
<p>And as Linda said, it is happening at extraordinary speed, an extraordinary pace.  I know that the – sometimes the worst words in the English language is “Washington’s coming to town.”  So I know how much has gone into just these couple of days and the extraordinary work that’s been packed into a couple of days, particularly the food security work that we’ve been doing yesterday and again today at the Security Council.  And I deeply appreciate all of the effort that’s gone into that.</p>
<p>Getting together with some 30 countries yesterday, also with African ministers, 10 countries, the Security Council meeting today, the migration forum on top of that – all of this made possible, by the way, by the remarkable protocol team, Matthew Miller – are you here, Matthew?  (Applause.)  Protocol is vital everywhere, but probably no more so than right here, and it’s multiplied by almost 200, so we’re really grateful for that.</p>
<p>So many of you also worked this spring to do what many people thought was impossible, which was, again, to help rally the world in opposition to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and in support of Ukraine.  UN resolutions at the General Assembly that got extraordinary support, 140, 141 countries – again, that doesn’t just happen.  It’s because of so much of the work that you’re doing, not just in the moment, but it’s also the product of the work you’re doing every day to build relationships, to build confidence, to build trust.  So again, I deeply appreciate that.</p>
<p>Let me say, too, that I know that even as we’re intensely focused on Ukraine, as I mentioned, there are so many other things going on that you’re taking on every single day.  I have a really hackneyed acronym that my colleagues in Washington are tired of hearing me talk about, but it is, nonetheless, important – ROW, R-O-W, rest of world.  Even if something very intense is going on, like Ukraine, we are, we have to be, focused on the rest of the world, and you’re doing that.  And for those of you who are working different portfolios that may not be in the spotlight at the moment, thank you for what you’re doing.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, even as we’ve been dealing with Ukraine, our diplomacy, including diplomacy that’s been centered here at the UN, has helped get a truce, for the time being at least, in Ethiopia.  And as result, humanitarian assistance is getting up into Tigray.  We helped get a truce in Yemen after eight years, and again, as a result, humanitarian assistance is flowing.  We have maybe a chance for a longer-lasting peace.  More than 500 million COVID vaccines have gotten through to other countries, free of charge, through COVAX, and – with no strings attached.  I could go down a list, but it shows that we are ROW, you are ROW.  You are making a difference every single day.</p>
<p>So I’m grateful to the work that you’re doing.  I really wanted to just come by and say thank you.  I also wanted to say, as Linda said, this the first gathering that you’ve had in this room in a while.  That is because, of course, we’ve all been living with COVID-19 for the last two years.  And I know the disruptive effect that it’s had not only on the way you’ve had to do your work, but for so many of you in your own personal lives.  And some people have been affected directly, and it makes everything that we all do more challenging.  And yet, you’ve come through that with tremendous professionalism and tremendous skill.</p>
<p>So to all of you here, I know being in New York you have the great benefit of being in the city, but I also want you to know you’re a crucial part of what we’re doing in Washington.  We couldn’t do our diplomacy, we couldn’t do our foreign policy, we couldn’t be as effective as we are being without the work that you’re doing.  So simply put, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>Ed Sullivan Theater</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Ladies and gentlemen, my guest tonight has worked in government for nearly 30 years and currently serves as our 71st Secretary of State.  Please welcome Secretary Antony Blinken.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>Thank you for being here.  I don’t take this lightly.  You don’t get a secretary of state on a late-night show every day.  (Cheers.)  Have you done many of these?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  This is the first one.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  This is the first one?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  It is.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  You’re going to love it.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>Now, I want to talk to you a little bit later about basically the State Department in general.  I think people misunderstand its mission often and how important it is.  But the first thing I want to talk to you about is that you’re the most informed person right now I could talk to about what’s going on in the war in Ukraine.  And – but before I ask you my questions, what would you like people to know about what the state of that conflict is right now?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Stephen, this is day 82 of what was an unprovoked, unjustified aggression by Russia against Ukraine.  And I think what the world already knows is we’ve seen the remarkable courage, resiliency of the Ukrainian people.  Overmatched – (cheers).</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Everyone said three or four days and it would be over.  Everyone thought it would be over in three or four days.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  There was a lot of expectation that that might happen.  But because of their courage, because of their resilience, but also because of the assistance that we’ve been able to provide them with dozens of other countries, they’ve not only held their ground, they’ve been pushing the Russians back.  They won the battle for Kyiv.</p>
<p>Now, there is an intense fight going on in eastern and southern Ukraine.  And the other thing is the country has been terribly brutalized by this Russian aggression.  We had that – the town of Bucha near Kyiv.  The Russians moved out.  When that tide receded, we saw what was left in its wake, and I’m afraid that as that happens in other parts of Ukraine, we’ll see it.</p>
<p>But the most important thing is this:  82 days in, the Ukrainians are standing up for their freedom.  They’re standing up for their sovereignty.  They have so much of the world with them.  And here’s what I can tell you:  What Vladimir Putin was trying to do was to take away their independence, their sovereignty.  In his mind, Ukraine is not an independent country; it needs to be subsumed into Russia.  That’s what this is about.</p>
<p>And what I think we can say with a lot of certainty and conviction is that a sovereign, independent Ukraine is going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene.  (Cheers.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Now, you were one of the first people to actually brief Zelenskyy before the war ever started about the likelihood of this invasion.  You were first to warn the public on behalf of the administration of what might be going over there.  You’re now leading the U.S. efforts to have a joint response from NATO countries and set the tone for the entire world.  All of that seems like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>One thing that worries me, however right I think the fight for the Ukrainians is, is that:  Is there a chance that this could tip over to a hot war with Russia?  Because certainly, Putin and all of his – the people in his circle have said they consider this a hot war with the West, whether or not we want to call it that.  So how do you make sure that that doesn’t happen?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Stephen, the President’s been very clear about this, about what this is and what it isn’t.  And what it isn’t is it isn’t a war with Russia.  This is the United States &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Not a proxy war.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  And it’s not a proxy war.  It’s about us giving the Ukrainians the help that they need to defend themselves, to stop the aggression, to hold onto their freedom, to hold onto their sovereignty.  That’s what we’re doing.  And we’re also putting pressure on Russia to try to get it to stop the aggression.  We have sanctions that we’ve been leading with dozens of other countries that are making life pretty difficult for the Russians.  More than 800 companies, big – the biggest brand names in the world – have left Russia because they don’t want the reputational cost of doing business there given this aggression.  That’s having a real impact.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Now, we see reports about the fall of Mariupol, and the Ukrainians fighters put up a fierce resistance there.  Now that that city – is that accurate, that Mariupol has fallen to the Russians?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The Russians have taken Mariupol.  It is &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What does that mean to the Russian efforts now?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The fight now is – after the Russians got pushed back from Kyiv and around Kyiv and from northern Ukraine and parts of western Ukraine, this has moved all the way east and all the way south, pretty near Russia itself.  And that’s what they’re – that’s what they’re fighting over.</p>
<p>And again, as I said, what’s so heartbreaking about this is when the world actually sees what’s happened in Mariupol, which it will one day, I’m afraid the pictures that we’ve seen coming out of Bucha a few – a couple months ago are going to be nothing by comparison.</p>
<p>So this is why I think people – and the American people have been incredibly generous, because – through Congress – so much support given to the Ukrainians, because I think it is touching people’s hearts.  They’re seeing a big country aggress a small one.  They’re seeing one country try to change the borders of another by force.  They’re seeing one country try to say to another country: we’re going to decide what your future’s going to be, not you.  And we can’t have a world that works that way.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And there’s a bipartisan response, which is &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  This has been remarkable.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Is unusual these days.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Anything that anyone can agree on.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  It’s been remarkable.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Part of Putin’s motivation for the war – as I see in the reporting that part of Putin’s motivation for the war is to weaken NATO.  Now, this was Monday and then Tuesday, Finland and then Sweden &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s right.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  &#8212; signed the applications.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s right.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Is Putin himself the greatest advertisement for NATO in a generation?  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  If I was going to have a poster for – well.  (Laughter.)  What’s remarkable is when you look at this, Stephen, President Putin has managed to precipitate everything he sought to prevent.  He wanted to prevent NATO from getting bigger with Ukraine.  Now it actually is with Finland and with Sweden.  He wanted to divide the West, divide the Alliance.  It’s more united than it’s ever been.  And as I said, he wanted to subjugate Ukraine, make it part of Russia.  That is not going to happen.  So everything we’re seeing is Putin achieving the exact opposite of what he says he wants.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Now, my buddy Pope Francis – (laughter) – has said that NATO takes some blame for this by basically stressing out Russia by expanding east up against Russia’s borders.  Do you think he’s got a case?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  So NATO &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I mean, he’s the Pope.  He’s the Pope.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  And I have great reverence for him.  I had the – now, he told me that you were very close when I saw him.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I have great reverence for him, but let me say this.  NATO is a defensive Alliance, countries coming together to make sure that if one of them was attacked all the others would come in and defend that country.  That’s what it’s about.  It has no aggressive intent against Russia.  It’s never attacked Russia; it won’t attack Russia.  It doesn’t intend to attack Russia.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I’ve got a crazy idea.  Invite Russia to be part of NATO.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Then what’s he got to be worried about?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  You know what?  Back in the 1990s that was actually something that people talked about.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>And?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b> Well, the Russians decided that wasn’t what they wanted to do.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Okay.  We have to take a quick break, but when we come back I will ask the Secretary about what Zelenskyy is like in person.  Stick around.</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hey, everybody.  We’re back here with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  You’ve met Zelenskyy.  After speaking to him many times, I assume, as Secretary of State, you went over there and visited with him over in Kyiv.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I did.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What’s he like?  He seems very impressive as a leader from a distance, but we know he was an actor and a comedian so he could just be acting impressive.  (Laughter.)  But what’s he like in person?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I’ve got to say, Stephen, he is – he is quite literally the embodiment of the courage of the Ukrainian people.  Because this is a guy who, when the bombs started coming in, the missiles started flying, he could have left town.  He could have gotten out of Kyiv.  He didn’t; he stayed.  He led his people.  And that’s both incredible personal courage, but it’s also because I think he felt that he had to represent Ukrainians, he had to stand up for the country’s freedom and independence.</p>
<p>So he’s really inspired people all around the world.  And I’ve had the occasion to meet him – meet with him half a dozen times.  Before the war, when we had this information that Russia was likely to do this, I had to tell him.  We were at the COP26, the climate meetings, and I sat with him and shared the information.  Telling someone that Russia may be about to invade your country is definitely an eye-opener, but he has proven to be remarkably resilient.</p>
<p>And of course, he’s also, I think, made a powerful fashion statement out of the green t-shirt.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>So when we visited – (applause).  When we visited, I went with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.  And if you’re going to go into a conflict zone with anyone, you want to go in with Lloyd Austin.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Because you can stand behind him.  He’s a huge man.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Yes, exactly.  He’s a big guy.  And we went and we had a remarkable three hours with President Zelenskyy, with his team.  We went in on this train that took about 12 hours to get from the Polish border into Kyiv.  And actually, Kyiv itself looks, now at least, remarkably normal – people on the streets going to coffee shops, et cetera.  Now, that doesn’t stop the Russians from still firing missiles that hit Kyiv, but the city has come back to life.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I understand that the embassy is going to reopen there.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The embassy – the flag went up today.  Embassy &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  The American flag.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  American flag.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What does that mean?  What’s the significance – well, two things.  What is the – and this will get us into what I want to talk to you about the State Department.  What is the significance of an embassy having to be evacuated and that moment of return?  What’s the significance of both those events?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  My first responsibility in this job as Secretary is to look out for the well-being of the men and women of the State Department.  I’ve got to have their security uppermost in mind.  So when the attack was coming, we had to make a really hard decision to suspend our operations and to get folks out of harm’s way.  Let me tell you this:  They didn’t want to go.  But we moved them to Poland.</p>
<p>They took the flag that was flying over the embassy that day with them, and that is the same flag that’s now flying over the embassy again in Kyiv today.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  We have to take a little break.  We’ll be right back with Secretary Antony Blinken, everybody.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hey, everybody.  We’re back here with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  We’re talking about a war, and we talked earlier about, like, the munitions that might go over and the tactical and intelligence help the United States may give.  But the State Department is not the Department of Defense; it’s not the Department of War.  Richard Holbrooke called it the department of peace.  And General Mattis said, “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.”</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s right.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What do people not understand about the mission of the State Department?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, you’ve got it exactly right.  Our job is to try to prevent war; if we fail at that, to try to make peace; and if we fail at that, to make sure that our diplomacy is doing everything it can wherever necessary not just to make life better for people around the world, but also to make life better for our own people, for the American people.  Because everything that we’re trying to do is to try to make the world just a little bit safer, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit healthier, a little bit wiser, a little bit more tolerant, and that’s going to benefit us.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What’s the state of the State Department right now?  We only have a minute here.  I’m just very curious.  It was sort of famously reported as being sort of denuded during the previous administration, that people who were leaving were not being replaced, that the halls were empty.  Is the State Department being restaffed?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, President Biden said early on, as we started to move around the world again, America’s back.  And I can tell you this:  The State Department’s back.  We have – our men and women throughout the world – (applause) – even as we’re relentlessly focused – relentlessly focused on Ukraine and on helping the Ukrainian people, we’re doing a lot of other things too.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten a truce in Ethiopia so that humanitarian assistance can get to people up in Tigray.  (Applause.)  We got a truce in Yemen after eight years of war so that there’s a chance at a lasting peace.  We’ve helped get now more than 500 million COVID vaccine shots to people around the world, on our way to 1.2 billion shots the United States is giving away free, no strings attached, so that we can get ahead of COVID around the world.  That’s the work we do every day.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing, Stephen.  What we know is this:  If the United States is not engaged, if we are not trying to lead, then one of two things.  Either someone else is – maybe it’s China, and that might not go forward in a way that reflects our interests and our values – or no one is, and that usually leaves a vacuum that’s filled by bad things before it’s filled by good things.  So that’s why it’s so important that we engage, that we lead, and we’re leading with diplomacy.  That’s what President Biden said he wanted.  That’s why the State Department is front and center.  That’s what we do.  We’re leading with diplomacy, we’re leading for America, and we’re trying to make things a little bit better around the world.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Well, thank you so much for being here.  As important as that work is that you just described, I think perhaps you’ll be – you’ll best be remembered as the lead guitarist for the band Ablinken.  (Laughter.)  And this is an actual photo.  We did not mock this up.  (Applause.)  Tell me about your band.  What do you get out of it and where are you guys gigging next?  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Stephen, I long wanted to be a musician.  As a kid, as a teenager, that’s what I wanted to do, and I see some real musicians over there.  (Laughter and applause.)  There was just one – one missing ingredient.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Yes.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Talent.  (Laughter.)  But it has been a constant thread in my life, so I’ve been in a bunch of “bands,” in quotation marks.  Coalition of the Willing.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Oh, sure, with András Simonyi, yeah, (inaudible), yes.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  With – yes, that’s right, among others.  Big Lunch.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Don’t know that one.  (Laughter.)  That’s on me.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Name because we kind of make you feel the way you do after you’ve had a big lunch.  (Laughter.)  A little bit drowsy.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Logy.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Exactly.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  A little logy.  Okay, sure.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  A little – exactly.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Logy dance band, yeah.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  And what we found – at least what I’ve found in my experience is that the best audience we have tends to be very young children who haven’t developed critical faculties.  (Laughter.)  That &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Well, just in case there are any of them watching right now, as we go out, would you care – do you guys have a guitar that the Secretary might be able to use?  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Secretary Blinken, thank you so much.  Antony Blinken, everybody.  We’ll be right back with a performance by Twice.  (Applause.)  Please, sir.  Won’t you, please.</p>

<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  And it’s not a proxy war.  It’s about us giving the Ukrainians the help that they need to defend themselves, to stop the aggression, to hold onto their freedom, to hold onto their sovereignty.  That’s what we’re doing.  And we’re also putting pressure on Russia to try to get it to stop the aggression.  We have sanctions that we’ve been leading with dozens of other countries that are making life pretty difficult for the Russians.  More than 800 companies, big – the biggest brand names in the world – have left Russia because they don’t want the reputational cost of doing business there given this aggression.  That’s having a real impact.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Now, we see reports about the fall of Mariupol, and the Ukrainians fighters put up a fierce resistance there.  Now that that city – is that accurate, that Mariupol has fallen to the Russians?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The Russians have taken Mariupol.  It is &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What does that mean to the Russian efforts now?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The fight now is – after the Russians got pushed back from Kyiv and around Kyiv and from northern Ukraine and parts of western Ukraine, this has moved all the way east and all the way south, pretty near Russia itself.  And that’s what they’re – that’s what they’re fighting over.</p>
<p>And again, as I said, what’s so heartbreaking about this is when the world actually sees what’s happened in Mariupol, which it will one day, I’m afraid the pictures that we’ve seen coming out of Bucha a few – a couple months ago are going to be nothing by comparison.</p>
<p>So this is why I think people – and the American people have been incredibly generous, because – through Congress – so much support given to the Ukrainians, because I think it is touching people’s hearts.  They’re seeing a big country aggress a small one.  They’re seeing one country try to change the borders of another by force.  They’re seeing one country try to say to another country: we’re going to decide what your future’s going to be, not you.  And we can’t have a world that works that way.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And there’s a bipartisan response, which is &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  This has been remarkable.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Is unusual these days.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Anything that anyone can agree on.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  It’s been remarkable.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Part of Putin’s motivation for the war – as I see in the reporting that part of Putin’s motivation for the war is to weaken NATO.  Now, this was Monday and then Tuesday, Finland and then Sweden &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s right.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  &#8212; signed the applications.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s right.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Is Putin himself the greatest advertisement for NATO in a generation?  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  If I was going to have a poster for – well.  (Laughter.)  What’s remarkable is when you look at this, Stephen, President Putin has managed to precipitate everything he sought to prevent.  He wanted to prevent NATO from getting bigger with Ukraine.  Now it actually is with Finland and with Sweden.  He wanted to divide the West, divide the Alliance.  It’s more united than it’s ever been.  And as I said, he wanted to subjugate Ukraine, make it part of Russia.  That is not going to happen.  So everything we’re seeing is Putin achieving the exact opposite of what he says he wants.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Now, my buddy Pope Francis – (laughter) – has said that NATO takes some blame for this by basically stressing out Russia by expanding east up against Russia’s borders.  Do you think he’s got a case?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  So NATO &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I mean, he’s the Pope.  He’s the Pope.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  And I have great reverence for him.  I had the – now, he told me that you were very close when I saw him.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I have great reverence for him, but let me say this.  NATO is a defensive Alliance, countries coming together to make sure that if one of them was attacked all the others would come in and defend that country.  That’s what it’s about.  It has no aggressive intent against Russia.  It’s never attacked Russia; it won’t attack Russia.  It doesn’t intend to attack Russia.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I’ve got a crazy idea.  Invite Russia to be part of NATO.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Then what’s he got to be worried about?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  You know what?  Back in the 1990s that was actually something that people talked about.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>And?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b> Well, the Russians decided that wasn’t what they wanted to do.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Okay.  We have to take a quick break, but when we come back I will ask the Secretary about what Zelenskyy is like in person.  Stick around.</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hey, everybody.  We’re back here with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  You’ve met Zelenskyy.  After speaking to him many times, I assume, as Secretary of State, you went over there and visited with him over in Kyiv.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I did.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What’s he like?  He seems very impressive as a leader from a distance, but we know he was an actor and a comedian so he could just be acting impressive.  (Laughter.)  But what’s he like in person?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I’ve got to say, Stephen, he is – he is quite literally the embodiment of the courage of the Ukrainian people.  Because this is a guy who, when the bombs started coming in, the missiles started flying, he could have left town.  He could have gotten out of Kyiv.  He didn’t; he stayed.  He led his people.  And that’s both incredible personal courage, but it’s also because I think he felt that he had to represent Ukrainians, he had to stand up for the country’s freedom and independence.</p>
<p>So he’s really inspired people all around the world.  And I’ve had the occasion to meet him – meet with him half a dozen times.  Before the war, when we had this information that Russia was likely to do this, I had to tell him.  We were at the COP26, the climate meetings, and I sat with him and shared the information.  Telling someone that Russia may be about to invade your country is definitely an eye-opener, but he has proven to be remarkably resilient.</p>
<p>And of course, he’s also, I think, made a powerful fashion statement out of the green t-shirt.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>So when we visited – (applause).  When we visited, I went with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.  And if you’re going to go into a conflict zone with anyone, you want to go in with Lloyd Austin.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Because you can stand behind him.  He’s a huge man.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Yes, exactly.  He’s a big guy.  And we went and we had a remarkable three hours with President Zelenskyy, with his team.  We went in on this train that took about 12 hours to get from the Polish border into Kyiv.  And actually, Kyiv itself looks, now at least, remarkably normal – people on the streets going to coffee shops, et cetera.  Now, that doesn’t stop the Russians from still firing missiles that hit Kyiv, but the city has come back to life.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I understand that the embassy is going to reopen there.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The embassy – the flag went up today.  Embassy &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  The American flag.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  American flag.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What does that mean?  What’s the significance – well, two things.  What is the – and this will get us into what I want to talk to you about the State Department.  What is the significance of an embassy having to be evacuated and that moment of return?  What’s the significance of both those events?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  My first responsibility in this job as Secretary is to look out for the well-being of the men and women of the State Department.  I’ve got to have their security uppermost in mind.  So when the attack was coming, we had to make a really hard decision to suspend our operations and to get folks out of harm’s way.  Let me tell you this:  They didn’t want to go.  But we moved them to Poland.</p>
<p>They took the flag that was flying over the embassy that day with them, and that is the same flag that’s now flying over the embassy again in Kyiv today.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  We have to take a little break.  We’ll be right back with Secretary Antony Blinken, everybody.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hey, everybody.  We’re back here with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  We’re talking about a war, and we talked earlier about, like, the munitions that might go over and the tactical and intelligence help the United States may give.  But the State Department is not the Department of Defense; it’s not the Department of War.  Richard Holbrooke called it the department of peace.  And General Mattis said, “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.”</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s right.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What do people not understand about the mission of the State Department?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, you’ve got it exactly right.  Our job is to try to prevent war; if we fail at that, to try to make peace; and if we fail at that, to make sure that our diplomacy is doing everything it can wherever necessary not just to make life better for people around the world, but also to make life better for our own people, for the American people.  Because everything that we’re trying to do is to try to make the world just a little bit safer, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit healthier, a little bit wiser, a little bit more tolerant, and that’s going to benefit us.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What’s the state of the State Department right now?  We only have a minute here.  I’m just very curious.  It was sort of famously reported as being sort of denuded during the previous administration, that people who were leaving were not being replaced, that the halls were empty.  Is the State Department being restaffed?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, President Biden said early on, as we started to move around the world again, America’s back.  And I can tell you this:  The State Department’s back.  We have – our men and women throughout the world – (applause) – even as we’re relentlessly focused – relentlessly focused on Ukraine and on helping the Ukrainian people, we’re doing a lot of other things too.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten a truce in Ethiopia so that humanitarian assistance can get to people up in Tigray.  (Applause.)  We got a truce in Yemen after eight years of war so that there’s a chance at a lasting peace.  We’ve helped get now more than 500 million COVID vaccine shots to people around the world, on our way to 1.2 billion shots the United States is giving away free, no strings attached, so that we can get ahead of COVID around the world.  That’s the work we do every day.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing, Stephen.  What we know is this:  If the United States is not engaged, if we are not trying to lead, then one of two things.  Either someone else is – maybe it’s China, and that might not go forward in a way that reflects our interests and our values – or no one is, and that usually leaves a vacuum that’s filled by bad things before it’s filled by good things.  So that’s why it’s so important that we engage, that we lead, and we’re leading with diplomacy.  That’s what President Biden said he wanted.  That’s why the State Department is front and center.  That’s what we do.  We’re leading with diplomacy, we’re leading for America, and we’re trying to make things a little bit better around the world.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Well, thank you so much for being here.  As important as that work is that you just described, I think perhaps you’ll be – you’ll best be remembered as the lead guitarist for the band Ablinken.  (Laughter.)  And this is an actual photo.  We did not mock this up.  (Applause.)  Tell me about your band.  What do you get out of it and where are you guys gigging next?  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Stephen, I long wanted to be a musician.  As a kid, as a teenager, that’s what I wanted to do, and I see some real musicians over there.  (Laughter and applause.)  There was just one – one missing ingredient.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Yes.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Talent.  (Laughter.)  But it has been a constant thread in my life, so I’ve been in a bunch of “bands,” in quotation marks.  Coalition of the Willing.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Oh, sure, with András Simonyi, yeah, (inaudible), yes.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  With – yes, that’s right, among others.  Big Lunch.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Don’t know that one.  (Laughter.)  That’s on me.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Name because we kind of make you feel the way you do after you’ve had a big lunch.  (Laughter.)  A little bit drowsy.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Logy.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Exactly.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  A little logy.  Okay, sure.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  A little – exactly.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Logy dance band, yeah.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  And what we found – at least what I’ve found in my experience is that the best audience we have tends to be very young children who haven’t developed critical faculties.  (Laughter.)  That &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Well, just in case there are any of them watching right now, as we go out, would you care – do you guys have a guitar that the Secretary might be able to use?  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Secretary Blinken, thank you so much.  Antony Blinken, everybody.  We’ll be right back with a performance by Twice.  (Applause.)  Please, sir.  Won’t you, please.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New York, New York</p>
<p>United Nations Headquarters</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  Welcome.  Thank you all so much for being here today.</p>
<p>We meet during what is the greatest global food security crisis of our time.  It’s a crisis that we all know has been building for years, driven in part by the pandemic, driven by an accelerating climate crisis.  Between 2016 and 2021, the number of people living in acute food insecurity, the level when a person’s inability to consume adequate food puts their lives or livelihoods in immediate danger, that has skyrocketed from 108 million people to 161 million people around the world.</p>
<p>It was this growing crisis that led Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield to make the nexus between food security and conflict the focus of a UN Security Council meeting that she chaired in March of last year.  And it’s why the United States made robust commitments at the secretary-general’s UN Food Systems Summit last September.</p>
<p>All of that – all of that was before the Russian Government’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which, according to the World Bank, may drive 40 million additional people worldwide into extreme poverty and food insecurity this year.  Indeed, every driver of the crisis that we’ll discuss today has been made worse by President Putin’s war of choice.</p>
<p>That’s why we thought it was so important to convene this high-level group to put a brighter spotlight on the devastating impact of this crisis and to marshal the global effort that is needed to address it.  This is something we’re intently focused on every day at the State Department and across the United States Government.  But it’s a crisis that demands a global response.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I’ll have the opportunity to lead a session in the Security Council on how conflicts like this one are fueling food insecurity and how rising food insecurity is threatening peace and security around the globe, problems that we have to tackle as parts of a whole.  Today, in our gathering, we want to focus on what we can do to save lives now and address the long-term drivers of this problem.</p>
<p>I’ll start by offering four suggestions, at least on the part of the United States, about what we can do.  But having said that, this meeting is really about hearing the perspectives of a range of colleagues and countries, both on how this crisis is affecting lives in your respective countries but also on what we can do together to address it.</p>
<p>First, from our perspective, we need countries to step up with substantial new contributions to fill the gaps faced by humanitarian organizations and agencies that are battling food insecurity which are forcing humanitarian groups to make incredibly wrenching decisions about when and where to cut lifesaving assistance.  The cost of doing business for vital organizations like the World Food Program, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNICEF, and others – the cost of doing business is going up.  We have to help them continue to do their business.</p>
<p>In particular, as well, countries with significant grain and fertilizer reserves as well as those with financial resources need to step up and do it fast.  The United States has announced more than $2.3 billion in new funding for emergency food assistance to meet global humanitarian needs since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Today, given the urgency of the crisis, we’re announcing another $215 million in new emergency food assistance.  And we’ll do much more.  We expect our Congress very soon to approve approximately $5.5 billion in additional funding for humanitarian assistance and food security.</p>
<p>Governments and international organizations can also come together to compel the Russian Federation to create corridors so that food and other vital supplies can safely leave Ukraine by land or by sea.  There are an estimated 22 million tons of grain sitting in silos in Ukraine right now, food that could immediately go toward helping those in need if it can simply get out of the country.</p>
<p>Second, we believe we must address the global fertilizer shortage.  Consider Africa, where the cost of fertilizer has already quadrupled since the start of the pandemic and has skyrocketed further since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  One way to address this is by creating incentives for countries to produce more fertilizer as the United States is doing by committing $500 million to boost U.S. production.  We can also help farmers maximize fertilizer efficiency learning from advances made by countries like Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Some have tried to blame the sanctions imposed on Russian – on the Russian Federation by the United States and many other countries for worsening this crisis.  This is false.  When we imposed sanctions on Russia in order to end the war as quickly as possible, we deliberately and carefully created exceptions for agricultural goods and fertilizer.  We’re working every day to get countries any information or assistance they need to ensure that sanctions are not preventing food or fertilizer from leaving Russia or anywhere else.</p>
<p>As with its decision to start this unjustified war, responsibility for the disruption of these supplies and the suffering that it’s causing around the world lies squarely and solely with the Russian Government.</p>
<p>Third, we believe we must increase investments in agricultural capacity and resilience.  That’s what the United States is doing through our Feed the Future program, which will invest $5 billion in more than 35 countries over five years, as well as our longstanding support of international agricultural research centers.  It’s also the focus of the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate<a title="" href="#1" name="m_-488744187024392686__ftnref1"></a>, which we launched a year ago with the United Arab Emirates to try to turbocharge investment in climate-smart agriculture.</p>
<p>Fourth, we believe that we have to help poor and vulnerable populations bear the colossal impact of this crisis.  International financial institutions have a critical role to play in doing this.  That’s why our Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen convened a session with the leadership of the international financial institutions just a few weeks ago and pushed for the development of the International Financial Institution Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity, which was released on the margins of today’s G7 financial ministerial.</p>
<p>Finally, if we want to save lives, we all have to be willing to shoulder added risk.  Last week, President Biden traveled to a family farm in Illinois.  He talked about how farms like the one he visited are working to double crop, harvesting two crops from the same field in the same year.  Now, this is something that doesn’t always work.  The growing seasons are short.  Weather doesn’t always cooperate.  But as the President said, that’s a risk we have to take.  So our government is working to provide additional insurance for American farmers who are willing to give it a try.</p>
<p>If we take these steps together – meeting the urgent need for food, fertilizer, and financing; investing more in the resilience of agriculture and vulnerable populations – we will meet this crisis, we’ll help prevent others like it, most important, we will save countless lives.  That’s what’s at stake, but I’m convinced that if we come together, we can address this challenge.</p>
<p>So thank you so much again for being here.  It’s now an honor and a privilege to give the floor to the secretary-general, who has been a leader in rallying the response to this crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary-General.</p>

<p>Third, we believe we must increase investments in agricultural capacity and resilience.  That’s what the United States is doing through our Feed the Future program, which will invest $5 billion in more than 35 countries over five years, as well as our longstanding support of international agricultural research centers.  It’s also the focus of the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate<a title="" href="#1" name="m_-488744187024392686__ftnref1"></a>, which we launched a year ago with the United Arab Emirates to try to turbocharge investment in climate-smart agriculture.</p>
<p>Fourth, we believe that we have to help poor and vulnerable populations bear the colossal impact of this crisis.  International financial institutions have a critical role to play in doing this.  That’s why our Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen convened a session with the leadership of the international financial institutions just a few weeks ago and pushed for the development of the International Financial Institution Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity, which was released on the margins of today’s G7 financial ministerial.</p>
<p>Finally, if we want to save lives, we all have to be willing to shoulder added risk.  Last week, President Biden traveled to a family farm in Illinois.  He talked about how farms like the one he visited are working to double crop, harvesting two crops from the same field in the same year.  Now, this is something that doesn’t always work.  The growing seasons are short.  Weather doesn’t always cooperate.  But as the President said, that’s a risk we have to take.  So our government is working to provide additional insurance for American farmers who are willing to give it a try.</p>
<p>If we take these steps together – meeting the urgent need for food, fertilizer, and financing; investing more in the resilience of agriculture and vulnerable populations – we will meet this crisis, we’ll help prevent others like it, most important, we will save countless lives.  That’s what’s at stake, but I’m convinced that if we come together, we can address this challenge.</p>
<p>So thank you so much again for being here.  It’s now an honor and a privilege to give the floor to the secretary-general, who has been a leader in rallying the response to this crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary-General.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New York, New York</p>
<p>United Nations Headquarters</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong> Hello.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Very good to be here with my friend, the Turkish prime minister<a title="" href="#1" name="_ftnref1" shape="rect"></a>.  Mevlüt and I were just together at the NATO Ministerial.  I’m looking forward to pursuing that conversation.  Today we had Finland and Sweden submit their applications, and this of course is a process, and we will work through that process as Allies and as partners.</p>
<p>We have a lot on our common agenda, including, of course, Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine.  The United States, Turkey, all of our allies have been resolute in support of Ukraine, and we want to see this Russian aggression come to an end.  I’m grateful for the solidarity that we’ve shown, that Turkey has shown in that effort.</p>
<p>There are many other challenges that we’re the dealing with together and maybe some opportunities, including the South Caucasus.  We’ll have an opportunity to talk about that.  And we want to talk about continuing to strengthen and build on our economic relationship and partnership.  Actually, we’ve reached record levels of trade here despite COVID, despite other challenges.  We want to build on that.</p>
<p>Finally, we’re both here because we feel acutely the challenge of food insecurity, a challenge that has been with us for some time.  Again, COVID, climate contributed, but also conflict, including, again, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.  So we’re going to spend some time both together and then with our colleagues talking about the steps that we can take in the near term to help alleviate food insecurity as well as some of the more medium-term and longer-term steps to build a stronger system.</p>
<p>With that, Mevlüt, good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER ÇAVUŞOĞLU:</strong>  Thank you.  Thank you, Tony.  Very good to see you, too, after our pull-aside in Berlin on the occasion of NATO informal ministerial.  And always a pleasure to discuss bilateral relations and regional and global issues with you directly.  Therefore, I’m very happy that we are going to convene the first Strategic Mechanism Ministerial today as well.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER ÇAVUŞOĞLU:</strong>  Of course, we will focus on our bilateral relationships, and we are aiming to overcome the differences through dialogue and diplomacy.  And there are areas that we need to also pay attention or focus to further deepen our bilateral relations and cooperation.</p>
<p>And you mentioned trade.  Yes, we aim to reach $100 million trade volume, and the increase in 2021 despite the pandemic actually made us more hopeful to reach that target.  And the developments and Russian aggression in Ukraine showed once again that as allies and friends, Turkey and the U.S. should have better cooperation.  This is the expectation of not only our nation, but also the friends and allies in our region and beyond.</p>
<p>And two new challenges that we are facing today – actually, ongoing one, the migration, and the food security.  And I’m very grateful to you to organize a session here in New York on food security, and also we will be addressing tomorrow at the global refugee review.</p>
<p>Yes, we see the threat in our region, and that’s the reason we see that Finland and Sweden want to be NATO member, new member.  You know, Tony, Turkey has been supporting the “Open Door” policy of NATO even before this war.  But with regards to these possible candidates – or already candidate countries – we have also legitimate security concerns that they had been supporting terrorist organizations.  And there are also export restrictions on defense products.</p>
<p>So we already express our concerns.  And I had a candid and direct talk with two colleagues, Ann and Pekka, in Berlin.  So what I am trying to say, we understand their security concerns, but Turkey’s security concerns should be also met.  And this is also one of – one issue that we should continue discussing with friends and allies, including United States.</p>
<p>So looking forward have a result-oriented and fruitful discussion today with you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks, Mevlüt.  (Inaudible.)</p>
