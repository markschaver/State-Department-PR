					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p class="p1">On the one-year anniversary of Belarus’s fraudulent presidential election, the United States government has taken decisive action against forty-four individuals and entities in order to hold <span class="s1">Alyaksandr</span> Lukashenka and his regime to account for its continued, violent repression of Belarusians inside and outside the country.  These steps are a further consequence to the Belarusian authorities’ continued flagrant disregard for human rights and Belarus’s failure to comply with its obligations under international human rights law.</p>
<p class="p2">Pursuant to a new Executive Order the President signed today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated forty-four individuals and entities. These sanctions are the latest in a series of efforts demonstrating our determination to take action in the face of the increased repression and sharply deteriorating human rights situation in Belarus.  <span class="s2">OFAC targeted, among others, entities and individuals, including state-owned enterprises, government officials, and others, who support the regime, facilitate its violent repression of the Belarusian people, and violate the rule of law.  </span></p>
<p class="p1">Democratic countries are stronger when they stand together. Alongside these U.S. actions, we welcome the steps taken today by the United Kingdom and Canada against the regime and those announced by the European Union on June 24. The United States further commends the ongoing close coordination with Lithuania and Poland as a demonstration of the steadfast international resolve in supporting the Belarusian people’s democratic aspirations.</p>
<p class="p2">One year ago, the people of Belarus turned out in record numbers to give voice to their democratic aspirations and desire for change.  Instead of honoring their votes, the regime fraudulently declared victory and embarked on a campaign of violence and repression.  Since that time, Lukashenka has sought to cement his hold on power at the expense of the Belarusian people.  Over 600 political prisoners are unjustly detained.  Independent media outlets have been raided and shuttered, and Belarusian authorities are attempting to silence NGOs and vital members of civil society.  Moreover, this repression does not occur solely within Belarus’s borders, as Belarusians abroad also face intimidation.  This repression features blatant disregard of international norms, as displayed by the brazen forced diversion of Ryanair flight 4978 for the purpose of arresting a Belarusian journalist, the dangerous attempt to intimidate the EU – in particular, our Ally Lithuania – by orchestrating irregular migrant flows on Belarus’s border, and most recently the attempted forced repatriation of Belarusian Olympian Krystsyna Tsimanouskaya, who has been offered a humanitarian visa by Poland.  These acts of transnational repression cannot be tolerated and must stop.  The United States stands in solidarity with our Allies and partners in responding to these threats.</p>
<p class="p1">The United States once again calls on the Belarusian authorities to end the crackdown on members of civil society, the media, athletes, students, legal professionals and other citizens, immediately release all political prisoners, engage in a genuine dialogue with the democratic opposition and civil society, as called for in the OSCE Expert Mission report, and hold free and fair elections under international observation.  We will continue working with the international community to hold to account those responsible for human rights violations and abuses in Belarus.</p>
<p class="p2">We stand with the people of Belarus in support of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p class="p1">The Department of State has concluded an administrative settlement with Keysight Technologies, Inc. (Keysight) of Santa Rosa, California, to resolve alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C. § 2751 <i>et seq</i>., and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. Parts 120-130.  The Department of State and Keysight have reached this settlement following an extensive compliance review by the Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance in the Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.</p>
<p class="p1">The Department of State and Keysight have reached an agreement pursuant to ITAR § 128.11 to address alleged <span class="s1">unauthorized exports of </span>technical data, and in this case, software used for testing radar equipment on fixed or mobile platforms.  The settlement demonstrates the Department’s role in strengthening U.S. industry by protecting technical data from unauthorized exports.  The settlement also highlights the importance of obtaining appropriate authorization from the Department for exporting software as well as determining proper export jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="p1">Under the terms of the 36-month Consent Agreement, Keysight will pay a civil penalty of $6,600,000.  The Department has agreed to suspend $2,500,000 of this amount on the condition that the funds will be used for Department-approved Consent Agreement remedial compliance measures.  Also, Keysight must hire an outside Special Compliance Officer for a term of two years and conduct an external audit to assess and improve its compliance program during the Consent Agreement term.</p>
<p class="p1">Keysight disclosed to the Department the alleged AECA and ITAR violations.  However, the Department first alerted Keysight of misclassification concerns and advised Keysight to obtain proper classification for the software through a Commodity Jurisdiction request, which led to the discovery of the violations.  Keysight cooperated with the Department’s review, including submitting one disclosure that acknowledged the charged conduct, implemented remedial compliance measures, and signed a statute of limitations agreement tolling the statutory period.  For these reasons, the Department has determined that it is not appropriate to administratively debar Keysight at this time.</p>
<p class="p1">The Consent Agreement and related documents will be available for public inspection in the <a href="https://foia.state.gov/Search/Search.aspx"><span class="s2">Public Reading Room of the Department of State</span></a> and on <a href="https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/ddtc_public?id=ddtc_kb_article_page&amp;sys_id=384b968adb3cd30044f9ff621f961941"><span class="s2">Penalties and Oversights Agreements</span></a> section of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls’ website.  For additional information, please contact the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs’ Office of Congressional and Public Affairs at <a href="mailto:pm-cpa@state.gov"><span class="s2">pm-cpa@state.gov</span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) newest report makes it clear – climate change is already a crisis.   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, the United States joined nearly 200 IPCC member governments in approving the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report.  This is the first volume in a series of four reports that the IPCC will release for the Sixth Assessment.  This report evaluates the physical science of climate change – looking at the past, present, and future climate and revealing how human-caused emissions are altering our planet and what that means for our collective future.   </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The report highlights that our climate is rapidly changing due to human influence and is already altering our planet in drastic ways <i>– </i>Arctic sea ice is at its lowest level in more than 150 years; sea levels are rising faster than at any time in at least the last 3,000 years; and glaciers are declining at a rate unprecedented in at least 2,000 years.  Weather and climate events – such as extreme heat, heavy rainfall, fire conditions, and droughts – are becoming more severe and frequent because of clima</span><span class="s2">te change.  We are seeing the detrimental impacts of these events on the lives and livelihoods of people around the world.     </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most importantly, the report finds we are already edging closer to a 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer world, and every day emissions rise the prospects for averting the worst impacts of climate change become dimmer.  This is why it is essential that all countries </span><span class="s3">–</span><span class="s1"> in particular the major economies </span><span class="s3">–</span><span class="s1"> do their part during this critical decade of the 2020s to put the world on a trajectory to keep a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on warming within reach.  This is why the United States has committed to a 50-52 percent reduction in emissions from 2005 levels in 2030 and is marshaling the entire federal government to tackle the climate crisis.  We cannot delay ambitious climate action any longer.   </span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As countries prepare for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, this report is a stark reminder that we must let science drive us to action.  This moment requires world leaders, the private sector, and individuals to act together with urgency and do everything it takes to protect our planet and our future in this decade and beyond.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Rosario Murillo&#8217;s decision on August 6 to ban the last genuine opposition party from participating in the November elections underscores their desire to remain in power at all costs.   This autocratic maneuver follows the detention of seven presidential candidates and 24 other opposition figures, human rights activists, business leaders, students, and NGO workers over the last two months.  The United States views the regime’s latest undemocratic, authoritarian actions—driven by Ortega’s fear of an electoral loss—as the final blow against Nicaragua’s prospects for a free and fair election later this year.  That electoral process, including its eventual results, has lost all credibility.</p>
<p>The Ortega-Murillo regime has undermined its  international commitments, including those under the Inter-American Democratic Charter, as well as the rights of the Nicaraguan people to freely choose their own leaders.  We will continue to work closely with other democracies to respond diplomatically and economically to these dire developments, which only further deprive the Nicaraguan people of their desire for a representative government and economic prosperity.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>I am announcing the designation of five terrorist leaders in Africa. Bonomade Machude Omar, Sidan ag Hitta, Salem ould Breihmatt, Ali Mohamed Rage, and Abdikadir Mohamed Abdikadir are designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) under Executive Order 13224, as amended.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bonomade Machude Omar, also known as Abu Sulayfa Muhammad and Ibn Omar, leads the Military and External Affairs Departments for ISIS-Mozambique and serves as the senior commander and lead coordinator for all attacks conducted by the group in northern Mozambique, as well as the lead facilitator and communications conduit for the group.  During the March 2021 attack on Palma, Omar led one group of fighters while Abu Yasir Hassan, the leader of ISIS-Mozambique, led another group of fighters, and Omar also led the attack on the Amarula Hotel in Palma.  Omar has been responsible for attacks in Cabo Delgado Province, Mozambique, and Mtwara Region, Tanzania.</li>
<li>Sidanag Hitta, also known as Abu Qarwaniand Abu Abdelhakim al-Kidali, is a senior leader and commander responsible for the Kidal Region in Mali within Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM). Hitta was among the group responsible for the January 20, 2019, attack on the MINUSMA base in Aguelhoc, Kidal Region, Mali.  He was also responsible for hostages in the Kidal Region.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States welcomes the appointment of Hans Grundberg as the new UN Special Envoy for Yemen. Grundberg brings considerable expertise on Yemen and the region, and we look forward to working closely with him to advance a durable resolution to the conflict in Yemen.</p>
<p>Now is the time for peace. Seven years of war and instability have devastated Yemen’s economy and eroded even the most basic services, leading to one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. There is unprecedented international and regional consensus on the need to end the Houthi offensive on Marib and other fighting, and on placing renewed emphasis on political talks to finally bring relief to the Yemeni people and allow them to determine a brighter future for their country.</p>
<p>The United States thanks former UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths for his efforts to resolve the conflict in Yemen. We look forward to continuing to work with Griffiths in his new position as the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government of the United States of America, I am honored to congratulate the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the ASEAN Secretariat on the 54th anniversary of the organization’s founding on August 8.</p>
<p>U.S.-ASEAN engagement is now in its fifth decade as it continues to foster a more stable, prosperous, and peaceful region. The strategic partnership between the United States and ASEAN contributes to our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, with ASEAN and ASEAN-led mechanisms as a centerpiece of regional architecture.</p>
<p>This week I had the privilege to participate in the U.S-ASEAN, East Asia Summit (EAS), ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), Mekong-U.S. Partnership, and Friends of the Mekong ministerial meetings. I value deeply the opportunity to interact with our friends at the ASEAN Secretariat, with the representatives from the nations that make up ASEAN, with other important regional stakeholders, and with partners and allies around the world interested in shaping a positive, peaceful and productive future for the ASEAN region.</p>
<p>At these meetings, and in this week’s U.S.-Indonesia Strategic Dialogue with Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, I reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to ASEAN and underscored the central role ASEAN has in our collective vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. To that end, we look forward to additional fruitful engagement in the region when Vice President Harris travels to Singapore and Vietnam this month to continue to discuss our cooperation on pressing regional and international challenges as well as on deepening ties between the people of the United States and the people of the nations of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>I also reaffirmed that the United States would continue to be partners with the countries of ASEAN in the fight against COVID-19. The United States has provided more than 23 million vaccine doses and over $158 million in health and humanitarian assistance to date to ASEAN members to support their response to the pandemic. We will also be there to support the region to build back better from the economic damage wrought by the pandemic by helping drive a green recovery and ensure readiness for future outbreaks. And we continue to be a champion for strong people-to-people ties between the combined one billion population between our countries, demonstrated through our ongoing support for the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) and other cultural, academic, and professional exchanges.</p>
<p>I congratulate ASEAN on its 54th anniversary and look forward to many more years of friendship and collaboration with the organization and the people of Southeast Asia.</p>
