<p>We send our best wishes for a joyous National Day.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The military operation authorized by President Biden and carried out by U.S. forces last night in northwest Syria has resulted in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, the leader of ISIS – a significant victory in the global fight to disrupt and dismantle ISIS.</p>
<p>This successful operation is a credit to our brave service members and national security professionals, who undertook this mission at President Biden’s direction after months of careful planning. Throughout that process, the United States took extraordinary care to protect innocent lives and prevent noncombatant casualties. ISIS, however, once again revealed its disregard for human life, including that of women and children, when al-Qurayshi choose to detonate a suicide bomb, killing his own family.</p>
<p>Al-Qurayshi, also known as Hajji Abdallah, took over ISIS in October 2019 after years of serving as a senior leader in the terrorist organization. He was known for his brutal enforcement of ISIS’s vicious ideology and was a driving force behind ISIS’s violent campaigns to subjugate communities and oppress perceived enemies, including the Yazidis, a religious minority in Iraq. He coordinated the group’s global terror operations during a period in which ISIS expanded its geographic presence and attacks in Africa.</p>
<p>This operation was part of a larger mission by the members of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS to deny ISIS’s territorial control in Iraq and Syria, counter ISIS’s messaging and financing, and stabilize areas that have been liberated from ISIS to prevent the group from resurging. Al-Qurayshi’s death strikes a significant blow against ISIS. Now the United States and our partners in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS will continue the effort. Our goal is the enduring defeat of ISIS and that fight continues.</p>

		<title>Designation of an Indonesia-Based Organization for Support to Terrorism</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is designating World Human Care, an Indonesia-based organization that has provided financial support to Majelis Mujahidin Indonesia (MMI), an Indonesia-based terrorist group.  World Human Care provides financial support for MMI activities in Syria under the pretense of providing humanitarian aid.  This sanctions action is taken under Executive Order 13224, as amended, which targets terrorists, leaders, and officials of terrorist groups, and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>MMI, formed in 2000, has conducted attacks in Indonesia.  It was designated by the Department of State on June 12, 2017, in connection with acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.  MMI has also been linked to the al-Qa’ida-linked Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham in Syria, another designated terrorist group.</p>
<p>The United States is taking this action to expose and disrupt MMI’s deceptive efforts to use a humanitarian organization as cover for raising and transferring illicit funds.  The vast majority of humanitarian aid providers are legitimate and often heroic organizations providing essential, life-saving humanitarian assistance in Syria and elsewhere.  Unfortunately, World Human Care’s actions are deplorable not only for their support for terrorist organizations but also because they undermine the work and reputation of genuine humanitarian aid providers worldwide.</p>
<p>We will continue to work with foreign partners to protect legitimate non-profit organizations from abuse by terrorist groups and expose terrorist financing under the guise of humanitarian aid. For more information on today’s action, please see the Department of the Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0585" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">We are concerned by the breach, announced last month, of sensitive data held by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  For 150 years, the ICRC and the wider Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement have played a unique and essential role in protecting vulnerable populations from the harms of armed conflicts, natural disasters, and other emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">To fulfill that role, the ICRC often does what no one else can — accessing detained persons in conflict zones or crossing frontlines to reach those in need.  Its independence and impartiality have long allowed it to have access to confidential information and data, including data on conflict victims and other victims of armed violence, the forcibly displaced, missing persons, and other vulnerable populations.  The information it acquires and uses is critical to fulfilling its functions to provide medical services and humanitarian protection and assistance — functions that all states have pledged to support in instruments such as the Geneva Conventions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">Targeting the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement’s sensitive and confidential data is a dangerous development.  It has real consequences: this cyber incident has harmed the global humanitarian network’s ability to locate missing people and reconnect families.  This is why it is so vital that humanitarian data be respected and only used for intended purposes.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: medium;">To ensure states and vulnerable people can continue to trust and rely on the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement for the help they need, states should join the ICRC in raising the alarm about this breach.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information on any person who, while acting at the direction of or under the control of a foreign government, interferes with U.S. elections by violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).</p>
<p>The Department seeks information on Iranian cyber actors Seyyed Mohammad Hosein Musa Kazemi and Sajjad Kashian – contractors employed by Iranian cyber company Emennet Pasargad – who participated in an Iranian state-sponsored, multi-phased online operation that attempted to interfere with the 2020 U.S. presidential election. This malicious cyber operation ran from at least August through November 2020 and sought to sow discord and undermine voters’ faith in the U.S. electoral process. In November 2021, these individuals and their employer, Emennet Pasargad, were designated under Executive Order 13848 for their role in attempting to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>Kazemi helped to carry out the voter intimidation and influence campaign by compromising servers, which were used to send the threatening voter emails, preparing emails for the voter threat email campaign, and compromising the email accounts of an American media company.</p>
<p>Kashian managed computer network infrastructure used to conduct the voter intimidation and influence campaign and sought to purchase social media accounts in furtherance of the voter intimidation and influence campaign.</p>
<p>Both individuals face sanctions and federal criminal charges in connection with their activities.</p>
<p>More information about this reward offer is located on the Rewards for Justice website at <a href="https://rewardsforjustice.net/terrorist-rewards/foreign-interference-in-us-elections/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener">https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/election_interference.html </a>. We encourage anyone with information on Kashian and Kazemi to contact the Rewards for Justice office via our Tor-based tips-reporting channel at: he5dybnt7sr6cm32xt77pazmtm65fl<wbr />qy6irivtflruqfc5ep7eiodiad.<wbr />onion (Tor browser required).</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1984, the program has paid in excess of $200 million to more than 100 people across the globe who provided actionable information that helped prevent terrorism, bring terrorist leaders to justice, and resolve threats to U.S. national security. Follow us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener">https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA </a><wbr />.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of State is announcing a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the conviction of Maximiliano Dávila Perez, a Bolivian national.  Dávila is the former Director of the Bolivian Special Forces for the Fight Against Drug Trafficking (Fuerza Especial de Lucha Contra el Narcotráfico, or FELCN).  During his time as FELCN Director, Dávila is believed to have used his position to safeguard aircraft used to transport cocaine through third countries for distribution in the United States.  Moreover, both prior to and during his time as FELCN Director, Dávila was allegedly involved in narcotics trafficking and money laundering.</p>
<p>On September 22, 2020, Dávila and associates were indicted by a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York.  The indictment charges Dávila with conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and conspiring to use or carry machine guns during and in relation to, and to possess machine guns in furtherance of, the drug trafficking conspiracy.</p>
<p>This reward is offered under the Department of State’s Narcotics Rewards Program (NRP), which the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) manages in close coordination with U.S. federal law enforcement partners and other U.S. government agencies.  More than 75 transnational criminals and major narcotics traffickers have been brought to justice with the help of the NRP and the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program (TOCRP) since 1986, with the Department paying more than $135 million in rewards to date.</p>
