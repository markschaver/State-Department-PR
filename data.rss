					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Ann Linde, Swedish Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good morning, everyone.  It’s a great pleasure to have my colleague and friend Foreign Minister Linde here in Washington at the State Department, pursuing a conversation on work we’ve been doing for so many months.  But Ann, welcome, and let me say this is a particularly important time for the longstanding and strong and vital partnership between the United States and Sweden.  We are working together across so many different issues that have an impact on the lives of our people, starting with Euro-Atlantic security, but going through everything from standing together strongly for democracy, for human rights, for humanitarian assistance, not only in Europe but around the world.</p>
<p>I’m grateful to Ann and to Sweden for its leadership last year of the OSCE, but now as well for its strong partnership and particularly its support of Ukraine and in opposition to the Russian aggression against Ukraine.  We both believe strongly that we need to and we are standing up for the people of Ukraine, but also standing together and standing up for the principles of the international order that are also being aggressed by Russia in Ukraine.</p>
<p>So we in the United States are grateful for this partnership, grateful for the work that we’re doing together.  And I look forward to pursuing our conversations on all of these things in a few minutes.  Welcome.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LINDE:</b>  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary, dear Tony.  I am so happy that we have managed to meet several times already, because now when we are in such difficult times it’s easier to continue our already very good relationship.  It is actually a horrendous time with Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has made all of us to consider what is the most secure situation for our countries and our peoples.  This is something we will discuss.</p>
<p>I also thank you for your leadership when it comes to sanctions against Russia because of the invasion of Ukraine, and that we have been able to keep so close, from Sweden, from EU, together with U.S.  Transatlantic link has maybe never been so important as it is now.</p>
<p>And we also cooperate on other issues, I have to say, like Yemen, which both Sweden and the United States are so engaged with, and both on our level but also on our special envoys level we cooperate a lot.  And that is because we have many of the same values: for people to thrive, people to be able to keep their own way in their own countries, and this is something we continue.</p>
<p>So I’m looking forward to our discussions today.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.  Again, welcome.  Thanks, everyone.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LINDE:</b>  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Director General is pleased to announce that two individual State Department employees and a team of three additional State Department employees are named as finalists to receive the 2022 Service to America Medals, a national awards program to honor the achievements of federal employees.</p>
<p>Scott Busby, the Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Affairs, is one of the five national finalists for the Paul A. Volcker Career Achievement Medal.  This medal recognizes a federal employee for leading significant and sustained accomplishments throughout a federal career of 20 or more years.</p>
<p>Acting PDAS Busby has designed and overseen landmark efforts to advance human rights overseas and hold violators accountable.</p>
<p>Samantha Sutton, an advisor at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations currently detailed as the chief of staff to the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, is one of five finalists for the Emerging Leaders Medal. This medal recognizes young federal employees under the age of 35, who have made an important contribution early in their professional career.</p>
<p>Ms. Sutton has played an important behind-the-scenes role across three presidential administrations as an adviser on U.S. policy toward Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Hilary Ingraham, Refugee Processing Center Director;  Holly Herrera, Domestic Resettlement Section Chief; Kiera Berdinner, Program Officer; and the Operation Allies Welcome Resettlement Team of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) represent one of five finalists for the Safety, Security, and International Affairs Medal. This medal recognizes a federal employee or team for a significant accomplishment in fields such as counterterrorism, civil rights, defense and military affairs, diplomacy, foreign assistance, trade, consumer protection, cybersecurity and emergency preparedness and response.</p>
<p>The PRM team has coordinated the largest resettlement of refugees in modern U.S. history, providing housing and services in record time to more than 72,000 Afghans who fled from Afghanistan in 2021 as American forces withdrew from the war-torn country.</p>
<p>The Service to America Medal award was created in 2002 by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization committed to recruiting and retaining excellence in the federal civilian service.
