					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Good morning, everyone, and thanks very much for joining us today as we are previewing the forthcoming release of the State Department 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report.  Just as a reminder, this call is on background.  You can attribute what you hear to a senior State Department official.  It’s also embargoed.  The embargo will be lifted upon the start of the formal event we are convening later today with Secretary Blinken.  We expect that event will start around 1 p.m. and the embargo will lift as soon as that event starts.</p>
<p>So just for the purposes of your background information, today’s speaker will be .  But again, she should be referred to as a senior State Department official for the purposes of your reporting.  And again, this call is embargoed until around 1 p.m. when we expect Secretary Blinken will start the formal event.</p>
<p>So with that, I will turn it over to our senior State Department official, and we’ll take your questions from there.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thank you, , and good morning.  Thank you all for joining this briefing and for your interest in the Trafficking in Persons Report.  I’ll begin just by sharing a little background information and some context on the report itself.</p>
<p>So the Trafficking in Persons Report, also known as the TIP Report, is the U.S. Government’s principal diplomatic and diagnostic tool to guide relations with foreign governments on human trafficking.  It is also the world’s most comprehensive resource on governmental anti-trafficking efforts, and it reflects the U.S. Government’s commitment to global leadership on this key human rights, law enforcement, and national security issue.</p>
<p>This year’s report, which is the 21st installment, includes narratives for 188 countries and territories, including the United States.</p>
<p>A country’s tier ranking reflects the State Department’s assessment of that government’s efforts during the reporting period to meet the Trafficking Victim Protection Act minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons.  The department strives to make the report as accurate and objective as possible, documenting the successes and shortcomings of government anti-trafficking efforts, and it does not make assessments based on political considerations.</p>
<p>The TIP Report assesses a country’s efforts against those TVPA minimum standards and against its own efforts during the previous reporting period; it does not compare countries.  It also takes into account a country’s resources and capacity when weighing factors.</p>
<p>And just to clarify, the reporting period is from April 1, 2020 through March 31st of 2021 for this year’s report.</p>
<p>All governments should strive to continually improve their efforts across what are referred to as the 3Ps of the anti-trafficking framework – of prosecution, protection, and prevention.  In fact, the TVPA requires governments to demonstrate continual progress, especially to retain rankings on Tier 1 or Tier 2.</p>
<p>Tier 2 Watch List rankings are time-limited by U.S. law, as governments can only retain this ranking for a maximum of three consecutive years; thus, here too ongoing efforts to improve are critical.  For Tier 3 governments – those that are assessed as failing to make significant efforts to meet the minimum standards and do not, in fact, meet the minimum standards – also Tier 3 countries include countries whose governments have a policy or pattern of trafficking.  For those countries on Tier 3, restrictions on assistance may apply.</p>
<p>The TIP Report introduction focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trafficking trends and anti-trafficking efforts around the world.  It outlines how the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated trafficking situations and significantly increased the number of people worldwide at risk to exploitation, as well as how traffickers adapted their methods to take advantage of these circumstances.</p>
<p>The introduction also illustrates the innovative ways that many have adapted their anti-trafficking efforts.  It emphasizes lessons learned from practitioners, offers ways to rebuild strong anti-trafficking strategies, and focuses on ways governments can prevent the compounding effects of crises on trafficking victims and vulnerable individuals.</p>
<p>We saw, for example, that the governments of countries such as Paraguay identified significantly more trafficking victims through routine screening at pandemic quarantine facilities, or in Turkey, where the government trained shelter staff on pandemic mitigation efforts and provided COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment to victims staying at those shelters.  Mexico secured its first trafficking in persons conviction from a virtual court session in June 2020, just weeks after resuming legal proceedings following a two-month shutdown related to the pandemic.  Lebanon and the Czech Republic extended the ability of migrants to stay in those countries for their safety related to the pandemic and also adjusted the limits of their respective visa regimes – all to help ensure the victims were protected during the pandemic.  These are just a few of many examples that the report outlines.</p>
<p>The introduction to this year’s report also seeks to elevate other important themes, such as the struggle to realize racial equity, the importance of survivor leadership, the harmful effects of conspiracy theories related to trafficking, and the reality of familial trafficking.</p>
<p>We also included a box in the introduction this year on state-sponsored trafficking in persons and, due to the scale of the problem, one specifically on forced labor in China’s Xinjiang region and beyond.</p>
<p>I would also like to share some noteworthy results and tier movement within this year’s report.  Overall, there are approximately the same number of downgrades and upgrades as in prior years.</p>
<p>On a positive note, there were several upgrades due to tangible progress that governments made to combat trafficking around the world despite the pandemic.  We saw progress even in countries where the trafficking challenges have been intractable over many years.</p>
<p>Several governments received upgrades to Tier 2 for increasing efforts to address trafficking, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Dominican Republic, Jordan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Not all countries made such progress.  Six countries received downgrades from Tier 1 to Tier 2 as the department assessed that the governments of the Republic of Cyprus, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, and Switzerland did not meet all four of the minimum standards and were therefore not making “appreciable progress” compared to the previous year and no longer met the minimum standards to stay on Tier 1.</p>
<p>Twelve countries were also downgraded from Tier 2 to Tier 2 Watchlist.  I won’t list the full number, but I’ll note a couple that may attract your attention include South Africa and Thailand.</p>
<p>There were also two countries that were downgraded this year from the Watch List to Tier 3.  Those two countries are Guinea-Bissau and Malaysia.</p>
<p>There is also an important provision in the TVPA, the Trafficking Victim Protection Act, that requires the department to make a determination whether countries have a policy or pattern of the government engaged in trafficking.</p>
<p>This year, the department made that determination that 11 countries continued to have a government policy or pattern of trafficking and inadequate enforcement mechanisms; some government officials in these countries were themselves part of the problem, directly compelling citizens or foreign nationals into sex trafficking, forced labor, or use as child soldiers.</p>
<p>We found that officials used their power to exploit their citizens or foreign nationals ranging from forced labor in local or national public works projects, military operations, economically important sectors, or as part of government-funded projects or missions abroad, to sexual slavery on government compounds.</p>
<p>I’m happy to share the list of 11 countries, but in the interest of time I’ll probably not read the full list now.  But I will note a couple of particular interest.  China remained on Tier 3 and is again noted for having a government policy of forced labor, particularly in Xinjiang detention in camps that is intended to erase ethnic and religious identities under the pretext of “vocational training,” and forced labor is a central tactic used for this repression.</p>
<p>Also, the Cuban Government increased the number and size of overseas medical missions.  Dozens of country reports include information regarding the program’s lack of transparency, unaddressed labor violations, and forced labor.</p>
<p>Finally, just two more points I wanted to raise at the beginning.</p>
<p>This year, 15 countries are included on the 2021 Child Soldier Prevention Act List for having governmental armed groups or supporting nongovernmental armed groups that recruit or use children in armed conflict.</p>
<p>And finally, the department is recognizing eight TIP Report heroes who have devoted their lives to the fight against human trafficking.</p>
<p>The 2021 heroes come from Albania, the Central African Republic, Gabon, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Qatar, and Spain.  These individuals inspire each of us to do more to advance the global fight against human trafficking and protect the victims and survivors of this crime.  The ceremony today that Secretary Blinken will host will highlight and celebrate the accomplishments of these extraordinary individuals.</p>
<p>And with that, thank you very much.  I’ll be happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Great, thank you very much.  Operator, if you want to repeat the instructions for asking questions.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your telephone keypad.  Please ensure your line is open before starting your question.  Once again, please press 1 then 0 on your telephone keypad.  One moment, please.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Okay, let’s start with the line of Missy Ryan, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks.  And thanks very much for this briefing.  I just had a question about Afghanistan, and I see that – so if I understood correctly, it’s on Tier 3 for the – is it – am I correct to say second year?  And so I’m wondering what the impact, if any, is on American assistance to Afghanistan currently or in the future, and what the situation is around that.  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yes, thank you so much for that question.  Afghanistan did again demonstrate a government policy or pattern of human trafficking and will therefore again appear on Tier 3.  As you noted, Tier 3 countries may carry restrictions for non-humanitarian and non-trade-related assistance.  The president may waive those restrictions, as he did for Afghanistan when it was placed on Tier 3 in the 2020 TIP Report.  Those restrictions go into effect for the next fiscal year, so he waived the restrictions for this fiscal year that went into – that began in October.  This summer, there will be a process of preparing recommendations to inform the President’s decisions for the countries that appear on Tier 3 in the 2021 TIP Report, and we expect that the President will make those decisions before the beginning of the next fiscal year in October.</p>
<p>And you are right, this is the second year that Afghanistan is on Tier 3 for a government policy or pattern of human trafficking.  Specifically, the report notes in the area of the use and recruitment of child soldiers as well as a widespread practice of bacha bazi, which is essentially sexual slavery on government compounds.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  We’ll go to the line of Matt Lee.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Matt, I think – yeah, I think your line’s open.  Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah.  All right.  I assume you can hear me, so I’m just going to go ahead and do it.  I’m sorry, these are kind of logistical questions.  Could you just repeat the list of six countries downgraded from Tier 1 to Tier 2?  And also, were there any countries that moved from Tier 3 up?  And then the last one is:  For Guinea-Bissau and Malaysia, are those – those were demoted because of the statutory time that they could be exempted or put into the Watch List, or was there demonstrable regression in their approach?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yeah, thank you for all those questions.  I hope I got them all.  If I missed any, feel – please feel free to repeat them.</p>
<p>The six countries that were downgraded from Tier 1 to Tier 2 include Cyprus, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, and Switzerland.  There were four countries upgraded from Tier 3 this year.  They include Belarus, Burundi, Lesotho, and Papua New Guinea.  And the two countries that were downgraded to Tier 3, Guinea-Bissau and Malaysia, were in fact both out of time on the Watch List.  They had exceeded their time.  They had been on the Watch List for three years, and therefore were no longer able legally to stay on the Watch List and did not make enough progress to support an upgrade to Tier 2, and therefore were automatically downgraded to Tier 3.</p>
<p>Did I get all your questions?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Sounded like you did.  Let’s go on to the line of Lara Jakes, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, good morning.  Is my line open?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Great, thanks.  In terms of the pandemic’s impact on human trafficking, can you give us a little more sense of what kind of trends you saw that were more prevalent or more alarming than in years past that were directly caused by the pandemic?  I was looking in the – kind of the executive summary.  I see that there was a trend of the – perhaps the pandemic had spurred more migration and made people more vulnerable to trafficking.  I also saw a large section on stay-at-home sex trafficking victims.</p>
<p>And I’m just wondering, which – not that this is a zero-sum game, but which one of these trends seemed to grow at a more alarming rate directly caused by the pandemic?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thank you for those important questions.  We have spent a lot of time this year gathering information and carefully analyzing the effects of the pandemic on trafficking trends, on trafficking victims and survivors, as well as government and service providers’ response to trafficking.</p>
<p>Overall, the concurrence of the increased number of individuals at risk due to the pandemic, traffickers’ ability to capitalize on competing crises, and the diversion of resources to pandemic response efforts has resulted, in many ways, in an ideal environment for human trafficking to flourish and evolve.</p>
<p>Despite these added challenges and risks that the pandemic presented, we have also witnessed the adaptability among those continuing to fight human trafficking and their dedication to ensuring the continuation of anti-trafficking efforts and minimize the effects of the pandemic on victims and the broader anti-trafficking community.</p>
<p>To your question about some of the specific effects, we did see that during the pandemic, anti-trafficking stakeholders experienced a number of conditions that made work to combat trafficking in persons exceptionally difficult.  Governments faced reduced capacities as priorities shifted to focus on growing health and economic concerns.  Victims and survivors faced heightened risk of re-victimization and obstacles accessing assistance and support as lockdowns, social distancing protocols, and a lack of resources caused survivor service providers to close shelters and reduce services.</p>
<p>Technology, as you noted, was widely utilized both to safely continue to combat trafficking such as to – you noted the negatives.  I’ll note the positives first and then the negatives.  Technology was also used to resume prosecution efforts and investigation efforts and to prevent further court backlogs through virtual investigative and court proceedings.</p>
<p>We did, unfortunately, also see that the increased use of technology created more vulnerability that traffickers unfortunately also exploited, as you noted, through online sex trafficking.  Also traffickers used the internet and other remote connectivity options to recruit trafficking victims, often with fraudulent job offers, so we did see, unfortunately, that that was a trend.  Thankfully, we saw the governments, service providers, NGOs, and many survivors themselves were resilient and adapted to the evolving situation as well.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Go the line of Humeyra Pamuk.  Humeyra Pamuk.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I’m assuming everyone can hear me, so I’ll just go ahead.  I just want to ask – I see that Turkey has moved to the list of countries who are implicated in the use of child soldiers.  I just want to confirm if this is the first time a NATO member is on this list, and I just want to also ask a little bit about methodology.  There have been reports that the – some of the Syrian factions that Turkey has supported have been involved in various human rights abuses, use of child soldiers.  The fact that the country made it to this list this year, does that mean the United States has now independently verified these reports?</p>
<p>And my final question is:  How does this impact any military cooperation with Turkey?  I’m well aware that there is a specific distinction in attribution to the armed groups that it supports and not the country’s armed forces, but still, U.S. is in the middle of negotiating a really important deal for Turkey to run the Kabul airport, and I’m looking at the report and it says – it talks about a number of restrictions on security assistance and a few other things, and Turkey is seeking financial and various military support to run the Kabul airport from United States.  Would that have any impact on it if that’s the case?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yeah, thank you very much for that important question.  The United States places considerable attention on the issue of the unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers.  The United States condemns the practice of unlawfully recruiting or using child soldiers and work to end this practice, which is considered a form of human trafficking in certain circumstances, and we work to do so wherever it occurs.  Through this abhorrent practice, governments and government-supported armed groups rob innocent children of their childhoods and may cause them to commit terrible violence, in some cases against their own loved ones.</p>
<p>Across the globe, wherever we see this occurring, we raise this issue through both military and civilian channels, and we work with concerned citizens, the United Nations, and nongovernmental organizations.  Our aim is to monitor, report on, and prevent the unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers, as well as to protect, assist, and rehabilitate these children, including by working with civil society and governments of countries where governments or government-supported armed groups unlawfully recruit or use child soldiers.</p>
<p>And I want to pause on that last sentence just to note that that is the legal standard, that the Child Soldier Prevention Act requires the State Department to list countries on this list where either governments or government-supported armed groups are unlawfully recruiting or using child soldiers.  And through this list, the United States puts on notice those countries where we do have credible information of the recruitment or use of child soldiers.  We take these allegations very seriously.  We conduct in-depth research on all relevant information and engage directly with governments year-round regarding these concerns.</p>
<p>With respect to Turkey in particular, you are correct that this is the first time a NATO member has been listed on the Child Soldier Prevention Act list.  As a respected regional leader and member of NATO, Turkey has the opportunity to address this issue, the recruitment and use of child soldiers in Syria and Libya.  We did determine and document in this report that the Government of Turkey provided support to the Sultan Murad Division, a non-state armed group that recruited and used child soldiers.  This division is a Syrian armed opposition group that operates under the umbrella of the Turkish-supported Syrian National Army.  The Government of Turkey provided tangible support to the Sultan Murad Division which included transit through Turkish territory during the reporting period of – as I said before, that reporting period is April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021.  The United States hopes to work with Turkey to encourage all groups involved in the Syrian and Libyan conflicts not to use child soldiers, and we hope to work with Turkey to address this issue in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Michel Ghandour.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes.  What does the Tier 3 list include other than China, Cuba, and Afghanistan?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  There – it’s a fairly long list.  There are 15 countries, I think, on the list.  I’m happy to read you the list of countries that are on Tier 3 in alphabetical order.  They include Afghanistan, as we already discussed; Algeria, Burma, China, Comoros, Cuba, Eritrea, Guinea Bissau, Iran, North Korea, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Russia, South Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.  Sorry, it’s 17; I counted wrong.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We&#8217;ll take a couple final questions.  Let’s go to Jiha Ham, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, I hope you can hear me.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We can.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you for doing this.  Thank you for taking my question.  I have a question on North Korea.  So the report on North Korea, it says the Chinese Government often sends North Korea defectors back to North Korea forcibly.  But according to the report, because of the COVID, North Korean authorities in 2020 refused to accept more than 200 defectors.  I&#8217;m sure they are still in China, because the border is still closed between the two countries.  So my question is:  Were there any efforts that the U.S. Government tried to intervene the situation or directly at China not to send these defectors back to North Korea?  If not, what will be your message to China?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yeah, thank you for that question.  We have long noted concerns in the TIP Report in both the China and the North Korea narrative for many years, our concerns about defectors or other North Korean nationals being returned to North Korea and the risk that they face to forced labor, other forms of trafficking, and other human rights abuses, if they are returned.  We have included a recommendation in the China narrative for many years and have raised this issue with the Chinese Government.  We encourage them not to return people back to North Korea, particularly without screening for human trafficking, since we know this is a population that’s particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.  Obviously, we have much broader human rights concerns in North Korea, and this is one of many issues that we raise with the Chinese Government.  And we publicly note our concerns about North Korea.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We’ll go to the line of Mouhamed Elahmed.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, .  Thank you for doing this.  I have couple of questions, please.  I was skimming over the report, and it seems that the Syrian refugees, especially women and children, have been trafficked, used, and exploited in so many countries in the Middle East, like Egypt for example.  So how does this represent the challenge to the U.S. efforts to address this issue in the Middle East?  Are there any programs that the USAID, for example, is planning to provide to help those victims to rehabilitate?</p>
<p>And finally, do you think that by solving the refugee crisis in Syria or even in Yemen, would that help in reduce or eliminate the trafficking persons in the Middle East that has been increased in the recent years?  Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yeah, thank you for that question.  You are right that – to point out that Syrian refugees are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking and all kinds of other hostilities throughout the region.  We have long documented those concerns and trafficking abuses that occur, that traffickers target Syrian refugees, as they do many other refugees and migrants, both in the Middle East region and more broadly in the world.  They comprise a group of people that traffickers recognize often do not have a safety net around them. They may not have family relatives; they may not have a lot of other options to seek help and support.  And therefore, traffickers often prey and target specifically refugees and migrants.  And sadly, that is very true for Syrian refugees and migrants in the region as well.</p>
<p>We have included recommendations for many years for countries in the region, both the Middle East and I would also say European countries that have also hosted or through which Syrian migrants and refugees have traveled, and urge those governments to screen for trafficking indicators and identify proactively trafficking victims among this group so that they can get them the care that they need, that is tailored for trafficking victims to prevent their future exploitation and potential re-trafficking as well.  We’ve also used some of our foreign assistance funds specifically to raise awareness and build governments’ capacity in the region to identify and provide care for those trafficking victims among this group.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Well, we will leave it there.  I want to thank our speaker.  Again, this call was on background.  You can refer to our speaker as a senior State Department official, and the call is embargoed until approximately one o&#8217;clock today, when the event with Secretary Blinken begins.  We will have additional opportunities for you to hear from the Secretary and from senior State Department officials today, including at the press briefing on the rollout of the 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report.  Thanks, everyone, for joining, and we’ll talk to you later today.</p>

<p>There is also an important provision in the TVPA, the Trafficking Victim Protection Act, that requires the department to make a determination whether countries have a policy or pattern of the government engaged in trafficking.</p>
<p>This year, the department made that determination that 11 countries continued to have a government policy or pattern of trafficking and inadequate enforcement mechanisms; some government officials in these countries were themselves part of the problem, directly compelling citizens or foreign nationals into sex trafficking, forced labor, or use as child soldiers.</p>
<p>We found that officials used their power to exploit their citizens or foreign nationals ranging from forced labor in local or national public works projects, military operations, economically important sectors, or as part of government-funded projects or missions abroad, to sexual slavery on government compounds.</p>
<p>I’m happy to share the list of 11 countries, but in the interest of time I’ll probably not read the full list now.  But I will note a couple of particular interest.  China remained on Tier 3 and is again noted for having a government policy of forced labor, particularly in Xinjiang detention in camps that is intended to erase ethnic and religious identities under the pretext of “vocational training,” and forced labor is a central tactic used for this repression.</p>
<p>Also, the Cuban Government increased the number and size of overseas medical missions.  Dozens of country reports include information regarding the program’s lack of transparency, unaddressed labor violations, and forced labor.</p>
<p>Finally, just two more points I wanted to raise at the beginning.</p>
<p>This year, 15 countries are included on the 2021 Child Soldier Prevention Act List for having governmental armed groups or supporting nongovernmental armed groups that recruit or use children in armed conflict.</p>
<p>And finally, the department is recognizing eight TIP Report heroes who have devoted their lives to the fight against human trafficking.</p>
<p>The 2021 heroes come from Albania, the Central African Republic, Gabon, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Qatar, and Spain.  These individuals inspire each of us to do more to advance the global fight against human trafficking and protect the victims and survivors of this crime.  The ceremony today that Secretary Blinken will host will highlight and celebrate the accomplishments of these extraordinary individuals.</p>
<p>And with that, thank you very much.  I’ll be happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Great, thank you very much.  Operator, if you want to repeat the instructions for asking questions.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your telephone keypad.  Please ensure your line is open before starting your question.  Once again, please press 1 then 0 on your telephone keypad.  One moment, please.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Okay, let’s start with the line of Missy Ryan, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks.  And thanks very much for this briefing.  I just had a question about Afghanistan, and I see that – so if I understood correctly, it’s on Tier 3 for the – is it – am I correct to say second year?  And so I’m wondering what the impact, if any, is on American assistance to Afghanistan currently or in the future, and what the situation is around that.  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yes, thank you so much for that question.  Afghanistan did again demonstrate a government policy or pattern of human trafficking and will therefore again appear on Tier 3.  As you noted, Tier 3 countries may carry restrictions for non-humanitarian and non-trade-related assistance.  The president may waive those restrictions, as he did for Afghanistan when it was placed on Tier 3 in the 2020 TIP Report.  Those restrictions go into effect for the next fiscal year, so he waived the restrictions for this fiscal year that went into – that began in October.  This summer, there will be a process of preparing recommendations to inform the President’s decisions for the countries that appear on Tier 3 in the 2021 TIP Report, and we expect that the President will make those decisions before the beginning of the next fiscal year in October.</p>
<p>And you are right, this is the second year that Afghanistan is on Tier 3 for a government policy or pattern of human trafficking.  Specifically, the report notes in the area of the use and recruitment of child soldiers as well as a widespread practice of bacha bazi, which is essentially sexual slavery on government compounds.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  We’ll go to the line of Matt Lee.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Matt, I think – yeah, I think your line’s open.  Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah.  All right.  I assume you can hear me, so I’m just going to go ahead and do it.  I’m sorry, these are kind of logistical questions.  Could you just repeat the list of six countries downgraded from Tier 1 to Tier 2?  And also, were there any countries that moved from Tier 3 up?  And then the last one is:  For Guinea-Bissau and Malaysia, are those – those were demoted because of the statutory time that they could be exempted or put into the Watch List, or was there demonstrable regression in their approach?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yeah, thank you for all those questions.  I hope I got them all.  If I missed any, feel – please feel free to repeat them.</p>
<p>The six countries that were downgraded from Tier 1 to Tier 2 include Cyprus, Israel, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, and Switzerland.  There were four countries upgraded from Tier 3 this year.  They include Belarus, Burundi, Lesotho, and Papua New Guinea.  And the two countries that were downgraded to Tier 3, Guinea-Bissau and Malaysia, were in fact both out of time on the Watch List.  They had exceeded their time.  They had been on the Watch List for three years, and therefore were no longer able legally to stay on the Watch List and did not make enough progress to support an upgrade to Tier 2, and therefore were automatically downgraded to Tier 3.</p>
<p>Did I get all your questions?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Sounded like you did.  Let’s go on to the line of Lara Jakes, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, good morning.  Is my line open?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Great, thanks.  In terms of the pandemic’s impact on human trafficking, can you give us a little more sense of what kind of trends you saw that were more prevalent or more alarming than in years past that were directly caused by the pandemic?  I was looking in the – kind of the executive summary.  I see that there was a trend of the – perhaps the pandemic had spurred more migration and made people more vulnerable to trafficking.  I also saw a large section on stay-at-home sex trafficking victims.</p>
<p>And I’m just wondering, which – not that this is a zero-sum game, but which one of these trends seemed to grow at a more alarming rate directly caused by the pandemic?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thank you for those important questions.  We have spent a lot of time this year gathering information and carefully analyzing the effects of the pandemic on trafficking trends, on trafficking victims and survivors, as well as government and service providers’ response to trafficking.</p>
<p>Overall, the concurrence of the increased number of individuals at risk due to the pandemic, traffickers’ ability to capitalize on competing crises, and the diversion of resources to pandemic response efforts has resulted, in many ways, in an ideal environment for human trafficking to flourish and evolve.</p>
<p>Despite these added challenges and risks that the pandemic presented, we have also witnessed the adaptability among those continuing to fight human trafficking and their dedication to ensuring the continuation of anti-trafficking efforts and minimize the effects of the pandemic on victims and the broader anti-trafficking community.</p>
<p>To your question about some of the specific effects, we did see that during the pandemic, anti-trafficking stakeholders experienced a number of conditions that made work to combat trafficking in persons exceptionally difficult.  Governments faced reduced capacities as priorities shifted to focus on growing health and economic concerns.  Victims and survivors faced heightened risk of re-victimization and obstacles accessing assistance and support as lockdowns, social distancing protocols, and a lack of resources caused survivor service providers to close shelters and reduce services.</p>
<p>Technology, as you noted, was widely utilized both to safely continue to combat trafficking such as to – you noted the negatives.  I’ll note the positives first and then the negatives.  Technology was also used to resume prosecution efforts and investigation efforts and to prevent further court backlogs through virtual investigative and court proceedings.</p>
<p>We did, unfortunately, also see that the increased use of technology created more vulnerability that traffickers unfortunately also exploited, as you noted, through online sex trafficking.  Also traffickers used the internet and other remote connectivity options to recruit trafficking victims, often with fraudulent job offers, so we did see, unfortunately, that that was a trend.  Thankfully, we saw the governments, service providers, NGOs, and many survivors themselves were resilient and adapted to the evolving situation as well.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Go the line of Humeyra Pamuk.  Humeyra Pamuk.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I’m assuming everyone can hear me, so I’ll just go ahead.  I just want to ask – I see that Turkey has moved to the list of countries who are implicated in the use of child soldiers.  I just want to confirm if this is the first time a NATO member is on this list, and I just want to also ask a little bit about methodology.  There have been reports that the – some of the Syrian factions that Turkey has supported have been involved in various human rights abuses, use of child soldiers.  The fact that the country made it to this list this year, does that mean the United States has now independently verified these reports?</p>
<p>And my final question is:  How does this impact any military cooperation with Turkey?  I’m well aware that there is a specific distinction in attribution to the armed groups that it supports and not the country’s armed forces, but still, U.S. is in the middle of negotiating a really important deal for Turkey to run the Kabul airport, and I’m looking at the report and it says – it talks about a number of restrictions on security assistance and a few other things, and Turkey is seeking financial and various military support to run the Kabul airport from United States.  Would that have any impact on it if that’s the case?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yeah, thank you very much for that important question.  The United States places considerable attention on the issue of the unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers.  The United States condemns the practice of unlawfully recruiting or using child soldiers and work to end this practice, which is considered a form of human trafficking in certain circumstances, and we work to do so wherever it occurs.  Through this abhorrent practice, governments and government-supported armed groups rob innocent children of their childhoods and may cause them to commit terrible violence, in some cases against their own loved ones.</p>
<p>Across the globe, wherever we see this occurring, we raise this issue through both military and civilian channels, and we work with concerned citizens, the United Nations, and nongovernmental organizations.  Our aim is to monitor, report on, and prevent the unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers, as well as to protect, assist, and rehabilitate these children, including by working with civil society and governments of countries where governments or government-supported armed groups unlawfully recruit or use child soldiers.</p>
<p>And I want to pause on that last sentence just to note that that is the legal standard, that the Child Soldier Prevention Act requires the State Department to list countries on this list where either governments or government-supported armed groups are unlawfully recruiting or using child soldiers.  And through this list, the United States puts on notice those countries where we do have credible information of the recruitment or use of child soldiers.  We take these allegations very seriously.  We conduct in-depth research on all relevant information and engage directly with governments year-round regarding these concerns.</p>
<p>With respect to Turkey in particular, you are correct that this is the first time a NATO member has been listed on the Child Soldier Prevention Act list.  As a respected regional leader and member of NATO, Turkey has the opportunity to address this issue, the recruitment and use of child soldiers in Syria and Libya.  We did determine and document in this report that the Government of Turkey provided support to the Sultan Murad Division, a non-state armed group that recruited and used child soldiers.  This division is a Syrian armed opposition group that operates under the umbrella of the Turkish-supported Syrian National Army.  The Government of Turkey provided tangible support to the Sultan Murad Division which included transit through Turkish territory during the reporting period of – as I said before, that reporting period is April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021.  The United States hopes to work with Turkey to encourage all groups involved in the Syrian and Libyan conflicts not to use child soldiers, and we hope to work with Turkey to address this issue in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Michel Ghandour.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes.  What does the Tier 3 list include other than China, Cuba, and Afghanistan?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  There – it’s a fairly long list.  There are 15 countries, I think, on the list.  I’m happy to read you the list of countries that are on Tier 3 in alphabetical order.  They include Afghanistan, as we already discussed; Algeria, Burma, China, Comoros, Cuba, Eritrea, Guinea Bissau, Iran, North Korea, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Russia, South Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.  Sorry, it’s 17; I counted wrong.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We&#8217;ll take a couple final questions.  Let’s go to Jiha Ham, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, I hope you can hear me.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We can.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you for doing this.  Thank you for taking my question.  I have a question on North Korea.  So the report on North Korea, it says the Chinese Government often sends North Korea defectors back to North Korea forcibly.  But according to the report, because of the COVID, North Korean authorities in 2020 refused to accept more than 200 defectors.  I&#8217;m sure they are still in China, because the border is still closed between the two countries.  So my question is:  Were there any efforts that the U.S. Government tried to intervene the situation or directly at China not to send these defectors back to North Korea?  If not, what will be your message to China?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yeah, thank you for that question.  We have long noted concerns in the TIP Report in both the China and the North Korea narrative for many years, our concerns about defectors or other North Korean nationals being returned to North Korea and the risk that they face to forced labor, other forms of trafficking, and other human rights abuses, if they are returned.  We have included a recommendation in the China narrative for many years and have raised this issue with the Chinese Government.  We encourage them not to return people back to North Korea, particularly without screening for human trafficking, since we know this is a population that’s particularly vulnerable to human trafficking.  Obviously, we have much broader human rights concerns in North Korea, and this is one of many issues that we raise with the Chinese Government.  And we publicly note our concerns about North Korea.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>We’ll go to the line of Mouhamed Elahmed.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, .  Thank you for doing this.  I have couple of questions, please.  I was skimming over the report, and it seems that the Syrian refugees, especially women and children, have been trafficked, used, and exploited in so many countries in the Middle East, like Egypt for example.  So how does this represent the challenge to the U.S. efforts to address this issue in the Middle East?  Are there any programs that the USAID, for example, is planning to provide to help those victims to rehabilitate?</p>
<p>And finally, do you think that by solving the refugee crisis in Syria or even in Yemen, would that help in reduce or eliminate the trafficking persons in the Middle East that has been increased in the recent years?  Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yeah, thank you for that question.  You are right that – to point out that Syrian refugees are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking and all kinds of other hostilities throughout the region.  We have long documented those concerns and trafficking abuses that occur, that traffickers target Syrian refugees, as they do many other refugees and migrants, both in the Middle East region and more broadly in the world.  They comprise a group of people that traffickers recognize often do not have a safety net around them. They may not have family relatives; they may not have a lot of other options to seek help and support.  And therefore, traffickers often prey and target specifically refugees and migrants.  And sadly, that is very true for Syrian refugees and migrants in the region as well.</p>
<p>We have included recommendations for many years for countries in the region, both the Middle East and I would also say European countries that have also hosted or through which Syrian migrants and refugees have traveled, and urge those governments to screen for trafficking indicators and identify proactively trafficking victims among this group so that they can get them the care that they need, that is tailored for trafficking victims to prevent their future exploitation and potential re-trafficking as well.  We’ve also used some of our foreign assistance funds specifically to raise awareness and build governments’ capacity in the region to identify and provide care for those trafficking victims among this group.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Well, we will leave it there.  I want to thank our speaker.  Again, this call was on background.  You can refer to our speaker as a senior State Department official, and the call is embargoed until approximately one o&#8217;clock today, when the event with Secretary Blinken begins.  We will have additional opportunities for you to hear from the Secretary and from senior State Department officials today, including at the press briefing on the rollout of the 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report.  Thanks, everyone, for joining, and we’ll talk to you later today.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States is committed to improving social, economic, and political conditions in Central America because U.S. security and prosperity is tied to the success of our regional partners. Actions that undermine the rule of law and democracy in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, and their repercussions on the lives of people in these countries, contribute to irregular migration and destabilize entire societies.  As stated in the recent U.S. Presidential Decree Establishing the Fight Against Corruption as a Core U.S. National Security Interest: “<em>Corruption corrodes public trust; hobbles effective governance; distorts markets and equitable access to services; undercuts development efforts; contributes to national fragility, extremism, and migration; and provides authoritarian leaders a means to undermine democracies worldwide.  When leaders steal from their nations’ citizens or oligarchs flout the rule of law, economic growth slows, inequality widens, and trust in government plummets.”</em></p>
<p>The citizens of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador have consistently repudiated corruption, demanded accountability on the part of their governments and private actors in their countries, and acted in defense of democratic institutions. The United States stands with those citizens, organizations, and public servants who are committed to promoting the public good and generating hope and opportunity for the people of the region, even in the face of setbacks to the rule of law and efforts to combat impunity.</p>
<p>In the context of this support, the U.S. Government is issuing a public list, consistent with section 353 of the United States–Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act, of individuals who have knowingly engaged in acts that undermine democratic processes or institutions, engaged in significant corruption, or obstructed investigations into such acts of corruption in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.  Section 353 generally requires that individuals listed in this report are ineligible for visas and admission to the United States.</p>
<p>We will continue partnering with government officials who show a dedication to combating corruption and strengthening democratic governance, including as part of an overall policy of addressing the root causes of irregular migration.  Our objective with these designations is to support the people of  Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in their efforts to form a democratic, prosperous, and safe region where people can contribute to and benefit from the democratic process, have confidence in public institutions, reduce inequality, and enjoy opportunities to create the futures they desire for themselves and their families.</p>

<p>Women are a powerful force for peace and essential partners in advancing international security.  The United States has long championed the safe, meaningful participation of women in our diplomatic, development, and defense efforts.  As underscored by the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Act of 2017 and our support of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and other relevant WPS resolutions, the United States recognizes and promotes the essential role of women in political and security arenas.  This includes women’s essential role in the prevention, management, and resolution of conflict, and their contributions to stabilization efforts, peacekeeping, and post-conflict relief and recovery.  We also remain firmly committed to advancing the human rights of women and girls as a core element of our foreign policy.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, as well as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of State is proud to release its first public report on the implementation of the 2019 U.S. Strategy on WPS and the Department’s 2020 WPS Implementation Plan.  This marks the first time that the Department has led a comprehensive data-driven monitoring, evaluation, and learning exercise on our WPS efforts.  Over the past year, the Department has made significant progress in implementing this vision, including: support for more than 14,000 women to build capacity for peace and reconciliation, training for more than 43,000 women in security and criminal justice sectors, and support for access to gender-based violence prevention and response services for nearly 488,000 individuals during Fiscal Years 2019 and 2020.  More findings are available at <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/USG-Women-Peace-and-Security-Congressional-Report-June-2021.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/USG-Women-Peace-and-Security-Congressional-Report-June-2021.pdf</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a>.</p>
<p>The United States is proud to continue its long-standing role as a global champion for women on the frontlines of policy, peace, and security decision-making processes and advancing the safety of women and girls.  We know that when women are engaged in peace and security efforts, we are all safer, more prosperous, and more secure.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>2:00 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:  </strong>Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you so much for joining today’s briefing.  I have two quick announcements to make at the top and then we’ll start taking your questions.</p>
<p>As the Secretary announced in a statement today, the department is beginning the process of updating its policies regarding gender markers on U.S. passports and consular reports of birth abroad to better serve all U.S. citizens, regardless of their gender.</p>
<p>Starting today, applicants seeking to change the gender marker on their passport will no longer be required to submit medical certification.  They will self-select their gender, and it does not need to match the gender listed on the applicant’s citizenship and identity documents or prior U.S. passports.</p>
<p>The department has also begun moving towards adding a gender marker for non-binary, intersex, and gender non-conforming persons, and will be evaluating the best approach to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>The process of adding a gender marker is complex and will take some time for extensive systems updates.  Nonetheless, we are committed to getting this right and express our enduring commitment for the LGBTQI+ community today and every day moving forward.</p>
<p>Next, as you’ve recently seen, the United States International Development Finance Corporation announced financing to support a 600 million euro loan for Aspen Pharma in South Africa.  Together with financing from DEG Germany, Proparco France, and the International Finance Corporation, DFC’s financing will expand capacity for COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing to Africa.  This financing will help increase capacity to support Aspen’s effort to produce COVID-19 vaccines with Stringent Regulatory Authorization and/or World Health Organization Emergency Use Listing, including the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.   This investment in African ingenuity and resilience is the first announcement of several deals the DFC is pursuing to expand vaccine manufacturing globally.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement is another example of our leadership, in concert with our partners and international institutions, to lead the global response to this pandemic.  This effort also demonstrates U.S. work with partner nations and local manufacturers to create the kind of global vaccine production and manufacturing capacity and capabilities that not only can help the world beat this pandemic, but also help prepare the world to respond to future threats.</p>
<p>And with that, let’s go over to the line of Nike Ching.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello, Jalina.  Thank you so much for the call, briefing.  On Afghanistan, Secretary Blinken has said the U.S. is, quote, “working to make good on our obligations to those who helped us with the Special Immigrant Visa program,” end of quote.  My question:  Can we please have an update on efforts to get Afghan interpreters, drivers, fixers, and others who helped the U.S. out of the country?  Also, on the evacuation and relocation efforts, can we please have a breakdown of evacuating the civilian or military aircraft?  And which third countries at least have agreed to take them in before they obtain the visas to enter into the U.S.?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Well, let me start off by saying that I certainly support and want to uplift what you mentioned about the Secretary and our commitment to this.  And I’ll just reiterate that we’re actively working on every way possible to make sure that we can help those who have helped us.  We’ve identified a group of SIV applicants who’ve served as interpreters and translators, as well as other individuals who have assisted us and that are at risk.  They and their families will have the option to be relocated outside of Afghanistan before we complete our military drawdown by September in order to complete their special immigrant processing.</p>
<p>At this time, we don’t have any further details to share or specific numbers.  We will provide additional information when we’re able to do so.  However, due to security constraints, we’ll be limited on how much we can share in terms of those numbers, locations, and timing of all these operations.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Michel Ghandour, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  Thank you for the conference call.  I asked you about the French, Saudi, and U.S. meeting yesterday in Italy on Lebanon.  And do you have anything today, any update on this, any readout?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Thank you, Michel.  I don’t have any update to share at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Said Arikat.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you, Jalina.  I hope you can hear me well.  Jalina, there’s been some reports that the PA has given the Biden administration 30 objectives for negotiations with Israel.  So I wonder if you could confirm this or if there are any other discussions that are going underway.  And second, my second issue is that demolition in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan are ongoing, and I wonder if you – have you spoken with the Israelis?  Have you urged them not to demolish Palestinians’ homes and so on, and not to do any evictions?  Thank you, Jalina.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:  </strong>So to your first question on the 30 objectives, I’ll just say that we won’t discuss the content of any of our internal diplomatic discussions.  And to your second question, we’ve seen reports that some families made up of approximately 50 Palestinians have been ordered to demolish their homes, and we believe that it’s critical to refrain from any unilateral steps that increase tensions and that would make it more difficult to advance a negotiated two-state solution.  This obviously includes demolitions.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Pearl Matibe, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  I really appreciate your availability, so thank you so much for this.  My question is regarding the Kingdom of Eswatini.  What is the U.S. assessment or intelligence on the developments and reports that the government was losing control, that now military are abusing citizens, the internet has been shut down?  Have you got any readout on this absolute monarch, the only last monarch in Africa?  I don’t know, what is your – what is the Biden administration’s assessment of what is going on?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Thank you for your question and for calling in today, Pearl.  I’ll just start off by saying that we’re certainly following the situation in Eswatini, of course, where protesters are demanding political reform and they are clashing both with the police and the military.  That said, the situation is fluid and we urge the government to exercise restraint and also maintain the utmost respect for human rights.  Of course, as the situation continues to unfold, the United States urges all stakeholders in this situation to not only remain calm but also remain peaceful.  And it goes without saying that the United States strongly supports freedom of expression as well as freedom of peaceful assembly, and that we know an inclusive and peaceful dialogue is essential to progress moving forward.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Jiha Ham, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Hey, yes, I can hear you.  How are you?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  I’m good, thanks.  The North Korean leader Kim Jong-un yesterday said that some officials there caused a crucial case of creating a great crisis related to COVID-19.  Do you have any comments on this, on the current COVID situation in North Korea?  Also, do you have any plans to share humanitarian assistance, including the vaccines?  We learned yesterday that North Korea is not on the list of countries that would get 80 million doses of vaccines that the U.S. will share globally.  Is there any reason – any reason that the U.S. administration excluded North Korea?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  So to answer your first question, we’re certainly aware of reports of what Kim Jong-un has said, but we don’t have any comment from here.  And to your second question, just to reiterate, the Biden administration has taken a strong leadership position on being the leader with vaccine diplomacy, and we will continue to do so from here on out.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Michele Kelemen.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks.  I’d like to go back to your answer to Nike’s question at the top about Afghanistan.  You said that you’ve – that the State Department has identified those who will have the option to leave.  Have you informed those people that they have this option?  Do you have commitments from other countries willing to house them temporarily?  And can you confirm that it’s the State Department rather than the Defense Department in charge of this evacuation process?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Thanks, Michele.  I’ll just continue to reiterate we don’t have any specific details on numbers or on timing to preview from here, but of course as that information is made available, we’ll certainly share.  And most importantly, due to security restraints, we’re just limited on how much we can share in terms of those numbers and locations at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Missy Ryan, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi there.  Thanks for taking my question.  I’d like to actually just follow up on Michele’s question regarding the SIV transport and evacuation.  My understanding is that the U.S. military withdrawal is expected to be completed within the next few days barring any additional tasking for the military to be responsible for transporting the SIV applicants outside of Afghanistan.  And can you just address, is it safe to assume, then, that the administration is going to – that the military is not going to be transporting them out of the country, and that they’ll go by a commercial aircraft.  Is it – I mean, one of the confusing things, I think, has been when people are trying to understand what’s going on with the military withdrawal is whether or not the SIV process is going to lengthen the military presence in Afghanistan in these final weeks that they get really close to zero there.  Anything you could provide on that would be helpful, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Specific to the military drawdown, the President has made clear that we will complete that from Afghanistan by early September.  Any other specifics outside of that, I will have to refer you to the DOD.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Hiba Nasr.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Inaudible) Jalina, thanks for taking my question.  I – first I missed your answer on the demolition of the Palestinian homes, if you can repeat it.  And I want to ask two question, if I may.  First, if you have any comment on the trial of Entisar Al-Hammadi, the Yemeni model.  The trial is carried out by the – is carried by the Houthis.  And on the missile attack by the Houthis on Marib, and it killed three persons, including a child.  And also I have a question on Ethiopia.  Assistant secretary – acting assistant secretary for African Affairs said yesterday that if the government’s – the Ethiopian Government’s – announcement of a cessation of hostilities does not result in improvement in the situation and the situation continues to worsen, Ethiopia and Eritrea should anticipate further actions.  So are you going to impose more sanctions?  Can you elaborate on that, please?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  So for that, I don’t have any sanctions to preview from here.  But can you repeat your other question?  I think you mentioned something about the Houthis.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes.  First, if you have any comment on the trial of the Yemeni actress, Entisar Al-Hammadi.  And the missile attack carried by the Houthis on Marib.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  I don’t have anything for you on that.  We’ll have to take that back from you today, but I believe you also asked me to repeat the question posed by Said.  And I’ll just quickly say that, again, we’ve seen the reports that seven families that are made up of about 50 Palestinians have been ordered for their homes to be demolished.  And we believe it’s critical to refrain from any unilateral steps that would increase tensions or make it more difficult to advance our two-state solution, and that would include demolition.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Abigail Williams.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  Nice to talk to you.  I wanted to follow up on Said’s line of questioning.  Does the State Department have any response to the decision reached on the West Bank outpost of Evyatar?  And are you concerned (inaudible) the confrontations between the Israeli police and demonstrators there that resulted in the death of four protesters?  And more broadly, can you provide the latest guidance on the State Department’s review of the previous administration’s decision to disavow the 1978 memo that described Israeli settlements as inconsistent with international law?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Thanks, Abbie.  For your second question, I’ll have to take that back for you.  But just to answer your first, again, I’ll continue to underscore that we believe it’s critical to refrain from any unilateral steps that would exacerbate tensions or undercut efforts to advance equal freedoms, security, and prosperity, as well as a negotiated two-state solution.  And this would include establishing outposts which are illegal even under Israeli law.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Joseph Haboush, please.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Joseph, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  I wanted to ask if you could provide any readout or more details of Secretary Blinken’s meeting yesterday with his Saudi and French counterparts, where he tweeted the need – tweeted about the need for Lebanon’s political leaders to implement overdue reforms.  And is there any – is there continued concern over the situation in Lebanon?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  So we don’t have anything for you today, but happy to take this and answer this offline.</p>
<p>Let’s take one final question from Kristina Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, thank you for taking my question.  In Afghanistan, there’s an awful lot of worry over the degrading – what some people describe as a degrading situation as the military is withdrawing or retrograding.  Could you talk a little bit, please, about the hopeful situation ahead for diplomacy and political opportunities for peace in the country and reconciliation?  Is there a framework ahead?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Thank you for your question.  What I will say is that the United States is committed to our enduring partnership with Afghanistan as well as the Afghan people, and that would include everything from security, civilian, and humanitarian assistance.  And again, we agree that political unity is the way forward and diplomacy is the path of – the way forward.  I wouldn’t want to preview anything else beyond that, but just would underscore that we are committed to not only Afghanistan, and the people of Afghanistan as well.</p>
<p>That concludes today’s briefing.  Thank you all so much for joining today, and we hope you have a good week ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:20 p.m.)</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks.  I’d like to go back to your answer to Nike’s question at the top about Afghanistan.  You said that you’ve – that the State Department has identified those who will have the option to leave.  Have you informed those people that they have this option?  Do you have commitments from other countries willing to house them temporarily?  And can you confirm that it’s the State Department rather than the Defense Department in charge of this evacuation process?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Thanks, Michele.  I’ll just continue to reiterate we don’t have any specific details on numbers or on timing to preview from here, but of course as that information is made available, we’ll certainly share.  And most importantly, due to security restraints, we’re just limited on how much we can share in terms of those numbers and locations at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Missy Ryan, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi there.  Thanks for taking my question.  I’d like to actually just follow up on Michele’s question regarding the SIV transport and evacuation.  My understanding is that the U.S. military withdrawal is expected to be completed within the next few days barring any additional tasking for the military to be responsible for transporting the SIV applicants outside of Afghanistan.  And can you just address, is it safe to assume, then, that the administration is going to – that the military is not going to be transporting them out of the country, and that they’ll go by a commercial aircraft.  Is it – I mean, one of the confusing things, I think, has been when people are trying to understand what’s going on with the military withdrawal is whether or not the SIV process is going to lengthen the military presence in Afghanistan in these final weeks that they get really close to zero there.  Anything you could provide on that would be helpful, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Specific to the military drawdown, the President has made clear that we will complete that from Afghanistan by early September.  Any other specifics outside of that, I will have to refer you to the DOD.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Hiba Nasr.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Inaudible) Jalina, thanks for taking my question.  I – first I missed your answer on the demolition of the Palestinian homes, if you can repeat it.  And I want to ask two question, if I may.  First, if you have any comment on the trial of Entisar Al-Hammadi, the Yemeni model.  The trial is carried out by the – is carried by the Houthis.  And on the missile attack by the Houthis on Marib, and it killed three persons, including a child.  And also I have a question on Ethiopia.  Assistant secretary – acting assistant secretary for African Affairs said yesterday that if the government’s – the Ethiopian Government’s – announcement of a cessation of hostilities does not result in improvement in the situation and the situation continues to worsen, Ethiopia and Eritrea should anticipate further actions.  So are you going to impose more sanctions?  Can you elaborate on that, please?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  So for that, I don’t have any sanctions to preview from here.  But can you repeat your other question?  I think you mentioned something about the Houthis.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes.  First, if you have any comment on the trial of the Yemeni actress, Entisar Al-Hammadi.  And the missile attack carried by the Houthis on Marib.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  I don’t have anything for you on that.  We’ll have to take that back from you today, but I believe you also asked me to repeat the question posed by Said.  And I’ll just quickly say that, again, we’ve seen the reports that seven families that are made up of about 50 Palestinians have been ordered for their homes to be demolished.  And we believe it’s critical to refrain from any unilateral steps that would increase tensions or make it more difficult to advance our two-state solution, and that would include demolition.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Abigail Williams.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  Nice to talk to you.  I wanted to follow up on Said’s line of questioning.  Does the State Department have any response to the decision reached on the West Bank outpost of Evyatar?  And are you concerned (inaudible) the confrontations between the Israeli police and demonstrators there that resulted in the death of four protesters?  And more broadly, can you provide the latest guidance on the State Department’s review of the previous administration’s decision to disavow the 1978 memo that described Israeli settlements as inconsistent with international law?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Thanks, Abbie.  For your second question, I’ll have to take that back for you.  But just to answer your first, again, I’ll continue to underscore that we believe it’s critical to refrain from any unilateral steps that would exacerbate tensions or undercut efforts to advance equal freedoms, security, and prosperity, as well as a negotiated two-state solution.  And this would include establishing outposts which are illegal even under Israeli law.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Joseph Haboush, please.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Joseph, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  I wanted to ask if you could provide any readout or more details of Secretary Blinken’s meeting yesterday with his Saudi and French counterparts, where he tweeted the need – tweeted about the need for Lebanon’s political leaders to implement overdue reforms.  And is there any – is there continued concern over the situation in Lebanon?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  So we don’t have anything for you today, but happy to take this and answer this offline.</p>
<p>Let’s take one final question from Kristina Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, thank you for taking my question.  In Afghanistan, there’s an awful lot of worry over the degrading – what some people describe as a degrading situation as the military is withdrawing or retrograding.  Could you talk a little bit, please, about the hopeful situation ahead for diplomacy and political opportunities for peace in the country and reconciliation?  Is there a framework ahead?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Thank you for your question.  What I will say is that the United States is committed to our enduring partnership with Afghanistan as well as the Afghan people, and that would include everything from security, civilian, and humanitarian assistance.  And again, we agree that political unity is the way forward and diplomacy is the path of – the way forward.  I wouldn’t want to preview anything else beyond that, but just would underscore that we are committed to not only Afghanistan, and the people of Afghanistan as well.</p>
<p>That concludes today’s briefing.  Thank you all so much for joining today, and we hope you have a good week ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:20 p.m.)</p>
