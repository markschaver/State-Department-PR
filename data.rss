					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is designating six individuals for their support of the terrorist group Boko Haram.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has added Nigerian nationals Abdurrahman Ado Musa, Salihu Yusuf Adamu, Bashir Ali Yusuf, Muhammed Ibrahim Isa, Ibrahim Ali Alhassan, and Surajo Abubakar Muhammad to the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, pursuant to Executive Order 13224, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Boko Haram.</p>
<p>Today’s action follows the United Arab Emirates’ prosecutions, convictions, and designations of these individuals for supporting terrorism.  The Department of State designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization on November 14, 2013.  The Nigeria-based group is responsible for numerous attacks in the northern and northeastern regions of the country as well as in the Lake Chad Basin in Cameroon, Chad, and Niger that have killed thousands of people since 2009.</p>

		<title>Rewards for Justice – Reward Offer for Information on Russian FSB Officers Conducting Malicious Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure Between 2012-2017</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program is now offering a reward for information on Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov for their alleged involvement in computer intrusions, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and damage to the property of an energy facility offenses.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement marks the first time that RFJ has named any foreign government security personnel under its critical infrastructure reward offer.</p>
<p>RFJ, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of Akulov, Gavrilov, Tyukov, or any other person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of a foreign government, aids or abets a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which may include participation in malicious cyber activities against U.S. critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>These officers were members of an FSB component known as Center 16 and worked at a specific operational group known as Military Unit 71330, known by cybersecurity researchers as “Dragonfly,” “Energetic Bear,” and “Crouching Yeti.”</p>
<p>These FSB officers conspired to commit computer intrusions, including “supply chain attacks,” in furtherance of the Russian government’s efforts to maintain surreptitious, unauthorized, and persistent access to the computer networks of companies and other entities in the international energy sector, including oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants, and other utility and electrical grid companies.  Specifically, the conspirators targeted the software and hardware that controls equipment in power generation facilities, known as industrial control systems or supervisory control and data acquisition systems.  Access to such systems would have provided the Russian government the ability to, among other things, disrupt and damage such computer systems at a future date of its choosing..</p>
<p>In total, the defendants and the co-conspirators targeted more than 500 U.S. and foreign energy-sector companies in 135 other countries.  In just one phase of their hacking campaign, the conspirators installed malware on more than 17,000 unique devices worldwide.</p>
<p>More information about this reward offer is located on the Rewards for Justice website at <a class="external-link" href="https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/foreign-malicious-cyber-activity-against-u-s-critical-infrastructure/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/malicious_cyber_activity.html</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>. We encourage anyone with information on the malicious cyberactivity of Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov to contact Rewards for Justice via the Tor-based tips-reporting channel at: he5dybnt7sr6cm32xt77pazmtm65flqy6irivtflruqfc5ep7eiodiad.onion (Tor browser required).</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1984, the program has paid in excess of $200 million to more than 100 people across the globe who provided actionable information that helped prevent terrorism, bring terrorist leaders to justice, and resolve threats to U.S. national security. Follow us on Twitter at <a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program is offering a reward for information on Russia-based hacker Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement marks the first time that RFJ has listed a specific cyber actor under its critical infrastructure reward offer.</p>
<p>RFJ, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of Gladkikh or any other person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of a foreign government, aids or abets a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which may include participation in malicious cyber activities against U.S. critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Between May and September 2017, Gladkikh, a computer programmer employed by a leading research organization of the Russian Ministry of Defense, and co-conspirators hacked the systems of a refinery located outside the United States and installed malware designed to prevent the refinery’s safety systems from functioning (<i>i.e.</i>, by causing the industrial control system to operate in an unsafe manner while maintaining the appearance that it was operating normally).  Between February and July 2018, the conspirators researched similar refineries in the United States, which were owned by a U.S. company, and unsuccessfully attempted to hack the U.S. company’s computer systems.</p>
<p>Gladkikh conducted these malicious offensive cyber operations as an employee of the Russian Ministry of Defense’s Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (a.k.a. “TsNIIKhM”), in its Applied Development Center, with other co-conspirators.</p>
<p>More information about this reward offer is located on the Rewards for Justice website at <a class="external-link" href="https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/foreign-malicious-cyber-activity-against-u-s-critical-infrastructure/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/malicious_cyber_activity.html</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>. We encourage anyone with information on Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh’s malicious cyberactivity to contact Rewards for Justice via the Tor-based tips-reporting channel at: he5dybnt7sr6cm32xt77pazmtm65flqy6irivtflruqfc5ep7eiodiad.onion (Tor browser required).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and people of the United States of America, I congratulate the people of Greece as you celebrate the 201st anniversary of the founding of the Hellenic Republic.</p>
<p>Today, we celebrate the history and democratic values that unite our countries and peoples.  The United States views Greece as a key partner and NATO Ally as we advance our shared goals for peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, Western Balkans, Black Sea region, and beyond, strengthened by our updated Mutual Defense Cooperation Agreement.</p>
<p>Our relationship has never been more important than at this critical moment in history after the Russian government launched its unprovoked war in Ukraine, including against the Greek diaspora in Mariupol, a bastion of Hellenic identity.  On behalf of the United States, I thank Greece for its unyielding and steadfast support for Ukraine’s people, sovereignty, and democracy.</p>
<p>The founders of the United States drew inspiration from ancient Greece’s example, as they framed the U.S. Constitution and formed the world’s first modern democracy.  Inspired by these democratic ideals, American Philhellenes proudly stood shoulder to shoulder with the people of Greece as they, too, fought for their independence.  Building on the shared values that have guided our friendship for more than two centuries, our relationship is stronger now than ever, fostering security and prosperity for both our countries and the broader transatlantic alliance.</p>
<p>The United States continues to stand with Greece as we deepen our strong and historic relationship and take it to even greater heights, guided by democratic values that were born in Greece.  And so, I wish the people of Greece a year of peace, prosperity, and good health, as we celebrate another year of Greece’s independence.  Xronia Polla!</p>

<p>Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman spoke today with Republic of Korea (ROK) First Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong Kun and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Mori Takeo about continued trilateral U.S.-ROK-Japan cooperation regarding the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) March 24 intercontinental ballistic missile launch, which was a clear violation of multiple United Nation Security Council resolutions.  Deputy Secretary Sherman and her counterparts jointly condemned the DPRK’s increasingly escalatory launches and called on the DPRK to stop its destabilizing actions and return to diplomacy.  The Deputy Secretary also reaffirmed the ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of the ROK and Japan.  Deputy Secretary Sherman stressed the importance of close coordination with our allies and partners to address the threats posed by the DPRK and to advance our shared objective of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke today with Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa and they jointly condemned the DPRK’s March 24 Intercontinental ballistic missile launch as a clear violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions.  This provocation, which follows two ICBM tests earlier this year, further demonstrates the threat the DPRK’s unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs pose to the DPRK’s neighbors and the broader international community.  Secretary Blinken reaffirmed the U.S.-Japan Alliance as the cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, and committed to trilateral cooperation with Japan and the Republic of Korea towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  The Secretary reiterated the United States’ commitment to the defense of Japan and the Republic of Korea remains ironclad.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States welcomes and strongly supports the declaration today by the Government of Ethiopia of an indefinite humanitarian truce, effective immediately, and the commitment to work in collaboration with humanitarian organizations to expedite the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to all those in need.  We expect this declaration to be quickly followed by the movement of life-saving assistance.</p>
<p>This commitment to a cessation of hostilities should be a critical step towards the resumption and sustainment of humanitarian assistance to the people in Tigray and all Ethiopian regions and communities in need.  It should also serve as an essential foundation of an inclusive political process to achieve progress towards common security and prosperity for all the people of Ethiopia.  In the context of this commitment, we reiterate our call for an immediate end to the violence committed against civilians by all parties to the conflict and underscore that any lasting solution to the conflict must involve accountability for those responsible for atrocities.</p>
<p>The United States urges all parties to build on this announcement to advance a negotiated and sustainable ceasefire, including necessary security arrangements.  The United States will continue to do everything possible to assist and to help the people of Ethiopia to advance a peaceful future.</p>
