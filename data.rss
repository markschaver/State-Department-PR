		<title>Summit for Democracy &#8211; Year of Action Factsheet</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>On December 9-10, 2021, President Biden hosted the first of two Summits for Democracy, a global gathering of 100 government leaders, hundreds of members of civil society, and the business community, to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing democracies in the 21st century.  At the Summit, the U.S. Government announced that the time between leaders’ gatherings would constitute a Year of Action, during which the United States would work with partners to advance the commitments they made to one another to strengthen democracy, promote respect for human rights, and counter corruption and authoritarianism.</p>
<p>As Russia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion of its democratic neighbor Ukraine illustrates, defending democracy, contesting authoritarianism, and standing up for the human rights of all have never been more important to international peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Throughout the Year of Action, the U.S. Government will therefore encourage structured dialogue and action among governments and other stakeholders to advance commitments and initiatives announced by world leaders, and to report back on their progress at the second Summit.</p>
<p>To help facilitate progress and advance the Summit’s themes, the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other interagency partners will support a series of consultative processes that aim to:</p>
<ol>
<li>support governments in making verifiable progress on their commitments;</li>
<li>institutionalize Summit themes and commitments into existing platforms;</li>
<li>craft a Summit outcome document; and</li>
<li>develop an inclusive agenda for the second Summit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Across these efforts, the Department of State and USAID will engage with U.S. government interagency partners at the Departments of Labor, Treasury, Justice, and Commerce, as well as other relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>To achieve its objectives, the U.S. Government will:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Establish a Platform for Governments and Authorities to Advance Summit Goals</i>: We will create a Focal Group as an opportunity to engage collaboratively with our Summit government and official partners in the lead-up to the second Summit.  The U.S. government will coordinate the group and chair meetings; other focal points will be invited to participate in meetings and may lead working groups on specific aspects of planning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i></i><i>Build Multistakeholder Processes for Collaboration on Summit Goals</i>:  We will launch multistakeholder platforms, called Democracy Cohorts, to take concerted action toward commitment implementation in areas of common interest.  Each Democracy Cohort will bring together governments that demonstrate political will toward progress on Summit commitments in a specific issue area with key nongovernmental stakeholders invested in the outcome. The process will provide opportunities for meaningful dialogue and collaboration among civil society representatives, private <wbr />sector leaders, philanthropic partners, and government decision-makers on issues vital to good governance and democratic renewal.  The U.S. Government will co-lead a limited number of cohorts and will welcome other governments and civil society groups volunteering to spearhead additional cohorts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Engage Diverse and Expansive Nongovernmental Stakeholders</i>:  The U.S. Government will continue to hold informal, recurring consultations with a broad swath of nongovernmental organizations, philanthropies, and the private sector to discuss fulfillment of our Summit One commitments, as well as Year of Action and Summit Two plans. Other governments are strongly encouraged to hold their own, regular consultations with nongovernmental stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Tell the Story of Democracies Delivering</i>:<i> </i>The U.S. Government will spotlight and support examples of democracies delivering for citizens through messaging and public diplomacy programs, as well as highlight progress that countries make on their Summit commitments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Support the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal: </i>In the coming year, the U.S. government is planning to provide up to $424.4 million, working with Congress and subject to the availability of funds, toward the <a href="https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjAzMDkuNTQ2NzI3NTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9icmllZmluZy1yb29tL3N0YXRlbWVudHMtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS8xMi8wOS9mYWN0LXNoZWV0LWFubm91bmNpbmctdGhlLXByZXNpZGVudGlhbC1pbml0aWF0aXZlLWZvci1kZW1vY3JhdGljLXJlbmV3YWwvIn0.gzTaCoO4Ek8jt_FCOFoUl_KV_91pr10PtDODH9--sgo/s/1248191874/br/127839818951-l" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjAzMDkuNTQ2NzI3NTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9icmllZmluZy1yb29tL3N0YXRlbWVudHMtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS8xMi8wOS9mYWN0LXNoZWV0LWFubm91bmNpbmctdGhlLXByZXNpZGVudGlhbC1pbml0aWF0aXZlLWZvci1kZW1vY3JhdGljLXJlbmV3YWwvIn0.gzTaCoO4Ek8jt_FCOFoUl_KV_91pr10PtDODH9--sgo/s/1248191874/br/127839818951-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646955633522000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ONm-aqvI05PoDWg2Ezkxy">Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal</a>, a landmark set of policy and foreign assistance initiatives that build upon the U.S. government’s significant, ongoing work to bolster democracy and defend human rights globally.  We will also continue to explore opportunities to align resources outside of the Presidential Initiative with Summit themes, and to discuss coordination and alignment of Summit-related foreign assistance with other donors and multilateral organizations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Expand Congressional Outreach and Subnational Engagement</i>:  The U.S. Government will engage its own domestic leaders outside of the executive branch and will encourage other participating governments to similarly undertake a whole-of-government approach to advancing the Summit’s themes.  As part of this effort, we will also continue to engage, and seek to expand, partnership with the U.S. Congress on the Summit. In addition, the United States will encourage and participate in multilateral efforts to build momentum, such as by supporting the Mayors’ Initiative established at Summit One, and the expanded efforts of the House Democracy Partnership.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these efforts, we hope to inspire and support the flourishing of democracy around the world.  But these plans are not exhaustive.  Other interested stakeholders are encouraged to supplement U.S. government-led initiatives with their own efforts to promote democratic renewal, advance human rights, and counter corruption and authoritarianism in pursuit of a more just, secure, and peaceful world.</p>

<li><i>Support the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal: </i>In the coming year, the U.S. government is planning to provide up to $424.4 million, working with Congress and subject to the availability of funds, toward the <a href="https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjAzMDkuNTQ2NzI3NTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9icmllZmluZy1yb29tL3N0YXRlbWVudHMtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS8xMi8wOS9mYWN0LXNoZWV0LWFubm91bmNpbmctdGhlLXByZXNpZGVudGlhbC1pbml0aWF0aXZlLWZvci1kZW1vY3JhdGljLXJlbmV3YWwvIn0.gzTaCoO4Ek8jt_FCOFoUl_KV_91pr10PtDODH9--sgo/s/1248191874/br/127839818951-l" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjAzMDkuNTQ2NzI3NTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9icmllZmluZy1yb29tL3N0YXRlbWVudHMtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS8xMi8wOS9mYWN0LXNoZWV0LWFubm91bmNpbmctdGhlLXByZXNpZGVudGlhbC1pbml0aWF0aXZlLWZvci1kZW1vY3JhdGljLXJlbmV3YWwvIn0.gzTaCoO4Ek8jt_FCOFoUl_KV_91pr10PtDODH9--sgo/s/1248191874/br/127839818951-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646955633522000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ONm-aqvI05PoDWg2Ezkxy">Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal</a>, a landmark set of policy and foreign assistance initiatives that build upon the U.S. government’s significant, ongoing work to bolster democracy and defend human rights globally.  We will also continue to explore opportunities to align resources outside of the Presidential Initiative with Summit themes, and to discuss coordination and alignment of Summit-related foreign assistance with other donors and multilateral organizations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Expand Congressional Outreach and Subnational Engagement</i>:  The U.S. Government will engage its own domestic leaders outside of the executive branch and will encourage other participating governments to similarly undertake a whole-of-government approach to advancing the Summit’s themes.  As part of this effort, we will also continue to engage, and seek to expand, partnership with the U.S. Congress on the Summit. In addition, the United States will encourage and participate in multilateral efforts to build momentum, such as by supporting the Mayors’ Initiative established at Summit One, and the expanded efforts of the House Democracy Partnership.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these efforts, we hope to inspire and support the flourishing of democracy around the world.  But these plans are not exhaustive.  Other interested stakeholders are encouraged to supplement U.S. government-led initiatives with their own efforts to promote democratic renewal, advance human rights, and counter corruption and authoritarianism in pursuit of a more just, secure, and peaceful world.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Kremlin is intentionally spreading outright lies that the United States and Ukraine are conducting chemical and biological weapons activities in Ukraine.  We have also seen PRC officials echo these conspiracy theories.  This Russian disinformation is total nonsense and not the first time Russia has invented such false claims against another country.  Also, these claims have been debunked conclusively and repeatedly over many years.</p>
<p>As we have said all along, Russia is inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine. The United States does not own or operate any chemical or biological laboratories in Ukraine, it is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention, and it does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere. It is Russia that has active chemical and biological weapons programs and is in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention.</p>
<p>Finally, Russia has a track record of accusing the West of the very crimes that Russia itself is perpetrating. These tactics are an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attacks on Ukraine. We fully expect Russia to continue to double down on these sorts of claims with further unfounded allegations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p align="left">The U.S. government is deeply concerned by the injustice and lack of transparency on display at the trials of political prisoners in Nicaragua. We remain committed to supporting the people of Nicaragua by fighting corruption and promoting democracy, the rule of law, and accountability, which are keys to a brighter future.  To advance this priority, today we add nine Nicaraguans to the United States’ Corrupt and Undemocratic Actors list, under Section 353 of the United States–Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act, as amended. The Act generally makes the listed individuals ineligible for visas and admission to the United States.  The Reinforcing Nicaragua’s Adherence to Conditions for Electoral Reform Act of 2021 (RENACER) Act, passed with broad bipartisan support and signed by President Biden on November 10, 2021, expanded the Corrupt and Undemocratic Actors list to include Nicaragua.</p>
<p align="left">The State Department adds the following nine Nicaraguan government officials to the list for undermining the democratic processes or institutions of Nicaragua:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cairo Melvin Amador</b>, current Vice President of the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE), <b>Lumberto Ignacio Campbell Hooker</b>, current CSE member and Acting CSE President from 2018 until May 2021, and <b>Brenda Isabel Rocha Chacon</b>, current CSE President, for conspiring with the Ortega-Murillo regime to undermine Nicaragua’s political institutions and subvert the November 2021 national election by disqualifying legitimate opposition parties and candidates on spurious grounds.<b></b></li>
<li><b>Edwin Ramon Castro Rivera</b>, member of the Nicaraguan National Assembly since 1997 and head of the FSLN caucus since 2007, for ensuring Ortega-Murillo loyalists won all magistrate positions in the CSE and ensuring the passage of extremely broad legislation that the Ortega-Murillo regime used to exclude opposition candidates and parties and harass and jail political opponents.<b></b></li>
<li><b>Karen Vanessa Chavarria Morales</b>, current judge in the ninth district in Managua, for abusing her authority and subverting legal processes to act against political opponents of the Ortega-Murillo regime and disqualify opposition candidates from the November 2021 election.<b></b></li>
<li><b>Walmaro Antonio Gutierrez Mercado</b>, current member of the Nicaraguan National Assembly, <b>Carlos Wilfredo Navarro Moreira</b>, current member of the Nicaraguan National Assembly, and <b>Gustavo Eduardo Porras Cortes</b>, current President of the Nicaraguan National Assembly for giving the Ortega-Murillo regime the tools to conduct its brazen assault on democracy by stacking the CSE with FSLN members loyal to Ortega.<b></b></li>
<li><b>Maria Haydee Osuna Ruiz, </b>current member of the Nicaraguan National Assembly, for conspiring with the Ortega-Murillo regime to subvert the November 2021 Nicaraguan national elections by signing a spurious complaint that served as pretext for the government to disqualify the last remaining legitimate opposition party and hound its leader into exile.<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p>We will continue to use all tools at our disposal to promote accountability for corruption and other attacks on the security, stability, and democratic aspirations of the people of Central America.  We are standing with the people of Nicaragua as they strive to restore democratic institutions, select their leaders in free and fair elections, and create the futures they desire for themselves and their families.</p>
