<p>The United States is the world’s single largest financial supporter of CWD.

<p>Our assistance – that of the United States government and our global partners – is crucial to building a more safe, secure, and prosperous world.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>We are following the extremely disturbing accounts of large numbers of people killed earlier this week in the village of Mourah in the Mopti region of central Mali. We offer our condolences to the families of all civilians who died.</p>
<p>We are concerned that many reports suggest that the perpetrators were unaccountable forces from the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group. Other reports claim the Malian Armed Forces (FAMa) had targeted elements of known violent extremist groups. These conflicting reports illustrate the urgent need for the Malian transition authorities to give impartial investigators free, unfettered, and safe access to the area where these tragic events unfolded.</p>
<p>Immediate access to eyewitnesses and to the many individuals who are said to be in government custody is essential set the record straight. We call on Mali’s transition government to grant access to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) to conduct a rigorous investigation as mandated by the UN Security Council. Failure to provide a thorough and credible accounting of the facts and accountability will only serve to sow divisions in Malian society, undermine the credibility, legitimacy, and reputation of the FAMa, drive communities into the hands of violent extremist groups, and create conditions for more violence.</p>

We call on Mali’s transition government to grant access to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) to conduct a rigorous investigation as mandated by the UN Security Council. Failure to provide a thorough and credible accounting of the facts and accountability will only serve to sow divisions in Malian society, undermine the credibility, legitimacy, and reputation of the FAMa, drive communities into the hands of violent extremist groups, and create conditions for more violence.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And joining me now is the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.  Mr. Secretary, welcome back to Meet the Press.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good morning, Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Let me start with the news of the Russians pulling back from Kyiv, focusing, it appears now, on the East where they’ve had a bit more military success.  Are we in a new phase in this war?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, Chuck, we may be.  I think this is evidence that Russia’s original plans to take over the whole country, including Kyiv, have been dealt a devastating setback.  They are regrouping.  They may be focusing on the East.  But let’s keep in mind they still have the ability to wreak massive death and destruction, including in places like Kyiv, with airpower and missiles.  And at the same time, they may be regrouping; they may be recalibrating.  We’re focused on what they’re doing, not what they’re saying.  And if it’s a refocus on the East, there’s still a tremendous amount that’s going to be ahead of us.  As President Biden said recently, this could go on for some time, and the question is how much death and destruction Russia wreaks in the meantime.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Are we going to help Ukraine reinforce sort of now the Central and Western part of the country, reinforce Kyiv so that essentially the Russians don’t even think about coming back?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Chuck, we’re doing that every single day.  Just over the course of this administration we’ve provided more than $2.3 billion in security assistance – in the last month alone, $1.6 billion – the very kinds of things that have made the Ukrainians incredibly effective in dealing with this Russian onslaught, in pushing it back, in setting it back.  And look, what we’ve already seen is a strategic setback and maybe even defeat for Russia.</p>
<p>Russia had three goals going into this: to subjugate Ukraine to its will, to deny its sovereignty and its independence; to assert Russian power; and to divide the West, divide the alliance.  And on all three fronts, it’s failed.  Ukraine is now more united.  It’s – a sovereign, independent Ukraine is going to be there a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene.  Russian power has actually been vastly diminished.  The military has greatly underperformed.  Its economy is reeling.  And of course, NATO, the West, are more united than in any time in recent memory.  So on those grounds alone, we’ve already seen a dramatic setback for Russia.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  You have just described a situation – and Richard Engel was telling me that there are people in Ukraine going, hey, we’ve got Putin in as weak of a spot as we’ve had him in a long time.  This is actually not the time to suddenly negotiate a way for him to get out of this.  So – and nobody wants to see more war.  At the same time, nobody – I don’t think a lot of people, including the President of the United States, wants to see Putin remain in power after this.  So can we really end this with giving Putin some sort of gain in the Donbas?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Chuck, the – how this war ends is up to two things.  It’s up to the Ukrainian people and their elected representatives, including President Zelenskyy.  We’ll support whatever they want to do in terms of how this war comes to an end.  And as to Mr. Putin’s future, that’s up to the Russian people.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  But do you acknowledge he’s in a weak moment?  I mean, is this a moment – is this a moment that we’re – if he’s – if we – if we let him lie and he wreaks havoc again, are we going to regret not taking advantage of this moment?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Again, it’s up to, in the first instance, Ukrainians when it comes to what’s going on in Ukraine, and Russians when it comes to what’s going on in Russia.  And here’s the thing:  Even though he’s been set back, even though I believe this is already a strategic defeat for Vladimir Putin, the death and destruction that he is wreaking every single day in Ukraine, the images that are on our TVs and on social media every single day are terrible.  And so there’s also a strong interest in bringing those to an end.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I want to ask about the Zelenskyy – potential Zelenskyy-Putin face-to-face in Turkey.  How realistic is that?  And does President Zelenskyy – does he have the ability to negotiate sanctions relief with Putin?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  So how realistic it is, very hard to say.  The Ukrainians have sought a direct engagement with President Putin for President Zelenskyy.  President Putin has rejected that repeatedly.  We’ll see if he goes forward with anything.  But again, our focus is on making sure that we’re doing everything possible to strengthen Ukraine’s hand at the negotiating table, including with a potential meeting between President Zelenskyy and President Putin.  And that’s exactly what we’re doing.  We’ve been supporting Ukraine.  We’ve been imposing extraordinary pressure on Russia.  We’ve been solidifying our own alliance.  All of that goes to strengthening Ukraine’s hand when it comes to any negotiations with Russia.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Again, I want to go back to – what is – can Zelenskyy negotiate sanctions relief at all here or not?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  The entire international community that’s come together to impose those sanctions on Russia will be looking to see what Ukraine is doing and what it wants to do.  And if it concludes that it can bring this war to an end, stop the death and destruction, and continue to assert its independence and its sovereignty, and ultimately that requires the lifting of sanctions, of course we’re going to look at that.  The purpose of the sanctions, Chuck, is not to be there indefinitely.  It’s to change Russia’s conduct.  And if, as a result of negotiations, the sanctions, the pressure, the support for Ukraine, we achieve just that, then at some point the sanctions will go away.  But that is profoundly up to Russia and what it does going forward.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  The restrengthening of the ruble – and I understand there’s some market manipulation there to do that – but there clearly is some signs that the ruble is strengthened. Obviously, Europe – there are plenty of European countries that continue to pay Russia for oil and gas.  Is there more that can be done to tighten – to tighten these sanctions again?  Because it looks like he’s found some ways around them.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, Chuck, first, virtually all of the forecasts show Russia’s economy contracting by 10 percent this year.  That is dramatic, especially at a time when other economies, including our own, are rebounding dramatically.  Second, when it comes to the ruble, it’s more than a little manipulation, it’s a lot of manipulation.  People are being prevented from unloading rubles.  That’s artificially propping up the value.  That’s not sustainable.  So I think you’re going to see that change.  We’ve seen the most extraordinary exodus of virtually every leading business from around the world leaving Russia – everything from McDonald’s to Toyota.  And that’s having not just an immediate impact, but a long-term impact.</p>
<p>And then the export controls that we’ve imposed on Russia, denying it the technology it needs to modernize industry after industry, that’s going to have an increasing bite.  Having said that, to your point, we’re working every single day with partners and allies around the world to make sure that we’re tightening the sanctions, closing any loopholes, adding new ones.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Whose side is time on here?  If this is a six – if this is going to drag out another six months, can Ukraine’s military hold up?  Can the European alliance hold up?  Can Putin survive economically?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Chuck, when it comes to the fundamentals, which is to say Putin’s objective in subjugating Ukraine to his will, on denying, taking away its sovereignty and independence, time is certainly not on Vladimir Putin’s side because, as I said, a sovereign, independent Ukraine has demonstrated it’s going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene.  The real question, though, again, is what happens in the meantime.  If this goes on, how much death, how much destruction is there?  And that is terrible.</p>
<p>So we have a strong interest, the Ukrainians have a strong interest, in ending that.  We’re all working toward that.  The way to do that is to give Ukraine the strongest possible hand, to put as much pressure as we possibly can on Russia while we’re strengthening our own defenses.  That’s exactly what we’ve been doing.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary Antony Blinken, appreciate you coming on and sharing the administration’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks, Chuck.  Good to be with you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Joining me now is U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Thank you so much for joining me this morning.  So I want to start with those horrific images and reports from Bucha.  What is your reaction?  And do you see evidence here of crimes against humanity?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Dana, you can’t help but see these images as a punch to the gut.  And look, we’ve said before Russia’s aggression that we thought it was likely that they would commit atrocities.  Since the aggression, we’ve come out and said that we believe that Russian forces have committed war crimes and we’ve been working to document that, to provide the information that we have to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together, and there needs to be accountability for it.</p>
<p>But I think the most important thing is we can’t become numb to this.  We can’t normalize this.  This is the reality of what’s going on every single day as long as Russia’s brutality against Ukraine continues.  That’s why it needs to come to an end.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And the Ukrainian foreign minister said Russia aims to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can.  Beyond war crimes, do you see this as genocide?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Look, we will look hard and document everything that we see, put it all together, make sure that the relevant institutions and organizations that are looking at this – including the State Department – have everything they need to assess exactly what took place in Ukraine, who’s responsible, and what it amounts to.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Let’s talk about the punishment here.  The EU is already saying it will impose new, even harsher sanctions over this.  What about the U.S.?  Would the U.S. impose more sanctions, for example, on Russian oil, cracking down on all Russian banks, banning energy payments from the SWIFT banking system?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Dana, we’re doing this every single day.  We’re tightening the existing sanctions.  We’re adding new ones.  We’re doing it in full coordination with Europeans and other partners around the world.  And one of the results is that the Russian economy is reeling.  There are forecasts by most of the major forecasters that its economy is going to contract by 10 percent this year, and that’s in stark contrast to economies like our own, which are growing rapidly.  We’re seeing an exodus of every major company from Russia.  And over the long term, the export controls that we’ve imposed means that they will not have the technology they need to modernize key aspects of their economy and their future.</p>
<p>So these sanctions are having a big bite now, they’re going to have a big bite going forward as long as this lasts, and we are every single day making sure that they’re not only tightened, but increased.  We announced additional sanctions just a couple of days ago.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  They still have a lifeline, particularly when it comes to their energy sector.  Is that something that the U.S. is considering along with its Western allies?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We’re in constant conversation with allies and partners about the most effective ways to tighten, to strengthen the sanctions, and at the same time, we’re very focused on making sure that Europe has the energy it needs not only to get through this year and this winter, which it has, but next year as well.  But the other thing, Dana, is this:  If you step back and look at this, this has already been a dramatic strategic setback for Russia and, I would say, a strategic defeat.</p>
<p>They had three aims going into this.  One was to subjugate Ukraine to Russia’s will, to take away its sovereignty and independence.  The second was to assert Russian power.  The third was to divide the West and NATO.  On all three fronts, it’s already lost.  Ukraine, its sovereignty and independence, is going to be there a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is going to be on the scene.  The Russian military has dramatically underperformed.  Its economy is reeling.  And the West, NATO, are more united than any time I can remember.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Let me ask you about that military statement that you just made for a minute because the new intelligence that is out there says that they are shifting specifically to the eastern part of Ukraine militarily.  And President Zelenskyy actually said that the Russians are pulling back from Kyiv.  We’ve actually seen that now.  You’ve said it’s what they do, not what they say.  We saw that.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  What does that tell you?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  So we are seeing that.  It’s, I think, too early to say what that actually means because they could be regrouping and restocking and replenishing and then coming back to Kyiv.  It’s also very possible that what we’re seeing is what it seems to be, which is a focus to the East and the South.  But Dana, even there, if that’s what they’re doing, then I think that the Ukrainians have already demonstrated that unless they’re able to move every single Ukrainian out of whatever piece of territory they’re trying to hold, it’s not going to last because the will of the Ukrainian people is clear:  They will not be subjected to a Russian occupation whether that’s in and around Kyiv or whether that’s in the East and the South.</p>
<p>But here is the problem:  In the meantime, the terrible death and destruction that you started with is going to continue.  And that’s why it is so urgent that Russia end this war of aggression and we do everything that we can to support the Ukrainians, to put pressure on Russia, to strengthen our own defenses.  All of that is going to strengthen Ukraine’s hand at the negotiating table and hopefully bring this to a quicker end.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  There are reports that Soviet-era tanks will be transferred to Ukraine.  Can you tell me about the U.S. role in facilitating that?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Dana, I can’t get into specific weapon systems.  What I can say is this:  First, we have provided, just over the course of this administration, $2.3 billion in security assistance of one kind or another to Ukraine, just $1.6 billion in the last month alone.  That includes many different weapon systems.  And let me give you one example of this:  Between the United States and our allies and partners, for every Russian tank, there are or will soon be in Ukraine more than 10 anti-tank systems for every Russian tank.</p>
<p>So across the board, what we’re trying to do is to make sure that Ukrainians have the systems that they need, that they can use, and they can use right away.  And that’s what’s been happening.  It’s been incredibly effective because of the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian forces.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So what you just described sounds like the U.S. facilitating those tanks going in.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We are working with countries around the world to facilitate the movement of the systems that the Ukrainians can actually use into Ukraine one way or another.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  This week Ukraine floated the idea of taking a Switzerland-like position of neutrality in Europe as part of a peace deal with Russia, but only if Western nations provide security guarantees if Ukraine is attacked.  Would the U.S. help provide those security guarantees?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  So Dana, first, all of this is up to the Ukrainians, which is to say that if they negotiate something that meets their needs, that preserves their sovereignty, their independence, we will back it.  And we’re not going to be less Ukrainian than Ukrainians.  We’re not going to be more Ukrainian than Ukrainians.  So first and foremost, it’s up to them, to their elected representatives, to President Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>When it comes to the future, we and allies and partners are going to want to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that this can’t happen again and that Ukraine has the means to defend itself, to deter further Russian aggression.  So we will look at anything that we can do to back up that kind of outcome.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Sounds like that’s a yes because this is coming from the Ukrainians, as you know.  But they &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  No, I’m not going to get – yeah, I’m not going to get ahead of any details of what might come into some kind of agreement.  But we’re going to want to make sure that we do what we can to help Ukraine defend itself going forward, to deter future Russian aggression.  There are many things that could go into that, but I’m not going to get ahead of them.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Before I let you go, the Biden administration announced this week that you will lift a Trump-era pandemic restriction called Title 42, which restricted immigration at the Southern border.  It comes as your administration says there could be up to 18,000 apprehensions of undocumented migrants per day.  Does the administration see an influx of migrants as a problem, and can you guarantee that they will be treated humanely?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, Dana, first, when it comes to Title 42, all along we’ve been following the science.  That’s what this is about.  So when the CDC and others conclude that the science doesn’t warrant that, as is now happening, then we’ll take action.</p>
<p>Here’s my focus and the Vice President’s focus as well:  We’re focused on making sure that people throughout our hemisphere have opportunities at home going forward so they’re not faced with this really hard choice of leaving everything behind and trying to come to the United States.  So building that kind of opportunity, creating what one of my colleagues has called a “right to remain,” is our focus.</p>
<p>In the nearer term, the focus I have is trying to make sure that transit countries in particular take steps to make sure that it – that folks who might come or try to come to the United States through their countries can’t do that.  So that’s what I’m focused on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, thank you so much for your time.  I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks.  Great to be with you.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Let’s talk about the punishment here.  The EU is already saying it will impose new, even harsher sanctions over this.  What about the U.S.?  Would the U.S. impose more sanctions, for example, on Russian oil, cracking down on all Russian banks, banning energy payments from the SWIFT banking system?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Dana, we’re doing this every single day.  We’re tightening the existing sanctions.  We’re adding new ones.  We’re doing it in full coordination with Europeans and other partners around the world.  And one of the results is that the Russian economy is reeling.  There are forecasts by most of the major forecasters that its economy is going to contract by 10 percent this year, and that’s in stark contrast to economies like our own, which are growing rapidly.  We’re seeing an exodus of every major company from Russia.  And over the long term, the export controls that we’ve imposed means that they will not have the technology they need to modernize key aspects of their economy and their future.</p>
<p>So these sanctions are having a big bite now, they’re going to have a big bite going forward as long as this lasts, and we are every single day making sure that they’re not only tightened, but increased.  We announced additional sanctions just a couple of days ago.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  They still have a lifeline, particularly when it comes to their energy sector.  Is that something that the U.S. is considering along with its Western allies?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We’re in constant conversation with allies and partners about the most effective ways to tighten, to strengthen the sanctions, and at the same time, we’re very focused on making sure that Europe has the energy it needs not only to get through this year and this winter, which it has, but next year as well.  But the other thing, Dana, is this:  If you step back and look at this, this has already been a dramatic strategic setback for Russia and, I would say, a strategic defeat.</p>
<p>They had three aims going into this.  One was to subjugate Ukraine to Russia’s will, to take away its sovereignty and independence.  The second was to assert Russian power.  The third was to divide the West and NATO.  On all three fronts, it’s already lost.  Ukraine, its sovereignty and independence, is going to be there a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is going to be on the scene.  The Russian military has dramatically underperformed.  Its economy is reeling.  And the West, NATO, are more united than any time I can remember.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Let me ask you about that military statement that you just made for a minute because the new intelligence that is out there says that they are shifting specifically to the eastern part of Ukraine militarily.  And President Zelenskyy actually said that the Russians are pulling back from Kyiv.  We’ve actually seen that now.  You’ve said it’s what they do, not what they say.  We saw that.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  What does that tell you?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  So we are seeing that.  It’s, I think, too early to say what that actually means because they could be regrouping and restocking and replenishing and then coming back to Kyiv.  It’s also very possible that what we’re seeing is what it seems to be, which is a focus to the East and the South.  But Dana, even there, if that’s what they’re doing, then I think that the Ukrainians have already demonstrated that unless they’re able to move every single Ukrainian out of whatever piece of territory they’re trying to hold, it’s not going to last because the will of the Ukrainian people is clear:  They will not be subjected to a Russian occupation whether that’s in and around Kyiv or whether that’s in the East and the South.</p>
<p>But here is the problem:  In the meantime, the terrible death and destruction that you started with is going to continue.  And that’s why it is so urgent that Russia end this war of aggression and we do everything that we can to support the Ukrainians, to put pressure on Russia, to strengthen our own defenses.  All of that is going to strengthen Ukraine’s hand at the negotiating table and hopefully bring this to a quicker end.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  There are reports that Soviet-era tanks will be transferred to Ukraine.  Can you tell me about the U.S. role in facilitating that?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Dana, I can’t get into specific weapon systems.  What I can say is this:  First, we have provided, just over the course of this administration, $2.3 billion in security assistance of one kind or another to Ukraine, just $1.6 billion in the last month alone.  That includes many different weapon systems.  And let me give you one example of this:  Between the United States and our allies and partners, for every Russian tank, there are or will soon be in Ukraine more than 10 anti-tank systems for every Russian tank.</p>
<p>So across the board, what we’re trying to do is to make sure that Ukrainians have the systems that they need, that they can use, and they can use right away.  And that’s what’s been happening.  It’s been incredibly effective because of the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian forces.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So what you just described sounds like the U.S. facilitating those tanks going in.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We are working with countries around the world to facilitate the movement of the systems that the Ukrainians can actually use into Ukraine one way or another.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  This week Ukraine floated the idea of taking a Switzerland-like position of neutrality in Europe as part of a peace deal with Russia, but only if Western nations provide security guarantees if Ukraine is attacked.  Would the U.S. help provide those security guarantees?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  So Dana, first, all of this is up to the Ukrainians, which is to say that if they negotiate something that meets their needs, that preserves their sovereignty, their independence, we will back it.  And we’re not going to be less Ukrainian than Ukrainians.  We’re not going to be more Ukrainian than Ukrainians.  So first and foremost, it’s up to them, to their elected representatives, to President Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>When it comes to the future, we and allies and partners are going to want to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that this can’t happen again and that Ukraine has the means to defend itself, to deter further Russian aggression.  So we will look at anything that we can do to back up that kind of outcome.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Sounds like that’s a yes because this is coming from the Ukrainians, as you know.  But they &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  No, I’m not going to get – yeah, I’m not going to get ahead of any details of what might come into some kind of agreement.  But we’re going to want to make sure that we do what we can to help Ukraine defend itself going forward, to deter future Russian aggression.  There are many things that could go into that, but I’m not going to get ahead of them.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Before I let you go, the Biden administration announced this week that you will lift a Trump-era pandemic restriction called Title 42, which restricted immigration at the Southern border.  It comes as your administration says there could be up to 18,000 apprehensions of undocumented migrants per day.  Does the administration see an influx of migrants as a problem, and can you guarantee that they will be treated humanely?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, Dana, first, when it comes to Title 42, all along we’ve been following the science.  That’s what this is about.  So when the CDC and others conclude that the science doesn’t warrant that, as is now happening, then we’ll take action.</p>
<p>Here’s my focus and the Vice President’s focus as well:  We’re focused on making sure that people throughout our hemisphere have opportunities at home going forward so they’re not faced with this really hard choice of leaving everything behind and trying to come to the United States.  So building that kind of opportunity, creating what one of my colleagues has called a “right to remain,” is our focus.</p>
<p>In the nearer term, the focus I have is trying to make sure that transit countries in particular take steps to make sure that it – that folks who might come or try to come to the United States through their countries can’t do that.  So that’s what I’m focused on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, thank you so much for your time.  I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks.  Great to be with you.</p>
