					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Tallinn, Estonia</p>
<p>Swissotel</p>
<p><strong>MR ROAROFF:</strong>  Thank you for your patience.  It’s been a busy but wonderful morning welcoming Secretary Blinken to Tallinn.</p>
<p>Just a couple quick remarks of introduction and thanks, and then we’ll open it up for questions after some comments by the Secretary.  I just wanted to start by saying: Secretary Blinken, thank you for making this trilateral visit.  We know that you and your team, this is the last in a long trip – six or seven countries, we’ll call it seven so far with your foray into Ukraine with the foreign minister.  That was great.  So thank you for coming and reassuring our Estonian allies.</p>
<p>I think you know, and the foreign minister gave you an article, that this is the first bilateral trip of a Secretary of State to Estonia since 1991.  Do read that article; it is interesting.  That trip took place in September 1991, a month after the coup attempt when hardliners tried to overthrow Gorbachev in Moscow.  The message that Secretary Baker heard at that time from Estonia, from the Baltics, was:  The hardliners will come back, please help us; they’re going to come back and try to snuff out your independence.  So 30 years later, the region still faces a Russian threat.</p>
<p>Today, everybody in front of you is working hard with our Estonian partners to support Ukraine.  The brutal attack on Ukraine hits very close to a lot of us here.  We are working on security assistance.  We’re working on isolating Russia in traditional organizations.  We all have our heart in it, and we’re going to do our utmost to support Ukraine.</p>
<p>Finally, I’m just so proud to introduce you to the staff of Embassy Tallinn.  This is the best staff I have worked with in my 20 years in the State Department.  We’ve gone through COVID together, but we haven’t lost a step.  We have a number of policy victories we can point to, and we’ve also kept our people safe.</p>
<p>I would wrap it up just by saying we have not had an ambassador since 2018.  There is not one American in this room who has worked at this embassy who has worked under an ambassador.  This is a great tribute to our Estonian staff.  The fact that we are such a strong embassy, that we have not missed a beat, that we keep advancing policy forward is because of our Estonian colleagues, and we are forever grateful for them.</p>
<p>So with that, we welcome you to Estonia, and please, let me introduce you to the staff of Embassy Tallinn.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It is wonderful to see each and every one of you here today.  And let me say to the chargé, there’s another reason why this mission is performing so well, and that’s your leadership here.  I’m grateful for it, the partnership is grateful for it, and it’s, I think, important to be here at this particular time.</p>
<p>I was struck – I hadn’t realized that the last time a Secretary of State was here on a bilateral basis was Secretary Baker in 1991.  There’s something to me that’s very poignant about that, because I have tremendous reverence for Secretary Baker, someone I admire a great deal.  And the historic resonance, given what’s happening today, could not be more powerful.  So if even there’s any small way in which I can be following in his footsteps, with the extraordinary leadership he showed at that pivot point in history, that will be a good thing.</p>
<p>You know this because you’re living it every day – you’re living it with our Estonian friends, partners, allies, for the locally employed staff who are Estonian – you feel this.  You know what is at stake with this Russian aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p>We’re seeing the stakes on a very personal and individual level with the suffering of the Ukrainian people, the destruction that we’re seeing in Ukraine, the now more than 1.7 million people who had to flee the country for their safety, the hundreds of thousands more who are internally displaced, people living in besieged cities where they don’t have access to food and water, to medicine – nothing can come in, and they can’t get out safely.</p>
<p>So I know that you know and you feel the personal stakes and the lives that have been lost, the lives that have been changed.</p>
<p>I think friends here in Estonia and you also know why this is also about even more than Ukraine, and why it matters to the United States, why it matters to countries in Europe, why it matters to countries around the world.  And that’s because some of the foundational principles of the order that we tried to help establish over many years to keep peace and security, however imperfectly, that those principles are being challenged, that order is being challenged.  And if we allow that to stand with impunity, then we open a Pandora’s Box where this will not be the last conflict that we see – it will be the first of more to come.  So we have a profound interest in doing everything we can to end Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine, and it’s an interest that is felt very profoundly here.</p>
<p>The President asked me to come here now to Estonia, but also to Lithuania and to Latvia, our Baltic partners and allies, to make one thing absolutely clear, and that’s his absolute commitment and absolute commitment of the United States to making good on our commitments to our NATO Allies and partners, to making sure that we’re prepared, and we will defend every inch of NATO territory if it comes under attack.  And it’s important that our friends in Estonia know that, know that they can count on that, because I know how concerned people are, how nervous they are about the implications for them of what’s happening in Ukraine.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is this:  Every country should have its sovereignty respected.  Every country deserves to be able to make its own choices about its future, policies, with whom it will associate.  And that’s what’s at stake when it comes to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the fact that even as you’ve been grappling with this, even as you’ve been grappling with COVID – which I want to come back to – you’ve done remarkable work to continue to build, to strengthen the relationship between the United States and Estonia.  There are a couple of people that I just want to single out very quickly for the great work that they’ve done and they’ve led.  I don’t know if they’re actually here in the room today, but is Megan Naylor here anywhere?  Yep, Megan.</p>
<p>Thank you for five months of intensive diplomacy on something that people don’t fully necessarily grasp but that is of huge importance, and that’s the global minimum tax, and working with our Estonian partners to secure their support for that.  That’s going to have a powerful effect going forward in making sure we don’t have a race to the bottom around the world in search of low tax rates – giving countries a real resource base to actually provide for their people.  It’s one of the most important achievements I think we’ve had over the last year, and I thank you for your part in making it real.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>I know we have colleagues here from the Secret Service, from the FBI, who’ve done such incredible work with our Estonian partners on cyber security.  Again, one of the great challenges that we face – we have in Estonia one of the strongest partners anywhere in the world because of their remarkable facility with all things cyber, and I’m really grateful to our colleagues from the Secret Service, the FBI, for the great work they’ve done in working with our Estonian partners.</p>
<p>We’ve seen in this crisis new levels of collaboration and coordination.  To folks who are here with the defense attaché’s office, the Office of Defense Cooperation, what you’ve done working with the Estonians to facilitate the transfer of Javelins and other defense equipment to our Ukrainian friends has made a huge difference.  And we’re grateful for that.</p>
<p>And then to colleagues who are here from the consular section, going the extra mile, including working to support American citizens in Russia after the close of our consular section in Moscow.<a id="post-322053-footnote-ref-1" href="#post-322053-footnote-1"></a></p>
<p>All of these things are making a huge difference and they’re making a big difference in people’s lives.</p>
<p>As the chargé said, I know that here, as in embassies around the world, you’ve had to do your work over the last two years and deal with COVID at the same time.  That’s had a big impact on the professional part of your lives, and I know for many it’s had an impact on the personal part of your lives.  Some getting sick, some losing loved ones, but through all of this you kept going with tremendous resilience, with tremendous camaraderie, looking out for each other.  And I especially want to thank the management and MED units here for keeping the embassy safe and getting us through COVID.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to mention a couple of people by name.  And, again, I’m not sure if they’re here with us today but let me just say the locally employed staff here, as in every embassy, are the lifeblood of this mission, of this institution.  We can’t do what we do without you, without that partnership.  I’m so grateful for it, and I want to mention Taimi Veedla.  Is Taimi here?  Not here.  Well, LE Staff of the Year, and so I just wanted to recognize that.</p>
<p>And let me just mention a couple of other people as well.  Craig Shaffer, Tina Mills, Tõnu Jää – are any of you here today?  Thank you, thank you, thank you for everything you’ve done to keep people connected, for the exceptional IT services that you’ve helped provide.  I know there was a telephone upgrade for the entire mission.  Having had some telephone issues of my own back home, I know how challenging that is.  Thanks for getting that done.</p>
<p>And then finally to the community liaison officer Melissa Padgett – Melissa, are you here?  Melissa, thank you most of all for everything you’ve done to just keep people’s spirits high.  That makes all the difference in the world, especially in a challenging time, whether it’s COVID, whether it’s the challenge we’re dealing now with Ukraine.  I understand, and I’m actually extremely jealous that I’m not around to benefit from that, so I may have to come back – sauna trips to Estonian bogs – that sounds very good – cross country skiing, obviously great.  I’m not quite sure what to make of this – a ghost tour of old Tallinn.  That sounds like something I’d want to try to do, sounds like ghost stories in the old city.  Great.  All right, I’m coming back for that.</p>
<p>Finally, let me end with this.  As you all know better than anyone, we are in a particularly special year in this relationship, about to celebrate 100 years of diplomatic relations.  And I know you’ve got 100 days to 100 years, with events planned to lead up to that.  That, in and of itself, is a remarkable story.  It’s a story of many ups and downs in history, particularly for Estonia, but also something incredibly constant, and that is the relationship itself and our commitment to stick with our Ukrainian partners through thick and thin.  And it’s no more vital than it is today, so I’m grateful for that.</p>
<p>Now, finally, there is someone who has served here for 30 years, since we reestablished this mission.  Evelyn Laasner, are you here?  (Applause.)  The very first employee when the embassy reopened, right there.  Thank you.  I was seeing applause over there.  Thank you.  Very first employee when the embassy reopened.  You’ve seen Estonia go from Soviet occupation to this incredibly flourishing democracy.  I understand that you’re retiring this year.  I didn’t want to let this day go by without saying thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.).</p>
<p>And finally, whether you are locally employed staff, whether you’re a Foreign Service officer, a civil servant, whether you’re a family member, because family members too are our frontline diplomats, and we know how much you do to build this relationship, how much you do representing your country, whether you’re from any of the other agencies that we’re privileged to work with, from the Defense Department, DHS, DOJ, AID – thank you, thank you, thank you for what you’re doing.  It makes a difference that many of our fellow citizens back home don’t necessarily see, but in ways big and small they’re actually going to feel in their lives.  I’m grateful to you.</p>
<p>And finally, to all of you who worked on putting this trip together on pretty short notice, I know how much goes into that, and all I can say is have a great wheels-up party.  (Laughter.)  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

<p>Now, finally, there is someone who has served here for 30 years, since we reestablished this mission.  Evelyn Laasner, are you here?  (Applause.)  The very first employee when the embassy reopened, right there.  Thank you.  I was seeing applause over there.  Thank you.  Very first employee when the embassy reopened.  You’ve seen Estonia go from Soviet occupation to this incredibly flourishing democracy.  I understand that you’re retiring this year.  I didn’t want to let this day go by without saying thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.).</p>
<p>And finally, whether you are locally employed staff, whether you’re a Foreign Service officer, a civil servant, whether you’re a family member, because family members too are our frontline diplomats, and we know how much you do to build this relationship, how much you do representing your country, whether you’re from any of the other agencies that we’re privileged to work with, from the Defense Department, DHS, DOJ, AID – thank you, thank you, thank you for what you’re doing.  It makes a difference that many of our fellow citizens back home don’t necessarily see, but in ways big and small they’re actually going to feel in their lives.  I’m grateful to you.</p>
<p>And finally, to all of you who worked on putting this trip together on pretty short notice, I know how much goes into that, and all I can say is have a great wheels-up party.  (Laughter.)  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Wendy R. Sherman, Deputy Secretary of State</p>
<p>Casablanca, Morocco</p>
<p>What a perfect way to celebrate International Women’s Day—to be with all of you. In the first instance, I just want to applaud all of you for what you are doing.</p>
<p>It is such a pleasure to be here with such a fabulous, accomplished group of women in celebration of International Women’s Day.</p>
<p>I want to begin by congratulating the Association of Moroccan Women Entrepreneurs, and particularly your President—and pardon me, as I will undoubtedly mispronounce someone’s name—but thank you, Leila , very much, for organizing such a wonderful program today.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting Leila’s mother Farida, as she was introduced, as well, earlier today—and thank you for doing this program in English for me this evening, I appreciate it. I know how proud Farida is of this amazing event and all Leila’s work advancing women’s entrepreneurship here in Morocco. I told her that I always think of my mother on this day because this was her birthday. And she was a woman entrepreneur in real estate.</p>
<p>So it is a pleasure to share the stage with Morocco’s Minister of Solidarity, Social Integration, and Family. Aawatif , it is wonderful to be with you. As I said to you, I would love to have the title of Minister of Social Solidarity. What a wonderful thing to bring everybody together. So thank you, very much.</p>
<p>Thank you as well to Casablanca Regional Wali Said—now I’m going to not get this right—Ahmidouch, Head of the Casablanca-Settat Regional Council Maazouz Abdellatif. I know that Casablanca’s first woman mayor wasn’t able to join us, but I know she has given her support to today’s event, and we are grateful for everything she does every day to empower Moroccan women every.</p>
<p>I want to echo something that Secretary Tony Blinken said earlier today in Estonia—which is for all of us, on this International Women’s Day, I for one, and I’m sure all of you, are giving a thought to the women of Ukraine.</p>
<p>More than 1.7 million Ukrainians, mostly women and children, have fled the war that Vladimir Putin unleashed on their country—often leaving their husbands behind to fight. Ukrainian women are giving birth in subway stations turned bomb shelters. They are caring for children with cancer in the basements of hospitals as they hide from missiles. They are taking up arms alongside Ukraine’s men to fight for their democracy and defend their homeland. The women of Ukraine, like all of you, embody the strength, resilience, and dauntless courage of women everywhere—and our hearts are with them today and every day.</p>
<p>International Women’s Day provides us with an annual opportunity to recognize the achievements of women and girls around the world—like all of you amazing entrepreneurs that are here today.</p>
<p>And it also gives us a chance to recommit to advancing the rights of women and girls—in our own countries, and around the world.</p>
<p>We have decades of evidence that when women and girls can participate fully and equally in education, in business, in government, in civil society—in every sphere of public life—then countries are more secure, more peaceful, and more prosperous.</p>
<p>When women are fully able to participate in their societies, we see stronger and more inclusive economic growth—the kind of growth that lifts up poor families and middle-class families alike. We see improvements in security, justice, and the rule of law.</p>
<p>And when women are at the table where decisions are made, we even see improvements in global peace and stability. When women participate in peace negotiations, the resulting peace deals are 35 percent more likely to last 15 years or longer. When the number of women in a national legislature increases by just five percent, that nation also becomes five times more likely to resort to peace to resolve international disputes.</p>
<p>That is why the United States is committed to advancing the rights of women and girls around the world, and to integrating gender equity and equality across all our foreign and domestic policy. We simply cannot build the world we want to see without the full and equal participation, rights, and dignity of women and girls everywhere.</p>
<p>Supporting women entrepreneurs is one of the best tools we have for advancing equality for women and girls. That’s because entrepreneurship equals financial empowerment and financial freedom. When women can start and grow their own businesses, they are less likely to be financially dependent on others in their lives—and that has all kinds of secondary effects.</p>
<p>Financial autonomy for women means less poverty for women and families. It means women have more power to influence decisions in their communities. It means greater recognition across society for women’s capabilities, our leadership, and our humanity.</p>
<p>Morocco has made important strides in recent decades to support women’s rights. In 2004, Morocco’s new family code made significant reforms to advance equality for women and girls. Thanks to the tireless work of women’s rights activists across Morocco, the 2011 revision to the Moroccan constitution recognized that men and women enjoy equal rights. And in 2018, Morocco adopted legislation criminalizing violence against women.</p>
<p>Despite this progress, however, the percentage of Moroccan women in the labor force remains quite low, one of the lowest in the world—and it’s actually lower than it was two decades ago.</p>
<p>Morocco’s New Development Model—a priority of King Mohammed VI—has put increasing women’s participation in the economy at the forefront of Morocco’s strategy for economic growth. The United States wants to support Morocco to reach its goal of increasing women’s participation in the workforce to 45 percent in 2035, up from 22 percent today. We are proud to be a partner to Morocco and Moroccan women in advancing women’s economic opportunity and supporting women entrepreneurs, including through the State Department’s POWER program.</p>
<p>POWER convenes women business leaders and entrepreneurs, in the United States and around the world, to help women develop their professional networks—as you all are doing here today—identify market opportunities, and break down barriers that hold women back economically. I am very glad that the State Department, led by our CDA David Greene, who is here with us today, and our mission here in Morocco were able to leverage the POWER program to support today’s event.</p>
<p>In spite of the progress we’ve made in advancing women’s rights—here in Morocco, at home in the United States, and elsewhere around the world—we have to be humble and acknowledge that there is more work to do. Not a single country has achieved gender equality—including the United States.</p>
<p>As you were told, I am the first woman to serve as Deputy Secretary of State. That took until 2021. I was the first woman to serve as the Undersecretary for Political Affairs. That took until 2011. It is, frankly, crazy that it took so long—but it did.</p>
<p>Now, there are some benefits to having this silver hair that I have. And one of the benefits is that I don’t have to worry quite so much about what people think about me. So if I walk into a meeting or a briefing and I’m the only woman in the room, which happens rather frequently, whether I’m visiting one of our embassies or meeting with a foreign delegation, I say something about it. Sometimes people take it on board, sometimes they dismiss it, often they’re sort of uncomfortable—but I always say something. Because if I don’t, who will?</p>
<p>When I served under President Obama, the top three positions on the National Security Council were all held by women. But men’s voices were still heard differently. In so many meetings, we’d go around the table, and a man would repeat a point one of the women had already made—without acknowledging it. You all have probably had that experience occasionally.</p>
<p>So my colleagues and I started speaking up when this happened. We’d say things like, “I’m so glad you agree with what Lisa just said.”</p>
<p>Now, I don’t know if the men always noticed. But it felt good to have each other’s back. We learned, in other words, that we women were all better off if we stuck together and reinforced and supported each other.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I’ve benefited from having women mentors and colleagues who I could turn to if I needed to gut-check my reaction to something, to talk through a strategy, or sometimes just to vent, just to complain. Building a network of supportive colleagues is especially helpful when you’re in the minority in your field, in your organization, or in your field of study.</p>
<p>And building your support system is key for preventing burnout. That’s what you all are doing today. Helping each other out. Because let’s face it—it’s often just really hard to be the first, or one of the first, to do what you’re doing. If you can’t look around and see people who look like you in similar positions, it may be hard to imagine how you can get there yourself.</p>
<p>That’s why events like this one today are so important. By coming together as a community, you’re forging the kinds of networks, partnerships, and friendships that will help you achieve your goals and provide an example to younger women who wonder if they can do what you have already done.</p>
<p>We need each other to get through the hard times—to cheer each other’s accomplishments in the good times—and to make connections, suggest resources, and even just to offer a sympathetic ear during all the times in between.</p>
<p>The future is really bright for women entrepreneurs here in Morocco and around the world. So my appeal to you today, very much what this organization is all about, is: don’t stop chasing your goals, your ambitions, your dreams, and your power as leaders. And keep supporting each other. Because we have to stick together.</p>
<p>Thank you again for having me, and happy International Women’s Day.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><em>The following is the text of a joint statement by the Governments of Morocco and the United States of America.</em></p>
<p><em>Begin text:</em></p>
<p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation, and Moroccan Expatriates, M. Nasser Bourita, and the Deputy Secretary of State of the United States of America, Ms. Wendy Sherman, held bilateral political consultations in Rabat today and co-chaired a session of the Morocco-U.S. Strategic Dialogue on Regional Political Issues.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Bourita and Deputy Secretary Sherman welcomed the celebration of International Women’s Day as a milestone in promoting and advancing women’s rights.  They underscored the need to advance efforts aiming at strengthening women’s rights and achieving equality.</p>
<p>The meeting was an opportunity to reiterate the commitment to the long-standing relations between Morocco and the United States that date to the Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1787.  They emphasized that the strategic bilateral partnership between Morocco and the United States is rooted in shared interests in regional peace, security, and prosperity.  They also discussed areas for future U.S.-Moroccan cooperation.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Bourita and Deputy Secretary Sherman highlighted King Mohammed VI’s leadership in advancing a far-reaching reform agenda.</p>
<p>They discussed the importance of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and building on the productive Morocco-U.S. dialogue on human rights held in September 2021, which serves as the main platform to discuss all human rights related issues.</p>
<p>The Minister and the Deputy Secretary expressed their intent to continue cooperation on issues of common interest such as regional peace and prosperity, and the development of Africa and regional security.  Deputy Secretary Sherman emphasized the crucial role played by the Kingdom of Morocco in maintaining regional security and stability as well as its contribution to peace and prosperity in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister and Deputy Secretary recalled the Joint Declaration of December 22, 2020, signed by Morocco, United States, and Israel.  The Deputy Secretary welcomed the continued deepening of relations between Morocco and Israel.  They discussed ways and means to boost cooperation between the three countries.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister and the Deputy Secretary expressed strong support for United Nations Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura in leading the political process for Western Sahara, under the auspices of the United Nations.  The Deputy Secretary noted that the United States continues to view Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as serious, credible, and realistic, and one potential approach to meet the aspirations of the people of the region.</p>

<p><em>The following is the text of a joint statement by the Governments of Morocco and the United States of America.</em></p>
<p><em>Begin text:</em></p>
<p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation, and Moroccan Expatriates, M. Nasser Bourita, and the Deputy Secretary of State of the United States of America, Ms. Wendy Sherman, held bilateral political consultations in Rabat today and co-chaired a session of the Morocco-U.S. Strategic Dialogue on Regional Political Issues.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Bourita and Deputy Secretary Sherman welcomed the celebration of International Women’s Day as a milestone in promoting and advancing women’s rights.  They underscored the need to advance efforts aiming at strengthening women’s rights and achieving equality.</p>
<p>The meeting was an opportunity to reiterate the commitment to the long-standing relations between Morocco and the United States that date to the Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1787.  They emphasized that the strategic bilateral partnership between Morocco and the United States is rooted in shared interests in regional peace, security, and prosperity.  They also discussed areas for future U.S.-Moroccan cooperation.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Bourita and Deputy Secretary Sherman highlighted King Mohammed VI’s leadership in advancing a far-reaching reform agenda.</p>
<p>They discussed the importance of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and building on the productive Morocco-U.S. dialogue on human rights held in September 2021, which serves as the main platform to discuss all human rights related issues.</p>
<p>The Minister and the Deputy Secretary expressed their intent to continue cooperation on issues of common interest such as regional peace and prosperity, and the development of Africa and regional security.  Deputy Secretary Sherman emphasized the crucial role played by the Kingdom of Morocco in maintaining regional security and stability as well as its contribution to peace and prosperity in the Middle East.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On International Women’s Day, the United States is proud to join the global community in celebrating the achievements and contributions of women and girls from around the world, while simultaneously recognizing the barriers they continue to face. The United States stands firm in its longstanding commitment to the advancement of gender equity and equality and the empowerment of women and girls, in all their diversity.</p>
<p>Today, the world is facing several significant challenges that disproportionately impact women and girls, including the climate crisis, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and humanitarian emergencies and conflict in Ukraine, Ethiopia, Yemen, and in so many other places, including the significant curtailment of the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The United States recognizes that in order to adequately address these pressing challenges, we must focus on the needs of women and girls, and ensure they are empowered participants in all sectors of life. That is why I am proud to preview that the President&#8217;s FY 2023 Budget will request approximately $2.6 billion for foreign assistance programs that promote gender equity and equality worldwide, more than doubling the amount requested for gender programs in the FY 2022 Budget. This includes a request for $200 million for the Gender Equity and Equality Action Fund. Additionally, the United States is taking several concrete steps to formalize and accelerate policy efforts to promote the rights of women and girls around the globe, including through the first-ever U.S. National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality. This strategy formalizes gender equity and equality as primary foreign policy and national security priorities for the United States.</p>
<p>In celebration of International Women’s Day and our time-honored commitment to advancing the status of women and girls, I am proud that today, the Department of State announced the awardees of the 2022 International Women of Courage (IWOC) Awards. I will host the 16th annual IWOC Awards in a virtual ceremony on Monday, March 14 on <a href="http://state.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://state.gov&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646840592931000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jG5YAbneZoi73YEsvNbOY">state.gov</a>. This annual award recognizes and celebrates women, in all their diversity, who have dedicated their lives to promoting human rights, gender equity and equality, peace, justice, the rule of law, and accountability – often at great personal risk or sacrifice. From promoting the rights of LGBTQI+ persons in Nepal, to preventing and responding to all forms of gender-based violence in Liberia, to being the first woman Foreign Minister of Libya, and so much more, the recipients of the 2022 IWOC Award truly exemplify what it means to be courageous.  Find more information about the 2022 IWOC Awardees at <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-states-international-women-of-courage-award/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjAzMDguNTQ1NjUxOTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZS5nb3Yvc2VjcmV0YXJ5LW9mLXN0YXRlcy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXdvbWVuLW9mLWNvdXJhZ2UtYXdhcmQvIn0.BH11VBugpQJbCaobcI79hZpuZfWg9o6ye73gc8JBcyw/s/1006560560/br/127693114289-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646840592931000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0lQTnYJITlBvZEnEVgje_i">https://www.state.gov/<wbr />secretary-of-states-<wbr />international-women-of-<wbr />courage-award/</a>.</p>
<p>The United States remains deeply committed to supporting women and girls’ economic security, preventing and responding to all forms of gender-based violence, increasing their access to health, education, justice, human rights and equality under the law, and humanitarian relief, advancing women’s political leadership and decision-making in all areas including addressing climate change and security challenges, developing science and technology, and promoting democracy. To our 2022 International Women of Courage and all the courageous women and girls around the world, I thank you for your strength, leadership, and efforts to make the world a more just, peaceful, and free place for us all.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Kaja Kallas, Estonian Prime Minister</p>
<p>Tallinn, Estonia</p>
<p>Stenbock House  </p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Dear guests, distinguished ladies and gentlemen of the press, we are very happy to welcome the Secretary of State of the United States of America here in Tallinn, in Estonia, in Stenbock House.  The Prime Minister of Estonia Kaja Kallas, and the Secretary of State of the United States of America Antony Blinken, will deliver statements and take two questions.  The press conference is held in English with simultaneous translation into Estonian.</p>
<p>First, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, please.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER KALLAS:</strong>  Thank you.  Dear Secretary Blinken, members of the press, it is my great pleasure to welcome you here in Tallinn.  I’ve been closely following your work and I admire it greatly.  I wish it could be under more pleasant circumstances, though.</p>
<p>Our discussion today focused on the sharply deteriorated security situation in Europe, but also the need to adopt a new reality, raising the cost of aggression to Russia and supporting Ukraine.  Putin’s war against the – against Ukraine is an act of military aggression against an independent and sovereign state that wants to fulfill its European dream.</p>
<p>We are standing here in the state elders room.  So the pictures you see around this room are of our state elders, the politicians that were running the country before the Soviet occupation.  It reminds us of how valuable independence and freedom is, and it also reminds us that we have a very aggressive neighbor that we have suffered under.</p>
<p>The (inaudible) war tactic is to terrorize civilians and put them to the front line of this war.  This is brutal and heartbreaking.  This tragedy demands first our continued and united support to Ukraine – political, humanitarian, economic, but also military.  Second, our focus must be on full isolation of Russia from the free world.  And third, we need to adapt to the new reality and also make changes in our own defense.</p>
<p>Ukraine fights bravely for its homeland.  What it needs urgently now is our military help.  And here the American commitment and help have been and are – continues to be crucial.  Estonia, together with the United States, was one of the first to give military support, even before the actual military attack happened on 24th of February.</p>
<p>We should stop the military machine of the aggressor.  The democratic world has stepped up against the war with speed, strength, and determination.  Our unity in action will help to tame the aggressor, but we need to be prepared for the worst, that the worst is still to come.  Hence Putin’s violence must be in correlation with the further sanctions and also isolation decisions.</p>
<p>First, we need to finalize and fully disclose SWIFT for Russia and Belarus.  Second, we have to restrict also cryptocurrencies.  This is equally important to close the loopholes.  We have also closed our air space, but we need to take a step forward and also close the sea ports for Russian vessels.  And we will keep finding new tools in our toolbox until Putin’s war machine has been paralyzed.</p>
<p>We are in this for the long haul.  We see already tremendous policy shifts vis-à-vis Russia across the European Union.  What we need next is also to have a strategic patience to keep these decisions in place.</p>
<p>Russia expects us to make a step back soon.  As Dmitry Medvedev explained to Putin in recent public meeting of the Russian security council, and I quote: “Sooner or later, they will get tired of their own initiative.  They will come to ask us about returning to discussions and negotiations regarding all the matters of strategic security,” end of quote.</p>
<p>So we will prove them wrong.  They will come to test us, and yes, we will have to resist.</p>
<p>The new security situation also demands rapid changes to European, including Estonian, defense.  Estonia has long spent over 2 percent of our GDP of our defense, and we continue to call others to do the same.  In January, my government made a decision to raise it even more.  This means that in 2023 our increased defense budget will be 2.44 percent of our GDP.</p>
<p>NATO needs to adapt quickly as well.  Decisions we have to make in the coming weeks and months need to include an upgrade strategy for defense in our region.  This means permanently strengthening our defense in air, on land, and at sea.</p>
<p>I would like to the thank the U.S. for your presence and for your quick decisions that led to increased footprint in the Baltic countries.  We have to keep on working together for the long-term decisions.  That is why I also ask today to establish a permanent and meaningful NATO’s forward defense in the Baltic region.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to thank you, Secretary Blinken, and the U.S. administration for your heavy work, including intense consultations that you have had with us and our other allies in building the unity and – within NATO.  Our unity and scale of our joint decisions prove the strength of our democracies.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Thank you.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, please.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good afternoon, everyone.  And Prime Minister, thank you so much – not just for the warm welcome today, but for the very good conversation.  I deeply appreciate your insights and admire your leadership.  So thank you for today.  And it was very good as well to be with my friend the foreign minister, and I want to send best wishes, of course, to the president as well.</p>
<p>It’s great to be in Tallinn as Secretary of State for the first time.  It’s meaningful to be here in particular on this hundredth anniversary year of our diplomatic relations.  But as the prime minister said, I also wish it were under different circumstances.</p>
<p>Together, over many months, as we saw the mounting likelihood of Russian aggression against Ukraine, we continued to hope for the best but we prepared for the worst.  And we have acted on all of those preparations, and I’ll come to that in a minute.</p>
<p>But over the past several days, at what is a critical moment for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the world, I’ve been engaged with allies and partners across the continent – in Brussels, with NATO, the European Union, G7 meetings; in Poland, where I visited a refugee welcome center and stood with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Ukrainian soil; in Moldova, a country seeking further integration into Europe; and finally, the three Baltic nations, Lithuania, Latvia, and today Estonia.</p>
<p>At every stop, I’ve emphasized the core values that bring our countries together – democracy, rule of law, a respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the international rules-based order that helps maintain peace and security everywhere.</p>
<p>And as I said yesterday in Lithuania and in Latvia, the people of Estonia – who lived through decades of Soviet occupation – understand in a profound way how wrong Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war in Ukraine is, how the world has to defend Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign, democratic country free to choose its own future.</p>
<p>The numbers of killed and wounded civilians in Ukraine continue to rise.  As of today, more than 1.7 million people have been forced to flee their own country.  More than 800,000 people have become internally displaced within Ukraine.  Many more people are trying to flee but can’t get out of besieged areas.  There have continued to be reports of shelling by Russian forces on agreed-upon humanitarian corridors.</p>
<p>We continue to call on Russia to allow for humanitarian access on the ground – both for supplies for people who have been cut off from food, water, medicine, and for humanitarian organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross that can negotiate true humanitarian corridors so that civilians can safely leave the country.</p>
<p>Estonia and the United States – together with our allies and partners – will continue to stand with Ukraine.  We’re increasing our security assistance to strengthen Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself.  Working with our humanitarian partners on the ground, we’re providing more aid to people who are still inside Ukraine as well as those who left.  And we’re raising the costs on the Kremlin and all who aid and abet its efforts in continuing this war of choice.</p>
<p>Our administration is also working with Congress to see to it that we do even more.  President Biden’s request for an additional $10 billion would enable us to surge security, humanitarian, and economic assistance where it’s needed.</p>
<p>For its part, Estonia has provided many kinds of assistance to Ukraine, including Javelin anti-tank missiles and Howitzers; food and medical aid to the front lines; a pledge to welcome more than 10,000 refugees if they choose to come here into Estonian homes, into Estonian communities.</p>
<p>And as everywhere we’ve been in the Baltics over this last day, we continue to see an outpouring of support for the Ukrainian people.  We continue to see the yellow and blue on homes and buildings.  And it’s a powerful message of solidarity.</p>
<p>And together, as the prime minister said, Estonia and the United States are bolstering our shared security and shared defense.  As President Biden said, we will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power.  Our commitment to Article 5 is ironclad.  An attack on one would be an attack on all.  We and our NATO Allies are prepared to meet any threat coming our direction, from wherever it comes.</p>
<p>NATO activated our defense plans for the eastern flank for the first time in its history in response to Russia’s aggression, giving the Supreme Allied Commander Europe the authority to deploy NATO response forces as needed.  Many Allies have increased their troop presence and contributed additional equipment and capabilities.</p>
<p>President Biden ordered the deployment of an additional 7,000 U.S. troops to Europe and moved forces already in Europe to NATO’s eastern flank.  We deployed F-35 strike fighter jets to the region; we’re augmenting NATO’s enhanced air policing mission.  And we’re working with Estonia and its Baltic neighbors on cybersecurity and energy security, which are also critically important to our shared security.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, the Baltics have formed a democratic wall that’s now standing against the tide of authoritarianism that Moscow is seeking to push further into Europe.  Estonia has become one of the most advanced digital societies in the world, with a strong free press, a business culture fueled by innovation, citizens empowered to do everything from voting to getting a passport online.</p>
<p>What a comparison to Moscow, which viciously targets journalists and floods the internet and airwaves with disinformation, both around the world and at home.</p>
<p>Many people in Russia have no idea what their government is doing right now in Ukraine.  They think they’re liberating Ukraine, not destroying it.  Moscow has banned Facebook and Twitter to make it easier to sell its lies.</p>
<p>One of the weak points of autocracies is that they rely on total control of information.  So we will continue in our efforts to counter Russian disinformation and expose the true costs of this war to the Russian people – both the profound costs to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, and the costs to Russian people themselves, which are mounting every single day.</p>
<p>The ruble has cratered.  Mastercard, Visa, Apple Pay have shut down.  Dozens of leading companies – from Nike to Coca-Cola, FedEx to Spotify, Netflix to Toyota – have exited the country.  President Putin is making Russia a pariah – destroying in the space of a week 30 years of international openness and opportunity.</p>
<p>The Russian people are already feeling the effects of this in their everyday lives, and that will increase.  We hope they can learn the truth about why this happening.  This is not the Russian people’s war, and it’s not a war of liberation or whatever else they’ve been told.  This is President Putin’s war to subjugate a sovereign, democratic country.  And until he ends it, the world will hold him accountable.</p>
<p>At this critical moment for democracy in Eastern Europe, it is all the more important that democracies like Estonia – all of the Baltics – continue to represent the better path, and rise to the challenge of the moment.  The United States will stand with you as you do.</p>
<p>Today, I should note, is International Women’s Day, and I’m very pleased to be in Estonia for it – because as is very clearly being demonstrated right now, Estonia has remarkably strong leaders who are women, including its prime minister, including its foreign minister, and because of Estonia’s commitment to closing the gender pay gap and advancing gender equality among other key metrics, it’s leading the world in all of these areas.</p>
<p>Today, we also think of the strength of the women of Ukraine.  Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian women have taken their children to safety in other countries, often leaving husbands behind – as well as many women who have joined the fight to protect the homeland themselves. The women of Ukraine embody the fortitude, the resilience, and courage of women everywhere.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Thank you.  We are now at your disposal for questions.  We will have two questions.  Please state to whom the question is addressed to, and please use microphone.</p>
<p>The first question by Tarmo Maiberg, from Estonian national broadcaster, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi.  First a question to Mr. Blinken – actually, a comment.  Russia and the United States should return to the principle of peaceful coexistence, like during the Cold War.  Just a quote from Russian foreign minister.  What do you think about that?  And the second part is:  In 2005, at the UN World Summit, was adopted unanimously the responsibility to protect.  It is an international norm that seeks to ensure that the international community never again fails to halt mass atrocity crimes.  Is United States with its allies failing to fulfill that promise when we are witnessing mass bombings in Ukraine’s cities against civilians?</p>
<p>And also to Prime Minister:  What about Estonia’s support embargo on Russia’s oil and gas?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.  “Peaceful coexistence” has two words; the first is “peaceful.”  And Russia’s doing everything in its power to make a mockery of that word through its aggression on Ukraine.  So if Russia wants to engage in peaceful coexistence, of course in principle we welcome it.  It needs to start by actually making good on the word “peaceful” and ending the war, the aggression that it is committing in Ukraine.  It’s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Second, with regard to the responsibility to protect, we have been working together for many months, and we continue to do that this very minute, to do just that – to do everything that we can to make sure that Ukrainians have the means to defend themselves against Russia’s war of choice on Ukraine, as well as to help those in Ukraine who are suffering with humanitarian assistance, those outside of Ukraine who need support with the support they need.</p>
<p>We’ve said for many, many months that if diplomacy did not succeed in diverting Russia from its course of aggression and Russia pursued that aggression, we would respond, we would be prepared to do so, and that’s exactly what we’ve been doing, both with regard to helping Ukrainians and helping Ukraine defend itself, also imposing severe costs, some of which I alluded to earlier, on Russia, all with the purpose of ending Russia’s aggression, ending the war, and indeed protecting the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>I think we brought tremendous resources to bear on this effort.  We brought the world together in this effort; 141 countries stood up at the United Nations condemning the aggression and supporting Ukraine.  And in the days and weeks ahead, working closely with our allies, we will step up the support that we’re providing, the efforts to help Ukraine defend itself, and to support its people.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER KALLAS:</strong>  Thank you.  We have put in place very strong sanctions, and we are working on the fourth package in the European Union to come forward with additional sanctions.  We are working together with our European allies, which means that everybody has to agree to those sanctions.  And right now we are working on making the SWIFT apply to everything.  We also are working on cryptocurrencies.  There are several elements as well.</p>
<p>What comes to Russian oil and gas embargo, then of course different European countries are in not equal amount dependent on Russian gas and oil, which means that if everybody has to be on board, then we also have to find alternatives into those countries.  And it seems to me that Putin is also doing – pushing all the countries towards a green transition, but it doesn’t happen overnight.  And therefore we will have discussions over this gas and oil embargo, but we also understand that we have to have alternative energy sources.  So everybody has to be on board, otherwise we – societies of different countries will be hurt more than necessary.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Thank you.  Second question by Rich Edson from Fox News.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  Madam Prime Minister, Mr. Secretary – sorry, I’m a little bit taller.  The – Prime Minister, you mentioned you would discuss how you can enhance your permanent defense posture.  What specifically do Estonia and the eastern flank need?  Is it more troops, tanks, equipment, air defenses?  And on what scale?</p>
<p>And Mr. Secretary, with the consideration of banning oil from Russia, are you working with companies?  Shell just a short while ago announced it’s phasing out Russia oil and gas purchases.  Also, where is the world going to find and replace that energy?  Can Iran and Venezuela be part of the solution?  Should we expect energy prices to rise further as a result of any Russia oil ban?  And separately, are you concerned Russia may obstruct progress in the Iran negotiations?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER KALLAS:</strong>  Thank you.  The short answer to your question is:  Everything.  But a longer answer is that we need different capabilities.  We need also troops, we also need technology, and we also need everything to work together.  What is the positive side of NATO is that we are in this collective defense alliance, which means that different Allies also support our collective defense by different means.  Some of them send troops, some technology.  But it also has to all work together.</p>
<p>So currently we are receiving different decisions from different Allies, and we are also looking forward to complete decisions by U.S. so that it will all play out.  But considering that we are a border country to a very aggressive Russia, we need to enhance our defense posture.  So far it has been deterrence posture, but we have to have a defense posture.  What means – what it means is that we have the troops, the capabilities, but also the practice of all of them working together.  Which means that we also need more military exercises on the ground, that we see that it all works.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Rich, thank you.  (Inaudible) to addressing your questions.</p>
<p>First, with regard to a potential oil embargo, an embargo on the importation of Russian oil, this is something, as I mentioned, that we had been discussing within the administration.  The President discussed this as well yesterday when he had a call with the French president, British prime minister, and the German chancellor, and something we’re very much actively looking at.</p>
<p>As a general proposition, we are working to maintain a steady global supply of energy, and looking at various places where we can make sure that that supply continues.  And we’re doing that, among other things, through our diplomatic efforts.  And as this crisis continues, again, we want to make sure that energy is widely available.  At the same time, as the prime minister said, there is I think a significant not only opportunity but imperative in this moment to finally move off of – referring to countries in Europe – dependence on Russian energy, because Russia uses it as a weapon.  And we’re seeing countries respond to that.  We’re working closely with them as they engage in those efforts.  It will take, as the prime minister said, some time to do that, but if you’ll forgive the bad pun, there is real energy in this effort.</p>
<p>And so all of these things come together – ensuring that there is a steady global supply of energy in the moment, ensuring that we’re working together on finding ways to diversify supply, and also doing this in a way that’s consistent with the agenda that we share dealing with climate change.  I think this only underscores the imperative of moving ahead as quickly as possible with renewable energy supply and sources.  So we’re working on bringing all of these things together, and with our diplomacy as well, making sure that energy supplies remain abundant coming from different places around the world.</p>
<p>With regard to the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, we continue to work to see if we can come back to mutual compliance with Iran on the deal.  Russia continues to be engaged in those efforts, and it has its own interests in ensuring that Iran is not able to acquire a nuclear weapon.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Thank you.  Unfortunately this is the whole time we had.  Thank you, everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Kaja Kallas, Estonian Prime Minister</p>
<p>Tallinn, Estonia</p>
<p>Stenbock House  </p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Dear guests, distinguished ladies and gentlemen of the press, we are very happy to welcome the Secretary of State of the United States of America here in Tallinn, in Estonia, in Stenbock House.  The Prime Minister of Estonia Kaja Kallas, and the Secretary of State of the United States of America Antony Blinken, will deliver statements and take two questions.  The press conference is held in English with simultaneous translation into Estonian.</p>
<p>First, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, please.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER KALLAS:</strong>  Thank you.  Dear Secretary Blinken, members of the press, it is my great pleasure to welcome you here in Tallinn.  I’ve been closely following your work and I admire it greatly.  I wish it could be under more pleasant circumstances, though.</p>
<p>Our discussion today focused on the sharply deteriorated security situation in Europe, but also the need to adopt a new reality, raising the cost of aggression to Russia and supporting Ukraine.  Putin’s war against the – against Ukraine is an act of military aggression against an independent and sovereign state that wants to fulfill its European dream.</p>
<p>We are standing here in the state elders room.  So the pictures you see around this room are of our state elders, the politicians that were running the country before the Soviet occupation.  It reminds us of how valuable independence and freedom is, and it also reminds us that we have a very aggressive neighbor that we have suffered under.</p>
<p>The (inaudible) war tactic is to terrorize civilians and put them to the front line of this war.  This is brutal and heartbreaking.  This tragedy demands first our continued and united support to Ukraine – political, humanitarian, economic, but also military.  Second, our focus must be on full isolation of Russia from the free world.  And third, we need to adapt to the new reality and also make changes in our own defense.</p>
<p>Ukraine fights bravely for its homeland.  What it needs urgently now is our military help.  And here the American commitment and help have been and are – continues to be crucial.  Estonia, together with the United States, was one of the first to give military support, even before the actual military attack happened on 24th of February.</p>
<p>We should stop the military machine of the aggressor.  The democratic world has stepped up against the war with speed, strength, and determination.  Our unity in action will help to tame the aggressor, but we need to be prepared for the worst, that the worst is still to come.  Hence Putin’s violence must be in correlation with the further sanctions and also isolation decisions.</p>
<p>First, we need to finalize and fully disclose SWIFT for Russia and Belarus.  Second, we have to restrict also cryptocurrencies.  This is equally important to close the loopholes.  We have also closed our air space, but we need to take a step forward and also close the sea ports for Russian vessels.  And we will keep finding new tools in our toolbox until Putin’s war machine has been paralyzed.</p>
<p>We are in this for the long haul.  We see already tremendous policy shifts vis-à-vis Russia across the European Union.  What we need next is also to have a strategic patience to keep these decisions in place.</p>
<p>Russia expects us to make a step back soon.  As Dmitry Medvedev explained to Putin in recent public meeting of the Russian security council, and I quote: “Sooner or later, they will get tired of their own initiative.  They will come to ask us about returning to discussions and negotiations regarding all the matters of strategic security,” end of quote.</p>
<p>So we will prove them wrong.  They will come to test us, and yes, we will have to resist.</p>
<p>The new security situation also demands rapid changes to European, including Estonian, defense.  Estonia has long spent over 2 percent of our GDP of our defense, and we continue to call others to do the same.  In January, my government made a decision to raise it even more.  This means that in 2023 our increased defense budget will be 2.44 percent of our GDP.</p>
<p>NATO needs to adapt quickly as well.  Decisions we have to make in the coming weeks and months need to include an upgrade strategy for defense in our region.  This means permanently strengthening our defense in air, on land, and at sea.</p>
<p>I would like to the thank the U.S. for your presence and for your quick decisions that led to increased footprint in the Baltic countries.  We have to keep on working together for the long-term decisions.  That is why I also ask today to establish a permanent and meaningful NATO’s forward defense in the Baltic region.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to thank you, Secretary Blinken, and the U.S. administration for your heavy work, including intense consultations that you have had with us and our other allies in building the unity and – within NATO.  Our unity and scale of our joint decisions prove the strength of our democracies.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Thank you.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, please.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good afternoon, everyone.  And Prime Minister, thank you so much – not just for the warm welcome today, but for the very good conversation.  I deeply appreciate your insights and admire your leadership.  So thank you for today.  And it was very good as well to be with my friend the foreign minister, and I want to send best wishes, of course, to the president as well.</p>
<p>It’s great to be in Tallinn as Secretary of State for the first time.  It’s meaningful to be here in particular on this hundredth anniversary year of our diplomatic relations.  But as the prime minister said, I also wish it were under different circumstances.</p>
<p>Together, over many months, as we saw the mounting likelihood of Russian aggression against Ukraine, we continued to hope for the best but we prepared for the worst.  And we have acted on all of those preparations, and I’ll come to that in a minute.</p>
<p>But over the past several days, at what is a critical moment for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the world, I’ve been engaged with allies and partners across the continent – in Brussels, with NATO, the European Union, G7 meetings; in Poland, where I visited a refugee welcome center and stood with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Ukrainian soil; in Moldova, a country seeking further integration into Europe; and finally, the three Baltic nations, Lithuania, Latvia, and today Estonia.</p>
<p>At every stop, I’ve emphasized the core values that bring our countries together – democracy, rule of law, a respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the international rules-based order that helps maintain peace and security everywhere.</p>
<p>And as I said yesterday in Lithuania and in Latvia, the people of Estonia – who lived through decades of Soviet occupation – understand in a profound way how wrong Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war in Ukraine is, how the world has to defend Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign, democratic country free to choose its own future.</p>
<p>The numbers of killed and wounded civilians in Ukraine continue to rise.  As of today, more than 1.7 million people have been forced to flee their own country.  More than 800,000 people have become internally displaced within Ukraine.  Many more people are trying to flee but can’t get out of besieged areas.  There have continued to be reports of shelling by Russian forces on agreed-upon humanitarian corridors.</p>
<p>We continue to call on Russia to allow for humanitarian access on the ground – both for supplies for people who have been cut off from food, water, medicine, and for humanitarian organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross that can negotiate true humanitarian corridors so that civilians can safely leave the country.</p>
<p>Estonia and the United States – together with our allies and partners – will continue to stand with Ukraine.  We’re increasing our security assistance to strengthen Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself.  Working with our humanitarian partners on the ground, we’re providing more aid to people who are still inside Ukraine as well as those who left.  And we’re raising the costs on the Kremlin and all who aid and abet its efforts in continuing this war of choice.</p>
<p>Our administration is also working with Congress to see to it that we do even more.  President Biden’s request for an additional $10 billion would enable us to surge security, humanitarian, and economic assistance where it’s needed.</p>
<p>For its part, Estonia has provided many kinds of assistance to Ukraine, including Javelin anti-tank missiles and Howitzers; food and medical aid to the front lines; a pledge to welcome more than 10,000 refugees if they choose to come here into Estonian homes, into Estonian communities.</p>
<p>And as everywhere we’ve been in the Baltics over this last day, we continue to see an outpouring of support for the Ukrainian people.  We continue to see the yellow and blue on homes and buildings.  And it’s a powerful message of solidarity.</p>
<p>And together, as the prime minister said, Estonia and the United States are bolstering our shared security and shared defense.  As President Biden said, we will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power.  Our commitment to Article 5 is ironclad.  An attack on one would be an attack on all.  We and our NATO Allies are prepared to meet any threat coming our direction, from wherever it comes.</p>
<p>NATO activated our defense plans for the eastern flank for the first time in its history in response to Russia’s aggression, giving the Supreme Allied Commander Europe the authority to deploy NATO response forces as needed.  Many Allies have increased their troop presence and contributed additional equipment and capabilities.</p>
<p>President Biden ordered the deployment of an additional 7,000 U.S. troops to Europe and moved forces already in Europe to NATO’s eastern flank.  We deployed F-35 strike fighter jets to the region; we’re augmenting NATO’s enhanced air policing mission.  And we’re working with Estonia and its Baltic neighbors on cybersecurity and energy security, which are also critically important to our shared security.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, the Baltics have formed a democratic wall that’s now standing against the tide of authoritarianism that Moscow is seeking to push further into Europe.  Estonia has become one of the most advanced digital societies in the world, with a strong free press, a business culture fueled by innovation, citizens empowered to do everything from voting to getting a passport online.</p>
<p>What a comparison to Moscow, which viciously targets journalists and floods the internet and airwaves with disinformation, both around the world and at home.</p>
<p>Many people in Russia have no idea what their government is doing right now in Ukraine.  They think they’re liberating Ukraine, not destroying it.  Moscow has banned Facebook and Twitter to make it easier to sell its lies.</p>
<p>One of the weak points of autocracies is that they rely on total control of information.  So we will continue in our efforts to counter Russian disinformation and expose the true costs of this war to the Russian people – both the profound costs to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, and the costs to Russian people themselves, which are mounting every single day.</p>
<p>The ruble has cratered.  Mastercard, Visa, Apple Pay have shut down.  Dozens of leading companies – from Nike to Coca-Cola, FedEx to Spotify, Netflix to Toyota – have exited the country.  President Putin is making Russia a pariah – destroying in the space of a week 30 years of international openness and opportunity.</p>
<p>The Russian people are already feeling the effects of this in their everyday lives, and that will increase.  We hope they can learn the truth about why this happening.  This is not the Russian people’s war, and it’s not a war of liberation or whatever else they’ve been told.  This is President Putin’s war to subjugate a sovereign, democratic country.  And until he ends it, the world will hold him accountable.</p>
<p>At this critical moment for democracy in Eastern Europe, it is all the more important that democracies like Estonia – all of the Baltics – continue to represent the better path, and rise to the challenge of the moment.  The United States will stand with you as you do.</p>
<p>Today, I should note, is International Women’s Day, and I’m very pleased to be in Estonia for it – because as is very clearly being demonstrated right now, Estonia has remarkably strong leaders who are women, including its prime minister, including its foreign minister, and because of Estonia’s commitment to closing the gender pay gap and advancing gender equality among other key metrics, it’s leading the world in all of these areas.</p>
<p>Today, we also think of the strength of the women of Ukraine.  Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian women have taken their children to safety in other countries, often leaving husbands behind – as well as many women who have joined the fight to protect the homeland themselves. The women of Ukraine embody the fortitude, the resilience, and courage of women everywhere.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Thank you.  We are now at your disposal for questions.  We will have two questions.  Please state to whom the question is addressed to, and please use microphone.</p>
<p>The first question by Tarmo Maiberg, from Estonian national broadcaster, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi.  First a question to Mr. Blinken – actually, a comment.  Russia and the United States should return to the principle of peaceful coexistence, like during the Cold War.  Just a quote from Russian foreign minister.  What do you think about that?  And the second part is:  In 2005, at the UN World Summit, was adopted unanimously the responsibility to protect.  It is an international norm that seeks to ensure that the international community never again fails to halt mass atrocity crimes.  Is United States with its allies failing to fulfill that promise when we are witnessing mass bombings in Ukraine’s cities against civilians?</p>
<p>And also to Prime Minister:  What about Estonia’s support embargo on Russia’s oil and gas?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.  “Peaceful coexistence” has two words; the first is “peaceful.”  And Russia’s doing everything in its power to make a mockery of that word through its aggression on Ukraine.  So if Russia wants to engage in peaceful coexistence, of course in principle we welcome it.  It needs to start by actually making good on the word “peaceful” and ending the war, the aggression that it is committing in Ukraine.  It’s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Second, with regard to the responsibility to protect, we have been working together for many months, and we continue to do that this very minute, to do just that – to do everything that we can to make sure that Ukrainians have the means to defend themselves against Russia’s war of choice on Ukraine, as well as to help those in Ukraine who are suffering with humanitarian assistance, those outside of Ukraine who need support with the support they need.</p>
<p>We’ve said for many, many months that if diplomacy did not succeed in diverting Russia from its course of aggression and Russia pursued that aggression, we would respond, we would be prepared to do so, and that’s exactly what we’ve been doing, both with regard to helping Ukrainians and helping Ukraine defend itself, also imposing severe costs, some of which I alluded to earlier, on Russia, all with the purpose of ending Russia’s aggression, ending the war, and indeed protecting the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>I think we brought tremendous resources to bear on this effort.  We brought the world together in this effort; 141 countries stood up at the United Nations condemning the aggression and supporting Ukraine.  And in the days and weeks ahead, working closely with our allies, we will step up the support that we’re providing, the efforts to help Ukraine defend itself, and to support its people.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER KALLAS:</strong>  Thank you.  We have put in place very strong sanctions, and we are working on the fourth package in the European Union to come forward with additional sanctions.  We are working together with our European allies, which means that everybody has to agree to those sanctions.  And right now we are working on making the SWIFT apply to everything.  We also are working on cryptocurrencies.  There are several elements as well.</p>
<p>What comes to Russian oil and gas embargo, then of course different European countries are in not equal amount dependent on Russian gas and oil, which means that if everybody has to be on board, then we also have to find alternatives into those countries.  And it seems to me that Putin is also doing – pushing all the countries towards a green transition, but it doesn’t happen overnight.  And therefore we will have discussions over this gas and oil embargo, but we also understand that we have to have alternative energy sources.  So everybody has to be on board, otherwise we – societies of different countries will be hurt more than necessary.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Thank you.  Second question by Rich Edson from Fox News.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  Madam Prime Minister, Mr. Secretary – sorry, I’m a little bit taller.  The – Prime Minister, you mentioned you would discuss how you can enhance your permanent defense posture.  What specifically do Estonia and the eastern flank need?  Is it more troops, tanks, equipment, air defenses?  And on what scale?</p>

<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER KALLAS:</strong>  Thank you.  The short answer to your question is:  Everything.  But a longer answer is that we need different capabilities.  We need also troops, we also need technology, and we also need everything to work together.  What is the positive side of NATO is that we are in this collective defense alliance, which means that different Allies also support our collective defense by different means.  Some of them send troops, some technology.  But it also has to all work together.</p>

<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Rich, thank you.  (Inaudible) to addressing your questions.</p>
<p>First, with regard to a potential oil embargo, an embargo on the importation of Russian oil, this is something, as I mentioned, that we had been discussing within the administration.  The President discussed this as well yesterday when he had a call with the French president, British prime minister, and the German chancellor, and something we’re very much actively looking at.</p>
<p>As a general proposition, we are working to maintain a steady global supply of energy, and looking at various places where we can make sure that that supply continues.  And we’re doing that, among other things, through our diplomatic efforts.  And as this crisis continues, again, we want to make sure that energy is widely available.  At the same time, as the prime minister said, there is I think a significant not only opportunity but imperative in this moment to finally move off of – referring to countries in Europe – dependence on Russian energy, because Russia uses it as a weapon.  And we’re seeing countries respond to that.  We’re working closely with them as they engage in those efforts.  It will take, as the prime minister said, some time to do that, but if you’ll forgive the bad pun, there is real energy in this effort.</p>

<p>With regard to the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, we continue to work to see if we can come back to mutual compliance with Iran on the deal.  Russia continues to be engaged in those efforts, and it has its own interests in ensuring that Iran is not able to acquire a nuclear weapon.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Thank you.  Unfortunately this is the whole time we had.  Thank you, everyone.</p>
