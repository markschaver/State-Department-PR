					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I congratulate the Norwegian people as you celebrate Constitution Day.  This year, I also send a hearty congratulations for setting a new record for the largest number of gold medals won by a single country at a Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>As Norwegians celebrate their Constitution of 1814, Americans are reminded of the cherished democratic values that our two countries share that bind us together.  The close relationship between our two nations stems in part from waves of Norwegian emigration to the United States from 1825 to 1940, giving the United States today nearly as many people of Norwegian ancestry as the population of Norway.  The United States and Norway have been NATO Allies for more than 70 years, and we stand together in our shared commitment to freedom, collective security, and human rights.  As Allies, we defend against threats to democratic values and address global challenges.  The United States appreciates the close coordination with Norway as we respond to the actions of regimes that seek to repress fundamental freedoms and undermine the international rules-based order.  This coordination is all the more important as we work together to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine.  As partners, we will deepen our collaboration to combat the climate crisis and strengthen our vibrant people-to-people ties in the years to come.</p>
<p>I join you in celebrating this anniversary and send best wishes for health and prosperity to all Norwegians.  Gratulerer med dagen!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States is designating Attorney General of Guatemala Maria Consuelo Porras Argueta de Porres (“Porras”) due to her involvement in significant corruption.  During her tenure, Porras repeatedly obstructed and undermined anticorruption investigations in Guatemala to protect her political allies and gain undue political favor.  Porras’s pattern of obstruction includes reportedly ordering prosecutors in Guatemala’s Public Ministry to ignore cases based on political considerations and firing prosecutors who investigate cases involving acts of corruption.</p>
<p>This public designation is made under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2022. Under this authority, designated officials of foreign governments involved in significant corruption and their immediate family members are ineligible for entry into the United States.  The Department is also designating Porras’s husband Gilberto de Jesus Porres de Paz.  The designation follows Porras’s September 2021 inclusion on the list of corrupt and undemocratic actors submitted to the U.S. Congress under Section 353 of the United States – Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act. The Department is actively considering additional designations under Section 353, including making new designations public at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>These designations reaffirm the commitment of the United States to combat corruption, which undermines the Guatemalan people’s faith in their democratic institutions.  The United States continues to stand with all Guatemalans in support of democracy and the rule of law and against those who would undermine these principles for personal gain.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States congratulates the people of Somalia on the conclusion of their national electoral process. We also congratulate Hassan Sheikh Mohamud on his election as the president of the Federal Republic of Somalia and look forward to working closely with him and the new government.</p>
<p>With the conclusion of this process, Somalia now has an opportunity to focus on the political, economic, and security reforms necessary to advance the interests of the people of Somalia. We encourage President Hassan Sheikh and all of Somalia’s leaders to prioritize strengthening democratic governance and institutions; developing security forces to prevent and counter terrorism and assume full security responsibility from the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia; enacting economic reforms to complete Somalia’s path to debt relief and strengthen the economy; and facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid to the millions of Somalis suffering from devastating drought.  Reconciliation, compromise, and enhanced dialogue among all levels of government and all communities will be vital to the success of these efforts.</p>
<p>The United States looks forward to the timely formation of a new government and partnering with Somalia’s leaders to achieve our shared goal of a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous Somalia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Administration’s policy towards Cuba continues to focus first and foremost on support for the Cuban people, including their human rights and their political and economic well-being.</p>
<p>Today, the Administration announced measures to further support the Cuban people, providing them additional tools to pursue a life free from Cuban government oppression and to seek greater economic opportunities.</p>
<p>We will reinstate the Cuban Family Reunification Parole (CFRP) Program and further increase consular services and visa processing, making it possible for more Cubans to join their families in the United States via regular migration channels.</p>
<p>We will make it easier for families to visit their relatives in Cuba and for authorized U.S. travelers to engage with the Cuban people, attend meetings, and conduct research.</p>
<p>We will encourage the growth of Cuba’s private sector by supporting greater access to U.S. Internet services, applications, and e-commerce platforms.  We will support new avenues for electronic payments and for U.S. business activities with independent Cuban entrepreneurs, including through increased access to microfinance and training.</p>
<p>We also will support Cuban families and entrepreneurs by enabling increased remittance flows to the Cuban people in ways that do not enrich human rights abusers.  We will lift the family remittance cap of $1,000 per quarter and will support donative remittances to Cuban entrepreneurs, both with the goal of further empowering families to support each other and for entrepreneurs to expand their businesses.</p>
<p>With these actions, we aim to support Cubans’ aspirations for freedom and for greater economic opportunities so that they can lead successful lives at home.  We continue to call on the Cuban government to immediately release political prisoners, to respect the Cuban people’s fundamental freedoms and to allow the Cuban people to determine their own futures.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today, the United States is taking a series of measures to increase support for the Cuban people in line with our national security interests.  The Cuban people are confronting an unprecedented humanitarian crisis — and our policy will continue to focus on empowering the Cuban people to help them create a future free from repression and economic suffering.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Administration will:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Facilitate family reunification by reinstating the Cuban Family Reunification Parole (CFRP) Program </b>and continuing to increase capacity for consular services. Limited immigrant visa processing resumed in Havana on May 3, 2022. We will reinstate the CFRP and increase visa processing in Havana while continuing to process the majority of immigrant visa cases at the U.S. Embassy in Georgetown, Guyana.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strengthen family ties and facilitate educational connections for the U.S. and Cuban people by expanding authorized travel in support of the Cuban people. </b>We will authorize scheduled and charter flights to locations beyond Havana. We also will implement regulatory changes to reinstate group people-to-people and other categories of group educational travel, as well as certain travel related to professional meetings and professional research, including to support expanded Internet access and remittance processing companies and to provide additional support to Cuban entrepreneurs. We are not reinstating individual people-to-people travel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Increase support for independent Cuban entrepreneurs. </b>We will encourage commercial opportunities outside of the state sector by authorizing access to expanded cloud technology, application programming interfaces, and e-commerce platforms. We will explore options to expand support of additional payment options for Internet-based activities, electronic payments, and business with independent Cuban entrepreneurs. We will work to expand entrepreneurs’ access to microfinance and training.<b> </b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Ensure that remittances flow more freely to the Cuban people while not enriching those who perpetrate human rights abuses. </b>Specifically, we will remove the current limit on family remittances of $1,000 per quarter per sender-receiver pair and will authorize donative (i.e., non-family) remittances, which will support independent Cuban entrepreneurs. We will engage with electronic payment processors to encourage increased Cuban market accessibility. We will not remove entities from the Cuba Restricted List.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Administration is working expeditiously to effectuate these changes, which will be implemented via steps taken and regulatory changes made by relevant Departments and Agencies in short order.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State works to protect sea turtles around the world through its certification program, which allows for the importation of wild-caught shrimp into the United States, pursuant to Section 609 of Public Law 101-162 (“Section 609”).  Each year, the Secretary of State (or his delegate) certifies to Congress those governments and authorities of shrimp-harvesting nations and economies that have programs to reduce the incidental taking of sea turtles in shrimp trawl fisheries that are comparable to the United States, or that their particular fishing environments do not pose a threat of the incidental taking of sea turtles.</p>
<p>This year, the Department certified 37 nations and one economy, and granted determinations for thirteen fisheries as having adequate measures in place to protect sea turtles while harvesting wild-caught shrimp.  Annual certifications and determinations are based in part on overseas verification visits by a team composed of Department of State and NOAA Fisheries representatives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State works to protect sea turtles around the world through its certification program, which allows for the importation of wild-caught shrimp into the United States, pursuant to Section 609 of Public Law 101-162 (“Section 609”).  Each year, the Secretary of State (or his delegate) certifies to Congress those governments and authorities of shrimp-harvesting nations and economies that have programs to reduce the incidental taking of sea turtles in shrimp trawl fisheries that are comparable to the United States, or that their particular fishing environments do not pose a threat of the incidental taking of sea turtles.</p>
<p>This year, the Department certified 37 nations and one economy, and granted determinations for thirteen fisheries as having adequate measures in place to protect sea turtles while harvesting wild-caught shrimp.  Annual certifications and determinations are based in part on overseas verification visits by a team composed of Department of State and NOAA Fisheries representatives.</p>
<p>Six of the world’s seven species of marine turtles are listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act.  The U.S. government is currently providing technology and capacity-building assistance to other nations to help them meet the standard for certification under Section 609 and to contribute to the recovery of sea turtle species.  The U.S. government also encourages legislation like Section 609 in other nations to prevent the importation of shrimp harvested in a manner harmful to protected sea turtles.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a joint advisory to alert the international community, the private sector, and the public to attempts by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and remote DPRK information technology (IT) workers to obtain employment while posing as non-DPRK nationals.</p>
<p>The advisory is intended to provide freelance recruitment and digital payment platforms, along with private sector companies that may intentionally or inadvertently recruit, hire, or facilitate the hiring of DPRK IT workers, with information and tools to counter the risks associated with these activities.</p>
<p>Hiring or supporting the activities of DPRK IT workers poses many risks, ranging from theft of intellectual property, data, and funds to reputational harm and legal consequences, including sanctions under both United States and United Nations authorities.</p>
<p>The advisory provides detailed information on how DPRK IT workers operate and identifies red flags to help companies avoid hiring them and identify those who may already be abusing their services. Additionally, it provides information about relevant United States and United Nations sanctions, including a non-exhaustive list of activities for which persons could be sanctioned by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>The United States is committed to disrupting illicit DPRK revenue-generating activities, which may facilitate criminal activity, provide direct support to the DPRK’s unlawful weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs, and threaten international peace and security.</p>
<p>The advisory along with a two-page summary version are available <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/north-korea-sanctions" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">here</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The text of the following statement was released by the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States following the 21st session of the UN Permanent Forum for Indigenous Issues, which was held from April 25th to May 6th, 2022.</p>
<p><em>Begin Text:</em></p>
<p>We recognize that Indigenous women, young women, and girls in all their diversity, and two-spirit and gender-diverse individuals face disproportionately high rates of gender-based violence. This violence is a multidimensional phenomenon that is predicated on histories of abuse and perpetuated by ongoing discrimination and racism, including multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.  The violence includes, but is not limited to, murders, sexual assault, trafficking, and intimate-partner violence. Too often, the disappearance or murder of Indigenous women, young women, and girls in all their diversity and two-spirit and gender-diverse individuals is not met with swift, effective, and culturally relevant action, including the lack of processes in Indigenous languages, by government institutions to investigate and resolve these cases.  Much work needs to be done to enhance intervention, access to justice, and to strengthen prevention efforts.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada indicates that 56 percent of Indigenous women in Canada have experienced physical assault while 46 percent have experienced sexual assault. According to the latest National Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships (ENDIREH), carried out in 2016 by the National Institute of Geography and Statistics in Mexico, it is estimated that 59 percent of Indigenous women have experienced some type of violence (emotional, physical, sexual, economic, patrimonial or labor discrimination) throughout their lives.  According to the U.S. National Institute of Justice, 84 percent of Native American women in the United States have experienced physical, sexual, or psychological violence in their lifetime, often at the hands of non-Native perpetrators. Emerging data from UN Women shows that impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have intensified gender-based violence globally.</p>
<p>We know this is not a problem limited to our three countries or our region, and we welcome cooperation from other governments, civil-society organizations, and other entities in the elimination of all forms of discrimination and gender-based violence perpetrated against Indigenous women and girls in diverse communities.</p>
<p>First established as an outcome of the June 2016 North American Leaders’ Summit, the Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls (Trilateral Working Group) is an initiative to reaffirm and to advance our respective national and regional commitments to prevent and respond to gender-based violence impacting Indigenous peoples in North America through increased access to justice and services, with an intersectional, gender-responsive, human rights and culturally-responsive approaches.</p>
<p>In July 2022, the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States will convene the fourth meeting of the Trilateral Working Group, hosted by the United States. This dialogue, which will include the participation of Indigenous women experts, leaders, and advocates, will address the multi-faceted aspects, including root causes that increase vulnerability to gender-based violence, access to justice and enhanced accountability, and increased resources for survivors.</p>
<p>The themes of the 4th Trilateral Working Group meeting will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthening access to justice, culturally appropriate approaches to safety and healing, and addressing the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, young women, and girls in all their diversity and two-spirit and gender-diverse individuals, including trafficking in persons;</li>
<li>Advancing Indigenous women’s leadership and representation at all levels; and</li>
<li>Addressing the root causes of gender-based violence against Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit and gender-diverse individuals, including economic security and food insecurity related to the climate crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Members of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues issued recommendations in 2018 urging the Canada, Mexico, and the United States, to organize an international expert group meeting by 2021 on the issue of ongoing violence against Indigenous women and girls in the region, including trafficking, as well as the continuing crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit and gender-diverse individuals.</p>
<p>At the North American Leaders’ Summit on November 18, President Biden, President Lopez Obrador, and Prime Minister Trudeau committed to convene a meeting of Indigenous women leaders as part of the Trilateral Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls.  To this end, in November 2021, we convened Indigenous women leaders from across the three countries of North America for a virtual engagement to center their expertise and recommendations on addressing these issues.  The themes identified for the upcoming 4th Trilateral Working Group arose directly from this convening. We welcome opportunities in the future to engage with international experts from other regions following this next meeting of the Trilateral Working Group.</p>
<p>We recognize that ending violence against Indigenous women and girls requires a holistic, multidimensional, and multi-sectoral approach. We reiterate our unwavering commitment as our three countries continue working together, in partnership with Indigenous peoples from our three countries, to eliminate this epidemic of gender-based violence and attain our goals of safety, security, well-being, and empowerment for all members of Indigenous communities.</p>
