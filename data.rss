					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Melbourne, Australia</p>
<p>University of Melbourne Biomedical Precinct</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you so much, Dean.  And it’s – thanks to everyone for being here today.  Really, it’s wonderful to be with you, it’s wonderful to be in Melbourne, and it’s wonderful to be at the university in no small measure because of the family connection that we have here.  And I should probably reveal, just cards on the table in case this is a problem for anyone – I have a particular allegiance to Carlton when it comes to (inaudible).  (Laughter.)  I’ve been, I’ve seen them play.  So I just wanted to make sure that I was honest about that.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>MS GUNN:</b>  We’ll allow it.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.</p>
<p>I really want to pick up, Dean, where you brought us because, look, as – at a national level between our countries, between Australia and the United States, I think it’s safe to say that we have been leaders, and leaders together, in trying to deal with COVID and also in trying to build back better so that we have an even stronger, more effective global health security system after we get through this.</p>
<p>But of course, we’re not through it yet and the work that we’re doing together, whether it comes to the production of vaccines, the distribution of vaccines, everything that goes into them, trying to get shots into arms, working on therapeutics, making sure that we’re supporting health care workers who are on the front lines of this – all of that is vitally important, and we know and we continue to experience that the cliché that no one is safe until everyone is safe is profoundly true.  And I know that between our governments – and this is something I’ll be spending some time on here – there is a very deep-seated commitment to do as much as we possibly can this year to really once and for all get ahead of this pandemic.  We’ve said – projected of having 70 percent vaccination in every country in the world by year’s end.  We intend to see that through, but we know the challenges that go with getting that done and getting that done effectively, but at the same time, as we’re doing that, we have to be building a stronger global health security system so that next time around we’re better prepared where we can deal more effectively; hopefully we can prevent, we can detect, we can mitigate more effectively.</p>
<p>But for all the work that the governments are doing – and it’s absolutely necessary – I think what gives me the most cause for optimism are the public-private partnerships that we’ve been building and, of course, the work of the private sector to finally get us to a better place.  And part of why I wanted to get together today, and I’m grateful to all of you for doing that, is to put a bit of a spotlight on that, and in particular the fact that America and Australia together are building these across our countries and across our governments and across our private sectors, building exactly these kind of interconnected partnerships where government can be the ultimate – a catalyst and a facilitator, but at the same time the private sector is doing extraordinary work to really advance our progress.</p>
<p>And I’m anxious to hear from all of you today.  I know from the work that’s been done it’s incredibly gratifying to have Moderna, which is I think a household name now literally around the world, and that’s quite extraordinary.  But the partnership with the Australian Government to open what will be the first mRNA facility, production facility here in this part of the world is a perfect example of how free, open societies can actually come together and deliver benefits not only for our own people but this is going to benefit people around the world.  So this will be the first facility in the Southern Hemisphere to manufacture mRNA vaccines, and that’s going to be a very powerful thing.  It&#8217;s also, I’m convinced, going to have a ripple effect – a ripple effect in terms of jobs, a ripple effect in terms of preparing for the future as we need to do, and a ripple effect around the world not just for our two countries but throughout the region and beyond.  And I think it only serves to further solidify Australia’s leadership in dealing with global health security, the pandemic, and the problem.</p>
<p>We have colleagues from Illumina here.  This is another great example of how close-knit our partnership is and doing it in a way that serves the public good.  Even in my short time here today and just in reading about the University of Melbourne and what’s going on here as a remarkable place of knowledge, of learning, of innovation, the genomics hub right here, a partnership again that is going to be serving the public good.  And there, too, the government has a profound role to play in this partnership with the private sector as well as work that’s being done with the university is actually making a difference, and I’m gratified again that American firms are part of this, making these investments, driving these partnerships.</p>
<p>We have IBM, and there again, working on another aspect of things, and that’s the – all the potential of artificial intelligence.  We are developing standards together – our governments are working on this as well – to make sure that as technology emerges, it does so in a way that lifts people up and tries to advance the common good and is not used for repressive or malign interests.</p>
<p>So there are multiple examples of this.  I just thought this was a wonderful way to illustrate how both our countries and governments are working together, but also how we’re doing this in a public-private way, and hopefully to the benefit of a lot of people.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Melbourne, Australia</p>
<p>University of Melbourne</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, good morning.  So wonderful to be with you today, to start the day in Australia, to start the day here at the University of Melbourne.  And I was particularly looking forward to this event, having an opportunity to have a conversation, to hear from you, to exchange some thoughts.  And as the vice chancellor said, there are a lot of reasons why I’m here in Australia, and we can get into those.  But there are a couple of particular reasons why I’m here at the university, on this campus at this time.  One of them has to do with the fact that I really wanted to engage with some of the sharpest and youngest minds in the country and talk about the future that we have, I hope, together between our countries.</p>
<p>But as the vice chancellor said, there’s also something profoundly personal about this for me.  As he noted, my late stepfather, Samuel Pisar, was an alumnus of this institution.  And without going into too many details, let me say this, because I think it resonates profoundly over the years:  He was born in Bialystok, Poland and born before the Second World War.  Bialystok, Poland was a thriving center of Jewish life in Poland before the war.  But he turned out to be the only member of his immediate family to survive.  There were about 900 kids in the school in Bialystok; he’s the only that survived from that school.  His mother, his father, his sister perished in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>He himself, after enduring Soviet occupation of the ghetto, was shipped off to work camps and concentration camps – Auschwitz, Dachau, Majdanek, and others.  After the war though, as it was ending and he was on a death march out of the camps, he made an escape for it and somehow managed to escape, to survive, to be rescued by American GIs, and to be brought back into the world.</p>
<p>But the reason he was brought back into the world was ultimately because of Australia.  He had an aunt who had left Poland before the war to go to Paris, two uncles – Lazar Sokolofsky who came to Australia – and they ultimately brought him in.  And he had had, of course, no education for four years.  He was 16 years old by the time he got to Australia.  And as he put it, as he told us, as he told the family for years, Australia remade him.  It remade him as a person, it remade him as someone who followed intellectual pursuits, it remade him into a human being.</p>
<p>And this institution was fundamental to that.  Sir Zelman Cowen, who was referenced, was his great mentor.  After being here, after going to the law academy, Sir Zelman managed to help him get a scholarship to Harvard Law School in the United States.  He wound up being an advisor to President Kennedy, had an extraordinary career as a writer and as a lawyer.</p>
<p>But for him and thus for our family, Australia has a particularly special place.  It showed, after a demonstration of how humanity is capable of the worst, it’s also capable of the best – literally bringing someone back to life in every aspect of what that means.</p>
<p>And I want to say too, he somehow escaped from the horrors of that time with his best friend, Ben Kaufman, and Ben too came to Australia.  My stepfather insisted that his uncles bring Ben as well.  And Ben stayed in Australia, built an extraordinary life here in Melbourne, a family.  I think somewhere out here is his son Paul Kaufman.  Paul, are you here?  (Applause.)  Ben, his wife Bebka, Paul, Molly, his sister – we’ve all been mates for life, and so good to see you, my friend.</p>
<p>And that brings me to today.  Our countries too, our people too, in an incredibly challenging time I think are also mates for life.  And there’s a simple reason for that.  Despite the vast distance between us geographically, the distance that I traveled yesterday, there’s virtually no distance between us when it comes to our basic outlook, to our basic values, to our basic interests.  And at a time when so many of those values and interests are being challenged, I think there’s more of an imperative than ever that our two countries be together, work together, tackle these challenges together.</p>
<p>And I’ll just say this before we get into the conversation, which is from the perspective of the United States:  As we’re looking out at the things that truly have an effect on all of us, all of our citizens in different ways every day, whether it’s the changing climate, whether it’s this pandemic that we all continue to live through, whether it’s the impact of emerging technologies that are literally shaping our lives, what we know in the United States, half a world away, is that we cannot effectively deal with these challenges alone.  Whatever our power, whatever our resources, whatever our capabilities, we simply can’t do it.</p>
<p>When it comes to climate, we’re 15 percent of global emissions.  Even if we did everything right at home, we still have to deal with the other 85 percent of emissions that are coming from other countries.  So we have an imperative of finding ways to work together.</p>
<p>COVID, as we’ve all been living through – we know this – it may – it may become a cliché, but it is profoundly true.  No one is safe until everyone is safe, and as long as the disease is percolating somewhere and a variant could pop up, you might get a variant that defeats everything you’ve done.  And so we have a profound incentive together in making sure that the world is vaccinated.</p>
<p>And these technologies that we’re all dealing with every day – the phones that I see on everyone’s table, that are in my pocket – we know that the way they’re used – the rules, the norms that shape the way they’re used, are either going to help them be technologies that advance the good in humanity or do the opposite.  And there again, we have a strong incentive in coming together to determine what those rules will be, what those norms will be, what those standards will be.</p>
<p>And that all starts with likeminded countries, countries coming from the same basic value set, the same (inaudible), putting their resources together, putting their thinking together, putting their energies together to try to advance and make progress.  And that’s fundamentally what this relationship between the United States and Australia is all about.  That’s at least what I believe it’s about.  But I’m anxious to hear from you what you think it’s about – what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong, and how we should be thinking about it.</p>
<p>So I’m really grateful to start this trip here, to start it with you, and I welcome the conversation.  (Applause.)</p>

<p>And that brings me to today.  Our countries too, our people too, in an incredibly challenging time I think are also mates for life.  And there’s a simple reason for that.  Despite the vast distance between us geographically, the distance that I traveled yesterday, there’s virtually no distance between us when it comes to our basic outlook, to our basic values, to our basic interests.  And at a time when so many of those values and interests are being challenged, I think there’s more of an imperative than ever that our two countries be together, work together, tackle these challenges together.</p>
<p>And I’ll just say this before we get into the conversation, which is from the perspective of the United States:  As we’re looking out at the things that truly have an effect on all of us, all of our citizens in different ways every day, whether it’s the changing climate, whether it’s this pandemic that we all continue to live through, whether it’s the impact of emerging technologies that are literally shaping our lives, what we know in the United States, half a world away, is that we cannot effectively deal with these challenges alone.  Whatever our power, whatever our resources, whatever our capabilities, we simply can’t do it.</p>
<p>When it comes to climate, we’re 15 percent of global emissions.  Even if we did everything right at home, we still have to deal with the other 85 percent of emissions that are coming from other countries.  So we have an imperative of finding ways to work together.</p>
<p>COVID, as we’ve all been living through – we know this – it may – it may become a cliché, but it is profoundly true.  No one is safe until everyone is safe, and as long as the disease is percolating somewhere and a variant could pop up, you might get a variant that defeats everything you’ve done.  And so we have a profound incentive together in making sure that the world is vaccinated.</p>
<p>And these technologies that we’re all dealing with every day – the phones that I see on everyone’s table, that are in my pocket – we know that the way they’re used – the rules, the norms that shape the way they’re used, are either going to help them be technologies that advance the good in humanity or do the opposite.  And there again, we have a strong incentive in coming together to determine what those rules will be, what those norms will be, what those standards will be.</p>
<p>And that all starts with likeminded countries, countries coming from the same basic value set, the same (inaudible), putting their resources together, putting their thinking together, putting their energies together to try to advance and make progress.  And that’s fundamentally what this relationship between the United States and Australia is all about.  That’s at least what I believe it’s about.  But I’m anxious to hear from you what you think it’s about – what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong, and how we should be thinking about it.</p>
<p>So I’m really grateful to start this trip here, to start it with you, and I welcome the conversation.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Hello. Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining today’s State Department press briefing. I don’t have any announcements to make at the top, but I’ll give it a few minutes before I start taking your questions.</p>
<p>Let’s go to the line of Francesco Fontemaggi, please.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR: </strong> Thank you. That line is open.</p>
<p><a id="post-312922-Iran"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Jalina. Happy – what is this – Wednesday. I wanted to know – I know yesterday you guys were saying that you hadn’t had a full readout from France about President Macron visit to Moscow. So do you have now, and do you have something to say about the (inaudible) comments that the President Macron made after his talks with Putin?</p>
<p>And on another side, I just wonder if you have anything new on the Vienna talks to share with us. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Francesco. I’ll start with your second one. Outside of what I shared yesterday, actually, we don’t have anything to read out or update on the Vienna talks. Special Envoy Malley continues to work with partners in the sidelines, and he also continues to brief Congress remotely. But nothing major to read out or share today.</p>
<p><a id="post-312922-RussiaFrance"></a> To your first question, we of course typically wouldn’t read out another country’s meeting. But again, we continue to coordinate closely with our allies and partners.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Matt Lee, please.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR: </strong> Thank you. Just as a reminder, everyone, you may press 1 then zero to join the question queue. Matt Lee, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. Hey, there. I hope you can hear me.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yeah, I can hear – it’s a little faint, but I can hear you.</p>
<p><a id="post-312922-Iran2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Hold on. Let me hold the phone up a little closer. Sorry. I just wanted to follow up on the answer that you gave me yesterday on INARA and the Iran talks and any potential new agreement. You said yesterday, “The administration will carefully consider the facts as well as the circumstances of any U.S. return to the JCPOA to determine what the legal implications, which would include under INARA.” And then you said, “We’re committed to ensuring the requirements of INARA are satisfied.”</p>
<p>I don’t know if you’re going to be able to answer my question in the level of specificity that I think it requires. So if you need to take it, that’s fine. But I would appreciate an answer if you can get one from the lawyers. And my question is this: Does being “committed to ensuring the requirements of INARA are satisfied” – that was your quote – does that mean that you will submit any agreement that is reached in Vienna to Congress for approval? Not just to send them a notification of “Hi there, this is what we just did,” but to fulfill the spirit – the letter and the spirit of the law, which requires a congressional review and a vote?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Matt. I’m not able to make any determinations today on whether we will submit the report to Congress. As I’ve said before and as you know well, that Special Envoy Malley and those of us here continue to coordinate closely with various partners in Congress. And of course we remain committed to those engagements, of course in a bipartisan manner as it relates to – as Iran policy continues to develop. But anything beyond that we’d be happy to get you more details at a later time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Tony Lewis, please.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR: </strong> Thank you. That line is open.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Do we have Tony on the line?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you mean me, Jalina? Simon.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Hi. I can hear you now. Thank you.</p>
<p>Tony, do we have you? Mr. Operator, if we can come back to Tony and for now move on to Christina Ruffini, please.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR: </strong> I believe the person on Tony’s line is Simon.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Oh, Simon Lewis. Okay. Well, let’s &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. It’s Simon Lewis, not Tony. I don’t know who Tony Lewis is.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> I don’t, either.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Thanks, Jalina.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> (Inaudible) Simon.</p>
<p><a id="post-312922-UkraineRegion"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. I just wanted to follow up on Francesco’s question on some of President Macron’s comments since his meetings in Moscow and Kyiv. There’s a discussion about whether a solution to the current tensions would be a Finlandization of Ukraine, and Macron sort of admitted that that could be – or considered that could be one of the models on the table for defusing the tension. So does the U.S. have a position on whether that’s – whether that is a possibility?</p>
<p>And secondly, there’s been talk of the solution to this could be through the Minsk protocols. I wonder if you could sort of – if you have any kind of new position on that, given these talks that have gone on with the Europeans, the Ukrainians, and the Russians, and whether you could say specifically what is it that both Ukraine – you would expect both Ukraine and Russia to do to kind of get back into line with what they’ve agreed under those protocols. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Simon, to correct for the record – excuse me about that. I will start with your second question. I can’t really speak to any specific expectations of Ukraine and Russia, but what I can say is that the U.S. welcomes calls for diplomatic resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and measures Ukraine has proposed to lower tensions in and around Donbas to improve prospects or subsequent progress on the implementation of Minsk agreements. Of course, we stand ready to support sincere efforts and progress from all sides, including Ukraine, France, Germany, and Russia to implement Minsk agreements through the work in the Normandy Format.</p>
<p>To your first question on the Finlandization, I would say that President Macron has said that that was not the formulation that he used, and that ending NATO’s “Open Door” policy would actually be a problem, and we agree with that. And as we’ve said previously, we’re committed to the right of sovereign nations to make their own decisions about their security.</p>
<p>Okay, we can continue on to Christina, please.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you, CBS News.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Yes, your line is open.</p>
<p><a id="post-312922-Department"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, great. Good afternoon. I’m wondering – and I’m not saying or trying to imply that the security situation is at this level, but should Kyiv become unsafe, is there a plan to relocate the U.S. embassy somewhere else within the country or is the plan to simply close and evacuate the personnel? And could you facilitate that kind of operation with the security and staff you already have in the country? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Christina. We are preparing for a range of contingency plans, but for operational security reason I can’t get into those specific details from here today.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Michel Ghandour, please.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. That line is open.</p>
<p><a id="post-312922-Syria"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Jalina. I have two questions. The <em>Foreign Policy</em> has reported that the United States has quietly cut a deal with Russia that eases the political pressure on Syria at the United Nations, and the report said that if the 15-nation Security Council endorses the deal, the UN security body would hold fewer meetings on Syria’s chemical weapons and consolidate separate sessions on humanitarian relief and the political transition. Is this accurate? And if you have any comment on it.</p>
<p><a id="post-312922-IsraelLebanon"></a> And my second question is on Senior Advisor Hochstein’s visit to Beirut. Do you have any update? And news reports said that he offered or represented several ideas to the Lebanese officials to bridge the gap between Lebanon and Israel.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Michel. To your first question, I’d say that we continue to be highly engaged in pushing the Security Council to address the crisis in Syria across as many dimensions as possible. The Council’s program of work is a negotiation among all members of the Security Council. We’ve also been engaged in an effort to keep Syria on the agenda in the face of oppression from Russia and others on the Council. We’re fighting to maintain the international community’s focus on the conflict, and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>On your second question, we don’t have many updates from here, but I would just reiterate what we said in the past, in that the Senior Advisor for Global Energy Security continues to work diligently with the two governments, and of course that includes visits to the region. And any other updates we have, we’ll be sure to let you know at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Liz Kim, please.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. That line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. Thank you, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><a id="post-312922-NorthKoreaRegion"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Two questions for you. Coming Saturday, Secretary Blinken’s meeting with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Hawaii to discuss North Korea’s recent missile test. And last December, South Korean Secretary Chung Eui-yong told reporters that South Korea and the United States have agreed in principle on a draft to formally end the Korean War. And I was wondering if this is still the case even after a series of missile tests this year, and will the end of war declaration on the agenda for this Saturday meeting?</p>
<p>And my second question is North Korea’s foreign ministry just released a statement boasting that North Korea is the only country on the planet that can shake the world by firing a missile with the U.S. mainland in its range. Could you comment on that?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Liz. To your first question, I certainly won’t get ahead of the Secretary and his meetings. But what I can say from here is that we are committed to security in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>And to your second question, I don’t have anything to offer for you today.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Conor Finnegan.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. That line is open.</p>
<p><a id="post-312922-Iran3"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hey, sorry, I had myself on mute. Iran today unveiled or displayed a new long-range ballistic missile. I’m wondering if you have any response to that, and in particular given the administration’s stated position of trying to address Iran’s ballistic missile program down the line at some point with further talks, whether you take this as sort of a signal that they’re not willing to engage in those kinds of talks. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Conor. Well, I wouldn’t want to comment on their stature or any hypotheticals on if they are willing to talk or not. But what I can say is that Iran’s development and proliferation of ballistic missiles poses a threat to the international security and remains a significant nonproliferation challenge.</p>
<p>We continue to use a variety of nonproliferation tools to prevent and – further advancement of Iran’s missile program and its ability to proliferate technology to others. So an Iran with a nuclear weapon would likely act even more provocatively, and we’re committed to preventing this from happening.</p>
<p>Let’s go to the line of Dukin Han from Radio Free Asia.</p>
<p><a id="post-312922-NorthKorea"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, hello. Yes, thank you, Ms. Porter, and good afternoon.</p>
<p>With regard to North Korea, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said during the regular press conference today – to quote him, he said: “The DPRK has long faced external threats to security, which is the crux of the Korean Peninsula issue,” and when saying that, “If the U.S. truly cares about the well-being of the North Korean people, it should not keep pressuring the DPRK with sanctions. Instead it should face up to the denuclearization measures already taken by the DPRK, respond to its legitimate and reasonable concerns, and take measures to ease sanctions on the DPRK.”</p>
<p>My question is: What is your response to the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman’s remark, and what is the United States view on the denuclearization measures already taken by the DPRK so far? Is there anything worth mentioning at this point?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Dukin. Well, I would say to you what we said time and again before, which is our goal remains the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and we remain prepared to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy without preconditions to achieve that end and to make tangible progress.</p>
<p>Let’s take a final question from Poonam Sharma.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you, and that line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the U.S. group Sikhs for Justice, which calls itself an American human rights advocacy group. They announced a $250,000 bounty for information on the movements of an Indian general, Kuldeep Brar, who survived multiple assassination attempts and still receives death threats. I just wanted to get your comments on that. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Poonam. So we are not aware of these reports, but this is something I’m happy to take back to the team and get you a thorough response on.</p>
<p>Thank you all for joining today’s press briefing. I hope you have a wonderful week ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:22 p.m.)</p>

<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Liz. To your first question, I certainly won’t get ahead of the Secretary and his meetings. But what I can say from here is that we are committed to security in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>And to your second question, I don’t have anything to offer for you today.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Conor Finnegan.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. That line is open.</p>
<p><a id="post-312922-Iran3"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hey, sorry, I had myself on mute. Iran today unveiled or displayed a new long-range ballistic missile. I’m wondering if you have any response to that, and in particular given the administration’s stated position of trying to address Iran’s ballistic missile program down the line at some point with further talks, whether you take this as sort of a signal that they’re not willing to engage in those kinds of talks. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Conor. Well, I wouldn’t want to comment on their stature or any hypotheticals on if they are willing to talk or not. But what I can say is that Iran’s development and proliferation of ballistic missiles poses a threat to the international security and remains a significant nonproliferation challenge.</p>
<p>We continue to use a variety of nonproliferation tools to prevent and – further advancement of Iran’s missile program and its ability to proliferate technology to others. So an Iran with a nuclear weapon would likely act even more provocatively, and we’re committed to preventing this from happening.</p>
<p>Let’s go to the line of Dukin Han from Radio Free Asia.</p>
<p><a id="post-312922-NorthKorea"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, hello. Yes, thank you, Ms. Porter, and good afternoon.</p>
<p>With regard to North Korea, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said during the regular press conference today – to quote him, he said: “The DPRK has long faced external threats to security, which is the crux of the Korean Peninsula issue,” and when saying that, “If the U.S. truly cares about the well-being of the North Korean people, it should not keep pressuring the DPRK with sanctions. Instead it should face up to the denuclearization measures already taken by the DPRK, respond to its legitimate and reasonable concerns, and take measures to ease sanctions on the DPRK.”</p>
<p>My question is: What is your response to the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman’s remark, and what is the United States view on the denuclearization measures already taken by the DPRK so far? Is there anything worth mentioning at this point?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Dukin. Well, I would say to you what we said time and again before, which is our goal remains the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and we remain prepared to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy without preconditions to achieve that end and to make tangible progress.</p>
<p>Let’s take a final question from Poonam Sharma.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you, and that line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about the U.S. group Sikhs for Justice, which calls itself an American human rights advocacy group. They announced a $250,000 bounty for information on the movements of an Indian general, Kuldeep Brar, who survived multiple assassination attempts and still receives death threats. I just wanted to get your comments on that. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Poonam. So we are not aware of these reports, but this is something I’m happy to take back to the team and get you a thorough response on.</p>
<p>Thank you all for joining today’s press briefing. I hope you have a wonderful week ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:22 p.m.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh/ISIS remains resolutely committed to achieving the enduring defeat of ISIS.  Recent events in Syria underscore both the success we continue to have in degrading Daesh/ISIS leadership and the continuing threat the terrorist group poses in the region and beyond.</p>
<p>The removal of Daesh/ISIS leader Muhammad Said Abd al-Rahman al-Mawla, also known as Abd Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, from the battlefield was another significant blow to the terrorist organization.  We as a Coalition will sustain the necessary pressure to deny any Daesh/ISIS attempt to reconstitute or to retake and hold territory in Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p>The swift actions of our local partners &#8211; at the cost of casualties to their forces &#8211; to halt the attack against the Hasakah detention center denied Daesh/ISIS’s attempt to replenish its forces with detainees housed there.  The attack highlighted the vulnerability of temporary detention centers and the importance of fully resourcing Coalition initiatives to ensure the secure detention of ISIS fighters.</p>
<p>The enduring defeat of ISIS in Syria and Iraq remains the Coalition’s top priority.  We will continue to leverage the Coalition’s expertise to counter Daesh/ISIS’s global branches and networks, and to bring its members to justice.  We will use all available tools in the pursuit of that goal and we will not relent until ISIS no longer constitutes a threat.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program, administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $10 million each for information leading to the identification or location of ISIS-K leader Sanaullah Ghafari, also known as Shahab al-Muhajir, and for information leading to the arrest or conviction in any country of those responsible for the August 26, 2021, terrorist attack at the Kabul airport.</p>
<p>In June 2020, Sanaullah Ghafari was appointed by the ISIS core to lead ISIS-K. Ghafari is responsible for approving all ISIS-K operations throughout Afghanistan and arranging funding to conduct operations. On November 22, 2021, the Department of State designated Ghafari as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended.</p>
<p>On August 26, 2021, terrorists launched a suicide bombing against the airport as the United States and other governments conducted a large-scale evacuation of their citizens and vulnerable Afghans from the country. At least 185 people were killed in the attack, including 13 U.S. service members supporting evacuation operations. More than 150 people, including 18 U.S. service members, were wounded. ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
<p>On September 29, 2015, the U.S. government designated ISIS-K as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), and on January 14, 2016, the Department of State designated it a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO).</p>
<p>More information about this reward offer is located on the Rewards for Justice website at <a href="https://www.rewardsforjustice.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.rewardsforjustice.net</a>. We encourage anyone with information on past or planned attacks against U.S. persons or property in Afghanistan to text Rewards for Justice via Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp at +1-202-702-7843. All information will be kept strictly confidential.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1984, the program has paid more than $200 million to more than 100 people across the globe who provided actionable information that helped prevent terrorism, bring terrorist leaders to justice, and resolve threats to U.S. national security.
