					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><i>The following statement is issued by the United States as Chair of a Global Food Security Ministerial Meeting held at United Nations Headquarters and endorsed by Albania, Australia, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, France, Germany, Ghana, Guyana, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sweden, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Ukraine, and Yemen: </i></p>
<p><i>Begin Text:</i></p>
<p>We issue this Roadmap for Global Food Security&#8211;Call to Action to affirm our commitment to act with urgency, at scale, and in concert to respond to the urgent food security and nutrition needs of millions of people in vulnerable situations the world.  We commit to provide immediate humanitarian assistance, build resilience of those in vulnerable situations, support social protection and safety nets, and strengthen sustainable, resilient, and inclusive food systems in line with the objectives of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals, and the objectives of the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit.</p>
<p>We note with grave concern that the newly-released 2022 Global Report on Food Crises indicates that the number of people facing acute food insecurity greatly increased from 135 million in 2019 to 193 million in 2021 in the 53 countries most in need of assistance, and that nearly 40 million people across 36 countries experienced emergency levels of acute food insecurity, just one step away from famine.  Driven by conflicts, extreme climate-related events, such as historic multi-season droughts and floods; economic shocks, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on livelihoods, incomes, and food prices; and a multitude of other threats to human, animal and crop health, the food security outlook for 2022 and beyond is grim.  This is compounded by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which is further exacerbating this already dire situation.  We call on all United Nations Member States, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society and academia to urgently support the emergency response to address humanitarian needs and to also focus on building resilient and sustainable food systems particularly for those most vulnerable to food insecurity and malnutrition.</p>
<p>We reaffirm the vital role of the United Nations system, its implementing partners, and non-government organizations in responding to the global food security crisis, in particular through the work of the World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, International Fund for Agricultural Development, United Nations Children’s Fund, and the Global Network against Food Crises.  We strongly support the swift initiative of the UN Secretary-General in ensuring a coordinated and comprehensive response through the UN Secretariat’s Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance (GCRG).  We thank the UN Secretary-General for his consistent leadership to raise collective awareness and action on food security and food systems transformation.</p>
<p>We welcome the G7’s efforts under the German Presidency’s leadership to prioritize and respond to the escalating global food security crisis, most prominently the shaping of a Global Alliance for Food Security. We recall the G7 Famine Prevention Compact agreed during the United Kingdom Presidency and we look forward to addressing food security as a core component of social, economic, and environmental development under Indonesia’s G20 Presidency, recalling also the G20 Matera Declaration on Food Security, Nutrition and Food Systems promoted under the Italian G20 Presidency. We welcome the different initiatives taken by the African Union (AU) for the elimination of hunger and food insecurity in Africa under the Senegalese presidency’s leadership. In this regard, we recall the AU theme of the year 2022: Strengthening Resilience in Nutrition and Food Security on the African Continent: Strengthening Agro-Food Systems, Health and Social Protection Systems for the Acceleration of Human, Social and Economic Capital Development.” We take note of various other international initiatives, such as the Food and Agriculture Resilience Mission (FARM).</p>
<p>We welcome the commitment of the multilateral development banks and international financial institutions to combine their expertise and financing to quickly increase policy and financial support to countries and households vulnerable to the food security crisis and to increase domestic agricultural production in, and supply to, affected countries in line with a transition to sustainable food systems. We are pleased that these commitments have been encapsulated in the IFI Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity.</p>
<p>Recognizing that the impacts of and capacity to respond to global food insecurity are unevenly distributed across countries, and that conflicts, climate change, and macroeconomic shocks threaten global food security both immediately and into the future, we call on all UN Member States to commit to addressing immediate humanitarian needs and disruptions, including guaranteeing full, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access to populations in need.  We ask that UN Member States rapidly provide additional contributions to urgent humanitarian appeals to the areas most affected by acute hunger, which are experiencing the compound effects of multiple historic shocks and where the greatest number of lives are under immediate threat due to food insecurity and malnutrition.</p>
<p>We also call on all UN Member States to work together to mitigate the mid-term and long-term impacts of recent shocks to global agriculture and food systems.  We must collectively mitigate fertilizer shortages and the subsequent threat to food production, increase investments in agricultural capacity and resilience, buffer those in vulnerable situations from impacts to their food security, nutrition and well-being, and sustain high-level global political engagement on these critical issues.</p>
<p>As part of the Roadmap for Global Food Security&#8211;Call to Action, we call for the following actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>UN Member States with available resources to make new, additive financial donations to key humanitarian organizations providing immediate life-saving humanitarian assistance, including cash, food and nutrition supplies, health and nutrition programming, water and sanitation, and humanitarian protection to populations at the most severe risk, while at the same time strengthening their resilience to multiple shocks wherever possible.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>UN Member States with available resources, including those with large emergency food stockpiles, to provide in-kind donations and necessary associated costs to key humanitarian organizations for transportation and delivery of food commodities, based on assessed needs by governments of affected countries or humanitarian organizations.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>All UN Member States to keep their food and agricultural markets open and to avoid unjustified restrictive measures, such as export bans on food or fertilizer, which increase market volatility and threaten food security and nutrition at a global scale, especially among those in vulnerable situations already experiencing increased poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, and call on all members to ensure safe maritime transportation in the Black Sea.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>UN Member States with available resources to temporarily increase fertilizer production in order to compensate shortages, support fertilizer innovations and promote methods to maximize fertilizer efficiency, invest in diversifying sustainable production of fertilizers, and increase the use of residues as fertilizers to create longer-term supply chain resilience for this key input.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>UN Member States with available resources to increase efforts to support the sustainable transformation of agriculture and food systems to make them more resilient and available to smallholder farmers, and strengthen the infrastructure, logistical support, and innovation needed to cultivate, store, and distribute food.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>All UN Member States to increase their investments in research to develop and implement science-based and climate-resilient agricultural innovations, including seeds, that contribute to building sustainable and resilient agricultural sectors and food systems.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>All UN Member States and regional organizations to closely monitor markets affecting food systems, including futures markets, to ensure full transparency, and to share reliable and timely data and information on global food market developments, especially through the relevant international organizations.</li>
</ol>
<p>We note the many commitments made today in response to this Roadmap for Global Food Security&#8211;Call to Action and urge the mobilization of additional resources to implement this roadmap on an urgent basis.</p>
<p>We will regularly review actions outlined in this Roadmap for Global Food Security&#8211;Call to Action, and will coordinate commitments and their implementation with UN System agencies, the G7, G20, multilateral development banks and international financial institutions, and other partners as appropriate.</p>
<p>Enhanced coordination at country level is key, including to support the work of the GCRG in partner countries. We will step-up our efforts in this regard, including strengthened reporting concerning the actions and impact on the ground to avert further socio-economic shocks and risks.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>Ed Sullivan Theater</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Ladies and gentlemen, my guest tonight has worked in government for nearly 30 years and currently serves as our 71st Secretary of State.  Please welcome Secretary Antony Blinken.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>Thank you for being here.  I don’t take this lightly.  You don’t get a secretary of state on a late-night show every day.  (Cheers.)  Have you done many of these?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  This is the first one.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  This is the first one?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  It is.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  You’re going to love it.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>Now, I want to talk to you a little bit later about basically the State Department in general.  I think people misunderstand its mission often and how important it is.  But the first thing I want to talk to you about is that you’re the most informed person right now I could talk to about what’s going on in the war in Ukraine.  And – but before I ask you my questions, what would you like people to know about what the state of that conflict is right now?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Stephen, this is day 82 of what was an unprovoked, unjustified aggression by Russia against Ukraine.  And I think what the world already knows is we’ve seen the remarkable courage, resiliency of the Ukrainian people.  Overmatched – (cheers).</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Everyone said three or four days and it would be over.  Everyone thought it would be over in three or four days.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  There was a lot of expectation that that might happen.  But because of their courage, because of their resilience, but also because of the assistance that we’ve been able to provide them with dozens of other countries, they’ve not only held their ground, they’ve been pushing the Russians back.  They won the battle for Kyiv.</p>
<p>Now, there is an intense fight going on in eastern and southern Ukraine.  And the other thing is the country has been terribly brutalized by this Russian aggression.  We had that – the town of Bucha near Kyiv.  The Russians moved out.  When that tide receded, we saw what was left in its wake, and I’m afraid that as that happens in other parts of Ukraine, we’ll see it.</p>
<p>But the most important thing is this:  82 days in, the Ukrainians are standing up for their freedom.  They’re standing up for their sovereignty.  They have so much of the world with them.  And here’s what I can tell you:  What Vladimir Putin was trying to do was to take away their independence, their sovereignty.  In his mind, Ukraine is not an independent country; it needs to be subsumed into Russia.  That’s what this is about.</p>
<p>And what I think we can say with a lot of certainty and conviction is that a sovereign, independent Ukraine is going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene.  (Cheers.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Now, you were one of the first people to actually brief Zelenskyy before the war ever started about the likelihood of this invasion.  You were first to warn the public on behalf of the administration of what might be going over there.  You’re now leading the U.S. efforts to have a joint response from NATO countries and set the tone for the entire world.  All of that seems like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>One thing that worries me, however right I think the fight for the Ukrainians is, is that:  Is there a chance that this could tip over to a hot war with Russia?  Because certainly, Putin and all of his – the people in his circle have said they consider this a hot war with the West, whether or not we want to call it that.  So how do you make sure that that doesn’t happen?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Stephen, the President’s been very clear about this, about what this is and what it isn’t.  And what it isn’t is it isn’t a war with Russia.  This is the United States &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Not a proxy war.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  And it’s not a proxy war.  It’s about us giving the Ukrainians the help that they need to defend themselves, to stop the aggression, to hold onto their freedom, to hold onto their sovereignty.  That’s what we’re doing.  And we’re also putting pressure on Russia to try to get it to stop the aggression.  We have sanctions that we’ve been leading with dozens of other countries that are making life pretty difficult for the Russians.  More than 800 companies, big – the biggest brand names in the world – have left Russia because they don’t want the reputational cost of doing business there given this aggression.  That’s having a real impact.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Now, we see reports about the fall of Mariupol, and the Ukrainians fighters put up a fierce resistance there.  Now that that city – is that accurate, that Mariupol has fallen to the Russians?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The Russians have taken Mariupol.  It is &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What does that mean to the Russian efforts now?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The fight now is – after the Russians got pushed back from Kyiv and around Kyiv and from northern Ukraine and parts of western Ukraine, this has moved all the way east and all the way south, pretty near Russia itself.  And that’s what they’re – that’s what they’re fighting over.</p>
<p>And again, as I said, what’s so heartbreaking about this is when the world actually sees what’s happened in Mariupol, which it will one day, I’m afraid the pictures that we’ve seen coming out of Bucha a few – a couple months ago are going to be nothing by comparison.</p>
<p>So this is why I think people – and the American people have been incredibly generous, because – through Congress – so much support given to the Ukrainians, because I think it is touching people’s hearts.  They’re seeing a big country aggress a small one.  They’re seeing one country try to change the borders of another by force.  They’re seeing one country try to say to another country: we’re going to decide what your future’s going to be, not you.  And we can’t have a world that works that way.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And there’s a bipartisan response, which is &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  This has been remarkable.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Is unusual these days.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Anything that anyone can agree on.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  It’s been remarkable.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Part of Putin’s motivation for the war – as I see in the reporting that part of Putin’s motivation for the war is to weaken NATO.  Now, this was Monday and then Tuesday, Finland and then Sweden &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s right.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  &#8212; signed the applications.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s right.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Is Putin himself the greatest advertisement for NATO in a generation?  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  If I was going to have a poster for – well.  (Laughter.)  What’s remarkable is when you look at this, Stephen, President Putin has managed to precipitate everything he sought to prevent.  He wanted to prevent NATO from getting bigger with Ukraine.  Now it actually is with Finland and with Sweden.  He wanted to divide the West, divide the Alliance.  It’s more united than it’s ever been.  And as I said, he wanted to subjugate Ukraine, make it part of Russia.  That is not going to happen.  So everything we’re seeing is Putin achieving the exact opposite of what he says he wants.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Now, my buddy Pope Francis – (laughter) – has said that NATO takes some blame for this by basically stressing out Russia by expanding east up against Russia’s borders.  Do you think he’s got a case?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  So NATO &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I mean, he’s the Pope.  He’s the Pope.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  And I have great reverence for him.  I had the – now, he told me that you were very close when I saw him.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I have great reverence for him, but let me say this.  NATO is a defensive Alliance, countries coming together to make sure that if one of them was attacked all the others would come in and defend that country.  That’s what it’s about.  It has no aggressive intent against Russia.  It’s never attacked Russia; it won’t attack Russia.  It doesn’t intend to attack Russia.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I’ve got a crazy idea.  Invite Russia to be part of NATO.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Then what’s he got to be worried about?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  You know what?  Back in the 1990s that was actually something that people talked about.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>And?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b> Well, the Russians decided that wasn’t what they wanted to do.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Okay.  We have to take a quick break, but when we come back I will ask the Secretary about what Zelenskyy is like in person.  Stick around.</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hey, everybody.  We’re back here with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  You’ve met Zelenskyy.  After speaking to him many times, I assume, as Secretary of State, you went over there and visited with him over in Kyiv.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I did.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What’s he like?  He seems very impressive as a leader from a distance, but we know he was an actor and a comedian so he could just be acting impressive.  (Laughter.)  But what’s he like in person?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I’ve got to say, Stephen, he is – he is quite literally the embodiment of the courage of the Ukrainian people.  Because this is a guy who, when the bombs started coming in, the missiles started flying, he could have left town.  He could have gotten out of Kyiv.  He didn’t; he stayed.  He led his people.  And that’s both incredible personal courage, but it’s also because I think he felt that he had to represent Ukrainians, he had to stand up for the country’s freedom and independence.</p>
<p>So he’s really inspired people all around the world.  And I’ve had the occasion to meet him – meet with him half a dozen times.  Before the war, when we had this information that Russia was likely to do this, I had to tell him.  We were at the COP26, the climate meetings, and I sat with him and shared the information.  Telling someone that Russia may be about to invade your country is definitely an eye-opener, but he has proven to be remarkably resilient.</p>
<p>And of course, he’s also, I think, made a powerful fashion statement out of the green t-shirt.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>So when we visited – (applause).  When we visited, I went with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.  And if you’re going to go into a conflict zone with anyone, you want to go in with Lloyd Austin.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Because you can stand behind him.  He’s a huge man.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Yes, exactly.  He’s a big guy.  And we went and we had a remarkable three hours with President Zelenskyy, with his team.  We went in on this train that took about 12 hours to get from the Polish border into Kyiv.  And actually, Kyiv itself looks, now at least, remarkably normal – people on the streets going to coffee shops, et cetera.  Now, that doesn’t stop the Russians from still firing missiles that hit Kyiv, but the city has come back to life.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I understand that the embassy is going to reopen there.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The embassy – the flag went up today.  Embassy &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  The American flag.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  American flag.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What does that mean?  What’s the significance – well, two things.  What is the – and this will get us into what I want to talk to you about the State Department.  What is the significance of an embassy having to be evacuated and that moment of return?  What’s the significance of both those events?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  My first responsibility in this job as Secretary is to look out for the well-being of the men and women of the State Department.  I’ve got to have their security uppermost in mind.  So when the attack was coming, we had to make a really hard decision to suspend our operations and to get folks out of harm’s way.  Let me tell you this:  They didn’t want to go.  But we moved them to Poland.</p>
<p>They took the flag that was flying over the embassy that day with them, and that is the same flag that’s now flying over the embassy again in Kyiv today.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  We have to take a little break.  We’ll be right back with Secretary Antony Blinken, everybody.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hey, everybody.  We’re back here with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  We’re talking about a war, and we talked earlier about, like, the munitions that might go over and the tactical and intelligence help the United States may give.  But the State Department is not the Department of Defense; it’s not the Department of War.  Richard Holbrooke called it the department of peace.  And General Mattis said, “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.”</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s right.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What do people not understand about the mission of the State Department?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, you’ve got it exactly right.  Our job is to try to prevent war; if we fail at that, to try to make peace; and if we fail at that, to make sure that our diplomacy is doing everything it can wherever necessary not just to make life better for people around the world, but also to make life better for our own people, for the American people.  Because everything that we’re trying to do is to try to make the world just a little bit safer, a little bit more prosperous, a little bit healthier, a little bit wiser, a little bit more tolerant, and that’s going to benefit us.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What’s the state of the State Department right now?  We only have a minute here.  I’m just very curious.  It was sort of famously reported as being sort of denuded during the previous administration, that people who were leaving were not being replaced, that the halls were empty.  Is the State Department being restaffed?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, President Biden said early on, as we started to move around the world again, America’s back.  And I can tell you this:  The State Department’s back.  We have – our men and women throughout the world – (applause) – even as we’re relentlessly focused – relentlessly focused on Ukraine and on helping the Ukrainian people, we’re doing a lot of other things too.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten a truce in Ethiopia so that humanitarian assistance can get to people up in Tigray.  (Applause.)  We got a truce in Yemen after eight years of war so that there’s a chance at a lasting peace.  We’ve helped get now more than 500 million COVID vaccine shots to people around the world, on our way to 1.2 billion shots the United States is giving away free, no strings attached, so that we can get ahead of COVID around the world.  That’s the work we do every day.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing, Stephen.  What we know is this:  If the United States is not engaged, if we are not trying to lead, then one of two things.  Either someone else is – maybe it’s China, and that might not go forward in a way that reflects our interests and our values – or no one is, and that usually leaves a vacuum that’s filled by bad things before it’s filled by good things.  So that’s why it’s so important that we engage, that we lead, and we’re leading with diplomacy.  That’s what President Biden said he wanted.  That’s why the State Department is front and center.  That’s what we do.  We’re leading with diplomacy, we’re leading for America, and we’re trying to make things a little bit better around the world.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Well, thank you so much for being here.  As important as that work is that you just described, I think perhaps you’ll be – you’ll best be remembered as the lead guitarist for the band Ablinken.  (Laughter.)  And this is an actual photo.  We did not mock this up.  (Applause.)  Tell me about your band.  What do you get out of it and where are you guys gigging next?  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Stephen, I long wanted to be a musician.  As a kid, as a teenager, that’s what I wanted to do, and I see some real musicians over there.  (Laughter and applause.)  There was just one – one missing ingredient.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Yes.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Talent.  (Laughter.)  But it has been a constant thread in my life, so I’ve been in a bunch of “bands,” in quotation marks.  Coalition of the Willing.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Oh, sure, with András Simonyi, yeah, (inaudible), yes.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  With – yes, that’s right, among others.  Big Lunch.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Don’t know that one.  (Laughter.)  That’s on me.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Name because we kind of make you feel the way you do after you’ve had a big lunch.  (Laughter.)  A little bit drowsy.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Logy.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Exactly.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  A little logy.  Okay, sure.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  A little – exactly.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Logy dance band, yeah.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  And what we found – at least what I’ve found in my experience is that the best audience we have tends to be very young children who haven’t developed critical faculties.  (Laughter.)  That &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Well, just in case there are any of them watching right now, as we go out, would you care – do you guys have a guitar that the Secretary might be able to use?  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Secretary Blinken, thank you so much.  Antony Blinken, everybody.  We’ll be right back with a performance by Twice.  (Applause.)  Please, sir.  Won’t you, please.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>Ed Sullivan Theater</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Ladies and gentlemen, my guest tonight has worked in government for nearly 30 years and currently serves as our 71st Secretary of State.  Please welcome Secretary Antony Blinken.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>Thank you for being here.  I don’t take this lightly.  You don’t get a secretary of state on a late-night show every day.  (Cheers.)  Have you done many of these?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  This is the first one.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  This is the first one?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  It is.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  You’re going to love it.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>Now, I want to talk to you a little bit later about basically the State Department in general.  I think people misunderstand its mission often and how important it is.  But the first thing I want to talk to you about is that you’re the most informed person right now I could talk to about what’s going on in the war in Ukraine.  And – but before I ask you my questions, what would you like people to know about what the state of that conflict is right now?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Stephen, this is day 82 of what was an unprovoked, unjustified aggression by Russia against Ukraine.  And I think what the world already knows is we’ve seen the remarkable courage, resiliency of the Ukrainian people.  Overmatched – (cheers).</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Everyone said three or four days and it would be over.  Everyone thought it would be over in three or four days.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  There was a lot of expectation that that might happen.  But because of their courage, because of their resilience, but also because of the assistance that we’ve been able to provide them with dozens of other countries, they’ve not only held their ground, they’ve been pushing the Russians back.  They won the battle for Kyiv.</p>
<p>Now, there is an intense fight going on in eastern and southern Ukraine.  And the other thing is the country has been terribly brutalized by this Russian aggression.  We had that – the town of Bucha near Kyiv.  The Russians moved out.  When that tide receded, we saw what was left in its wake, and I’m afraid that as that happens in other parts of Ukraine, we’ll see it.</p>
<p>But the most important thing is this:  82 days in, the Ukrainians are standing up for their freedom.  They’re standing up for their sovereignty.  They have so much of the world with them.  And here’s what I can tell you:  What Vladimir Putin was trying to do was to take away their independence, their sovereignty.  In his mind, Ukraine is not an independent country; it needs to be subsumed into Russia.  That’s what this is about.</p>
<p>And what I think we can say with a lot of certainty and conviction is that a sovereign, independent Ukraine is going to be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene.  (Cheers.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Now, you were one of the first people to actually brief Zelenskyy before the war ever started about the likelihood of this invasion.  You were first to warn the public on behalf of the administration of what might be going over there.  You’re now leading the U.S. efforts to have a joint response from NATO countries and set the tone for the entire world.  All of that seems like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>One thing that worries me, however right I think the fight for the Ukrainians is, is that:  Is there a chance that this could tip over to a hot war with Russia?  Because certainly, Putin and all of his – the people in his circle have said they consider this a hot war with the West, whether or not we want to call it that.  So how do you make sure that that doesn’t happen?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Stephen, the President’s been very clear about this, about what this is and what it isn’t.  And what it isn’t is it isn’t a war with Russia.  This is the United States &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Not a proxy war.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  And it’s not a proxy war.  It’s about us giving the Ukrainians the help that they need to defend themselves, to stop the aggression, to hold onto their freedom, to hold onto their sovereignty.  That’s what we’re doing.  And we’re also putting pressure on Russia to try to get it to stop the aggression.  We have sanctions that we’ve been leading with dozens of other countries that are making life pretty difficult for the Russians.  More than 800 companies, big – the biggest brand names in the world – have left Russia because they don’t want the reputational cost of doing business there given this aggression.  That’s having a real impact.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Now, we see reports about the fall of Mariupol, and the Ukrainians fighters put up a fierce resistance there.  Now that that city – is that accurate, that Mariupol has fallen to the Russians?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The Russians have taken Mariupol.  It is &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What does that mean to the Russian efforts now?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The fight now is – after the Russians got pushed back from Kyiv and around Kyiv and from northern Ukraine and parts of western Ukraine, this has moved all the way east and all the way south, pretty near Russia itself.  And that’s what they’re – that’s what they’re fighting over.</p>
<p>And again, as I said, what’s so heartbreaking about this is when the world actually sees what’s happened in Mariupol, which it will one day, I’m afraid the pictures that we’ve seen coming out of Bucha a few – a couple months ago are going to be nothing by comparison.</p>
<p>So this is why I think people – and the American people have been incredibly generous, because – through Congress – so much support given to the Ukrainians, because I think it is touching people’s hearts.  They’re seeing a big country aggress a small one.  They’re seeing one country try to change the borders of another by force.  They’re seeing one country try to say to another country: we’re going to decide what your future’s going to be, not you.  And we can’t have a world that works that way.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And there’s a bipartisan response, which is &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  This has been remarkable.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Is unusual these days.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Anything that anyone can agree on.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  It’s been remarkable.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Part of Putin’s motivation for the war – as I see in the reporting that part of Putin’s motivation for the war is to weaken NATO.  Now, this was Monday and then Tuesday, Finland and then Sweden &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s right.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  &#8212; signed the applications.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s right.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Is Putin himself the greatest advertisement for NATO in a generation?  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  If I was going to have a poster for – well.  (Laughter.)  What’s remarkable is when you look at this, Stephen, President Putin has managed to precipitate everything he sought to prevent.  He wanted to prevent NATO from getting bigger with Ukraine.  Now it actually is with Finland and with Sweden.  He wanted to divide the West, divide the Alliance.  It’s more united than it’s ever been.  And as I said, he wanted to subjugate Ukraine, make it part of Russia.  That is not going to happen.  So everything we’re seeing is Putin achieving the exact opposite of what he says he wants.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Now, my buddy Pope Francis – (laughter) – has said that NATO takes some blame for this by basically stressing out Russia by expanding east up against Russia’s borders.  Do you think he’s got a case?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  So NATO &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I mean, he’s the Pope.  He’s the Pope.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  And I have great reverence for him.  I had the – now, he told me that you were very close when I saw him.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I have great reverence for him, but let me say this.  NATO is a defensive Alliance, countries coming together to make sure that if one of them was attacked all the others would come in and defend that country.  That’s what it’s about.  It has no aggressive intent against Russia.  It’s never attacked Russia; it won’t attack Russia.  It doesn’t intend to attack Russia.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I’ve got a crazy idea.  Invite Russia to be part of NATO.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Then what’s he got to be worried about?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  You know what?  Back in the 1990s that was actually something that people talked about.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>And?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </b> Well, the Russians decided that wasn’t what they wanted to do.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Okay.  We have to take a quick break, but when we come back I will ask the Secretary about what Zelenskyy is like in person.  Stick around.</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hey, everybody.  We’re back here with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  You’ve met Zelenskyy.  After speaking to him many times, I assume, as Secretary of State, you went over there and visited with him over in Kyiv.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I did.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What’s he like?  He seems very impressive as a leader from a distance, but we know he was an actor and a comedian so he could just be acting impressive.  (Laughter.)  But what’s he like in person?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I’ve got to say, Stephen, he is – he is quite literally the embodiment of the courage of the Ukrainian people.  Because this is a guy who, when the bombs started coming in, the missiles started flying, he could have left town.  He could have gotten out of Kyiv.  He didn’t; he stayed.  He led his people.  And that’s both incredible personal courage, but it’s also because I think he felt that he had to represent Ukrainians, he had to stand up for the country’s freedom and independence.</p>
<p>So he’s really inspired people all around the world.  And I’ve had the occasion to meet him – meet with him half a dozen times.  Before the war, when we had this information that Russia was likely to do this, I had to tell him.  We were at the COP26, the climate meetings, and I sat with him and shared the information.  Telling someone that Russia may be about to invade your country is definitely an eye-opener, but he has proven to be remarkably resilient.</p>
<p>And of course, he’s also, I think, made a powerful fashion statement out of the green t-shirt.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>So when we visited – (applause).  When we visited, I went with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.  And if you’re going to go into a conflict zone with anyone, you want to go in with Lloyd Austin.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Because you can stand behind him.  He’s a huge man.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Yes, exactly.  He’s a big guy.  And we went and we had a remarkable three hours with President Zelenskyy, with his team.  We went in on this train that took about 12 hours to get from the Polish border into Kyiv.  And actually, Kyiv itself looks, now at least, remarkably normal – people on the streets going to coffee shops, et cetera.  Now, that doesn’t stop the Russians from still firing missiles that hit Kyiv, but the city has come back to life.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I understand that the embassy is going to reopen there.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The embassy – the flag went up today.  Embassy &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  The American flag.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  American flag.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  What does that mean?  What’s the significance – well, two things.  What is the – and this will get us into what I want to talk to you about the State Department.  What is the significance of an embassy having to be evacuated and that moment of return?  What’s the significance of both those events?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  My first responsibility in this job as Secretary is to look out for the well-being of the men and women of the State Department.  I’ve got to have their security uppermost in mind.  So when the attack was coming, we had to make a really hard decision to suspend our operations and to get folks out of harm’s way.  Let me tell you this:  They didn’t want to go.  But we moved them to Poland.</p>
<p>They took the flag that was flying over the embassy that day with them, and that is the same flag that’s now flying over the embassy again in Kyiv today.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  We have to take a little break.  We’ll be right back with Secretary Antony Blinken, everybody.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hey, everybody.  We’re back here with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  We’re talking about a war, and we talked earlier about, like, the munitions that might go over and the tactical and intelligence help the United States may give.  But the State Department is not the Department of Defense; it’s not the Department of War.  Richard Holbrooke called it the department of peace.  And General Mattis said, “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.”</p>

<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  Welcome.  Thank you all so much for being here today.</p>
<p>We meet during what is the greatest global food security crisis of our time.  It’s a crisis that we all know has been building for years, driven in part by the pandemic, driven by an accelerating climate crisis.  Between 2016 and 2021, the number of people living in acute food insecurity, the level when a person’s inability to consume adequate food puts their lives or livelihoods in immediate danger, that has skyrocketed from 108 million people to 161 million people around the world.</p>
<p>It was this growing crisis that led Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield to make the nexus between food security and conflict the focus of a UN Security Council meeting that she chaired in March of last year.  And it’s why the United States made robust commitments at the secretary-general’s UN Food Systems Summit last September.</p>
<p>All of that – all of that was before the Russian Government’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which, according to the World Bank, may drive 40 million additional people worldwide into extreme poverty and food insecurity this year.  Indeed, every driver of the crisis that we’ll discuss today has been made worse by President Putin’s war of choice.</p>
<p>That’s why we thought it was so important to convene this high-level group to put a brighter spotlight on the devastating impact of this crisis and to marshal the global effort that is needed to address it.  This is something we’re intently focused on every day at the State Department and across the United States Government.  But it’s a crisis that demands a global response.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I’ll have the opportunity to lead a session in the Security Council on how conflicts like this one are fueling food insecurity and how rising food insecurity is threatening peace and security around the globe, problems that we have to tackle as parts of a whole.  Today, in our gathering, we want to focus on what we can do to save lives now and address the long-term drivers of this problem.</p>
<p>I’ll start by offering four suggestions, at least on the part of the United States, about what we can do.  But having said that, this meeting is really about hearing the perspectives of a range of colleagues and countries, both on how this crisis is affecting lives in your respective countries but also on what we can do together to address it.</p>
<p>First, from our perspective, we need countries to step up with substantial new contributions to fill the gaps faced by humanitarian organizations and agencies that are battling food insecurity which are forcing humanitarian groups to make incredibly wrenching decisions about when and where to cut lifesaving assistance.  The cost of doing business for vital organizations like the World Food Program, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNICEF, and others – the cost of doing business is going up.  We have to help them continue to do their business.</p>
<p>In particular, as well, countries with significant grain and fertilizer reserves as well as those with financial resources need to step up and do it fast.  The United States has announced more than $2.3 billion in new funding for emergency food assistance to meet global humanitarian needs since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Today, given the urgency of the crisis, we’re announcing another $215 million in new emergency food assistance.  And we’ll do much more.  We expect our Congress very soon to approve approximately $5.5 billion in additional funding for humanitarian assistance and food security.</p>
<p>Governments and international organizations can also come together to compel the Russian Federation to create corridors so that food and other vital supplies can safely leave Ukraine by land or by sea.  There are an estimated 22 million tons of grain sitting in silos in Ukraine right now, food that could immediately go toward helping those in need if it can simply get out of the country.</p>
<p>Second, we believe we must address the global fertilizer shortage.  Consider Africa, where the cost of fertilizer has already quadrupled since the start of the pandemic and has skyrocketed further since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  One way to address this is by creating incentives for countries to produce more fertilizer as the United States is doing by committing $500 million to boost U.S. production.  We can also help farmers maximize fertilizer efficiency learning from advances made by countries like Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Some have tried to blame the sanctions imposed on Russian – on the Russian Federation by the United States and many other countries for worsening this crisis.  This is false.  When we imposed sanctions on Russia in order to end the war as quickly as possible, we deliberately and carefully created exceptions for agricultural goods and fertilizer.  We’re working every day to get countries any information or assistance they need to ensure that sanctions are not preventing food or fertilizer from leaving Russia or anywhere else.</p>
<p>As with its decision to start this unjustified war, responsibility for the disruption of these supplies and the suffering that it’s causing around the world lies squarely and solely with the Russian Government.</p>
<p>Third, we believe we must increase investments in agricultural capacity and resilience.  That’s what the United States is doing through our Feed the Future program, which will invest $5 billion in more than 35 countries over five years, as well as our longstanding support of international agricultural research centers.  It’s also the focus of the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate<a title="" href="#1" name="m_-488744187024392686__ftnref1"></a>, which we launched a year ago with the United Arab Emirates to try to turbocharge investment in climate-smart agriculture.</p>
<p>Fourth, we believe that we have to help poor and vulnerable populations bear the colossal impact of this crisis.  International financial institutions have a critical role to play in doing this.  That’s why our Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen convened a session with the leadership of the international financial institutions just a few weeks ago and pushed for the development of the International Financial Institution Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity, which was released on the margins of today’s G7 financial ministerial.</p>
<p>Finally, if we want to save lives, we all have to be willing to shoulder added risk.  Last week, President Biden traveled to a family farm in Illinois.  He talked about how farms like the one he visited are working to double crop, harvesting two crops from the same field in the same year.  Now, this is something that doesn’t always work.  The growing seasons are short.  Weather doesn’t always cooperate.  But as the President said, that’s a risk we have to take.  So our government is working to provide additional insurance for American farmers who are willing to give it a try.</p>
<p>If we take these steps together – meeting the urgent need for food, fertilizer, and financing; investing more in the resilience of agriculture and vulnerable populations – we will meet this crisis, we’ll help prevent others like it, most important, we will save countless lives.  That’s what’s at stake, but I’m convinced that if we come together, we can address this challenge.</p>
<p>So thank you so much again for being here.  It’s now an honor and a privilege to give the floor to the secretary-general, who has been a leader in rallying the response to this crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary-General.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New York, New York</p>
<p>United Nations Headquarters</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong> Hello.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Very good to be here with my friend, the Turkish prime minister<a title="" href="#1" name="_ftnref1" shape="rect"></a>.  Mevlüt and I were just together at the NATO Ministerial.  I’m looking forward to pursuing that conversation.  Today we had Finland and Sweden submit their applications, and this of course is a process, and we will work through that process as Allies and as partners.</p>
<p>We have a lot on our common agenda, including, of course, Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine.  The United States, Turkey, all of our allies have been resolute in support of Ukraine, and we want to see this Russian aggression come to an end.  I’m grateful for the solidarity that we’ve shown, that Turkey has shown in that effort.</p>
<p>There are many other challenges that we’re the dealing with together and maybe some opportunities, including the South Caucasus.  We’ll have an opportunity to talk about that.  And we want to talk about continuing to strengthen and build on our economic relationship and partnership.  Actually, we’ve reached record levels of trade here despite COVID, despite other challenges.  We want to build on that.</p>
<p>Finally, we’re both here because we feel acutely the challenge of food insecurity, a challenge that has been with us for some time.  Again, COVID, climate contributed, but also conflict, including, again, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.  So we’re going to spend some time both together and then with our colleagues talking about the steps that we can take in the near term to help alleviate food insecurity as well as some of the more medium-term and longer-term steps to build a stronger system.</p>
<p>With that, Mevlüt, good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER ÇAVUŞOĞLU:</strong>  Thank you.  Thank you, Tony.  Very good to see you, too, after our pull-aside in Berlin on the occasion of NATO informal ministerial.  And always a pleasure to discuss bilateral relations and regional and global issues with you directly.  Therefore, I’m very happy that we are going to convene the first Strategic Mechanism Ministerial today as well.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER ÇAVUŞOĞLU:</strong>  Of course, we will focus on our bilateral relationships, and we are aiming to overcome the differences through dialogue and diplomacy.  And there are areas that we need to also pay attention or focus to further deepen our bilateral relations and cooperation.</p>
<p>And you mentioned trade.  Yes, we aim to reach $100 million trade volume, and the increase in 2021 despite the pandemic actually made us more hopeful to reach that target.  And the developments and Russian aggression in Ukraine showed once again that as allies and friends, Turkey and the U.S. should have better cooperation.  This is the expectation of not only our nation, but also the friends and allies in our region and beyond.</p>
<p>And two new challenges that we are facing today – actually, ongoing one, the migration, and the food security.  And I’m very grateful to you to organize a session here in New York on food security, and also we will be addressing tomorrow at the global refugee review.</p>
<p>Yes, we see the threat in our region, and that’s the reason we see that Finland and Sweden want to be NATO member, new member.  You know, Tony, Turkey has been supporting the “Open Door” policy of NATO even before this war.  But with regards to these possible candidates – or already candidate countries – we have also legitimate security concerns that they had been supporting terrorist organizations.  And there are also export restrictions on defense products.</p>
<p>So we already express our concerns.  And I had a candid and direct talk with two colleagues, Ann and Pekka, in Berlin.  So what I am trying to say, we understand their security concerns, but Turkey’s security concerns should be also met.  And this is also one of – one issue that we should continue discussing with friends and allies, including United States.</p>
<p>So looking forward have a result-oriented and fruitful discussion today with you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks, Mevlüt.  (Inaudible.)</p>

<p>Secretary Blinken emphasized the United States is focused on partnering with African nations to address the growing concern of food insecurity on the continent, which has been worsened by climate-induced drought, COVID-19-related supply chain disruption, and the global impact of the Kremlin&#8217;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.  They discussed how each of their countries are working to meet domestic food supply needs and ways the United States can collaborate to bolster those efforts.</p>

<p>Secretary Blinken emphasized the United States is focused on partnering with African nations to address the growing concern of food insecurity on the continent, which has been worsened by climate-induced drought, COVID-19-related supply chain disruption, and the global impact of the Kremlin&#8217;s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.  They discussed how each of their countries are working to meet domestic food supply needs and ways the United States can collaborate to bolster those efforts.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Three months ago, we lowered our flag over the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, just days before Russian forces streamed across Ukraine’s border to carry out President Putin’s unprovoked, unjustified war of choice.  When we suspended operations at the embassy, we made the point clear: while we would relocate U.S. embassy personnel for their safety and security, this would in no way prevent our engagement with, and support for, the Ukrainian people, government, and civil society as well as our allies and partners.  We underscored our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, pledged to continue our assistance, and started working toward the day we could return to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Now, that day has come. Today we are officially resuming operations at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.  The Ukrainian people, with our security assistance, have defended their homeland in the face of Russia’s unconscionable invasion, and, as a result, the Stars and Stripes are flying over the Embassy once again. We stand proudly with, and continue to support, the government and people of Ukraine as they defend their country from the Kremlin’s brutal war of aggression.</p>
<p>As we take this momentous step, we have put forward additional measures to increase the safety of our colleagues who are returning to Kyiv and have enhanced our security measures and protocols.</p>
<p>We are committed to confronting the challenges ahead.  The war rages on.  Russia&#8217;s forces inflict death and destruction on Ukrainian soil every day.  Millions of Ukrainians are displaced from their homes and mourn the loss of their loved ones.  With strength of purpose, we reaffirm our commitment to the people and government of Ukraine, and we look forward to carrying out our mission from the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New York, New York</p>
<p>United Nations Headquarters</p>
<p><b>AMBASSADOR THOMAS-GREENFIELD:  </b>Good morning, everyone.  Let me thank you, every one of you, for joining us today to open up a dialogue about a wide range of shared issues, particularly on climate, conflict, prosperity, and on food security.  We also want to talk to you about how we can strengthen our partnership here at the UN.</p>
<p>I recently had a series of meetings that I call listening tours with African ambassadors here at the UN, and in those meetings, I heard loud and clear that people in Africa are hurting from food and fuel price surges that have been exacerbated by Russia’s war on Ukraine.  As you know, the United States is making food security a core focus of our presidency of the Security Council for the second year in a row, and right now we’re hosting a series of Days of Action to bring this crisis to the forefront.</p>
<p>When I first raised this issue in the Security Council in March of 2021, we discussed how COVID, climate, conflict, and strained global supply chains were driving millions more people closer to hunger and malnutrition.  In recent months, the war in Ukraine, a major supplier of wheat and other agricultural commodities, has further disrupted global food supplies.  And let me just note that we have a very strong statement, a roadmap for action, that we encourage you all to sign as a concrete outcome of the food security ministerial later today.</p>
<p>This meeting is an opportunity.  It’s an opportunity for us to hear directly from you at the highest levels about this issue and so much more.  We want to know what you are seeing and experiencing on the ground, and how we can find ways to work together on a path forward.</p>
<p>To that end, I now have the great privilege of introducing the United States Secretary of State, Secretary Blinken.  I’m so grateful he took the time out of his busy schedule to bring us together here today, and I know he’s looking forward to hearing from all of you what you all have to say.  Secretary Blinken, the floor is yours.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Linda, thank you very, very much, both for the words of introduction but especially for everything you’re doing every single day here at the United Nations to represent the United States so effectively, including with so many of our partners around the table today.  And I want to extend the same thanks to our Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Molly Phee, for her constant leadership and engagement with the countries of Africa, with the people of Africa, with the institutions of Africa.</p>
<p>And I just want to pick up at the – on something, Linda, you just said, which is I really am here, we are here today to listen, to hear from you, because we want to know how you are experiencing this acute challenge of food insecurity, and especially ideas for how we can work together to address it.  So, I’m grateful to all of you for joining us today, those who will come in shortly.  It means a great deal to have the opportunity to spend some time in person.  Looking forward to the ministerial very soon.</p>
<p>Any conversation about food security has to focus on what’s happening across Africa.  Your countries are bearing some of the heaviest burdens.  It’s something we see, we recognize.  No one knows better than you what solutions would help, and which might fall short.  There are many reasons for the current food crisis.  Linda alluded to some of them, including, of course, the economic ramifications of COVID-19, the accelerated climate crisis which all of us are feeling acutely and which people across Africa have been experiencing firsthand for a long time.  Right now, the countries in the Horn of Africa are experiencing a brutal fourth consecutive drought season with, we know, devastating consequences.</p>
<p>And, as Linda said, Russia’s war in Ukraine has also had a major effect.  We had a preexisting condition that’s been significantly exacerbated by this aggression, and an additional 40 million people are believed as a result to be at risk of food insecurity.  We’ve seen global food shortages and rising prices for food, fertilizer, for fuel.  And while people worldwide are now dealing with these shortages and dealing with the high prices, people across Africa, we know, have been hit particularly hard.  There was a recent study by our U.S. Agency for International Development that found that 32 of the 39 countries at greatest risk from this acute food crisis are in Africa.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize something because it really is important, and I know it firsthand – I can attest to this firsthand.  The United States held hundreds of engagements to try to prevent this senseless war against Ukraine.  We reached out repeatedly to our Russian partners, to NATO, the African Union, the European Union, other allies and partners.  President Putin invaded anyway.  The sanctions that dozens of countries have imposed on Russia after the invasion included very clear carveouts for food, for fertilizer, for seeds.  But the Kremlin has chosen to deliberately hold back these exports from Ukraine.  There’s an abundance of grain, of wheat that was produced this year in Ukraine; it is just sitting there because it cannot get out of the country.  Why can’t it get out of the country?  Because Russia is blockading the ports from which it would leave and targeting, indeed, those ports, targeting farms and the lands for cultivation.  Ukrainian farmers in many cases have been forced into a choice of either fighting for the freedom of their country or fleeing.</p>
<p>All of this together has had a major impact.  And because Ukraine is one of the world’s top exporters of key crops, including corn, as well as wheat, seeds for cooking oil, the result that we’re seeing is that people around the world are suffering the consequences of choices that President Putin has made, and especially, again, people across Africa.  So, that’s why it’s critical that we get together today so that we can hear directly from you what your citizens are actually dealing with and how we can help.  For example, if there is specific assistance that countries need to ensure that sanctions don’t prevent the flow of food or fertilizer to you, we want to know. And we’re ready to act fast to help.</p>
<p>When I had the opportunity to visit Kenya and Nigeria and Senegal in November, I talked about how the United States sees the countries of Africa as partners in solving the challenges that we face.  Food security is one of the most urgent of those challenges, and simply put, we want to partner with you on a coordinated response.</p>
<p>So, let me just very briefly summarize what we’ve committed to do to try to end the near-term crisis as well as focus on the long term, and then we’re extremely anxious to hear from each of you.</p>
<p>First, we’re addressing the humanitarian needs caused by the war of aggression against Ukraine.  Just since February, the United States has pledged more than $2.3 billion of food assistance.  And pending final approval from our Congress, we’ll provide more than 5 billion in additional aid, including more than $760 million specifically for global food security.  Plus, today we’re announcing an additional $215 million for emergency food assistance in Algeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Mauritania, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Kenya, among other countries.</p>
<p>Second, we are working to alleviate what is also a global fertilizer shortage, including by boosting our domestic production.  President Biden committed an additional $250 million just a week ago for a total of $500 million invested in American fertilizer production this year.</p>
<p>Finally, we’re focused on building agricultural resilience over the long term.  And here I really want to commend the great work of the African Development Bank with its $1 billion plan to help 40 million African farmers use climate-resilient technologies and increase crop yields.  Likewise, we have our Feed the Future initiative that’s focused for 15 years on creating long-term improvements to food security, including with partners across Africa.  We’re growing Feed the Future with another $5 billion over the next three years and expanding it to new countries, including, indeed, primarily in Africa.</p>
<p>These investments show that global food security is a priority for the United States, and we want to do all that we can to coordinate and cooperate with our partners to help countries with the most urgent needs get the relief that they need fast while investing in their own food production.</p>
<p>Most important, we know that we do not have all the answers, and we certainly are not in the position of dictating solutions from afar.  We’re eager to hear, again, what we can do, what we can do better, how we can do it more effectively, understand how the crisis is really affecting your countries, and especially, again, get your ideas for how to solve it and how we can help.</p>
<p>So, with that said, I’m very, very grateful for everyone’s participation today, and let’s open it up for conversation.</p>
