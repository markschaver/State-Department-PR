					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The undersigned members of the Media Freedom Coalition express their deep concern at the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese authorities’ attacks on freedom of the press and their suppression of independent local media in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Recent developments include the raid of Stand News offices, the arrests of its staff, and the subsequent self-closure of Citizen News, stemming from concern over the safety of its staff. Since the enactment of the National Security Law in June 2020, authorities have targeted and suppressed independent media in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. This has eroded the protected rights and freedoms set out in the Basic Law and undermines China’s obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. This has also caused the near-complete disappearance of local independent media outlets in Hong Kong. These ongoing actions further undermine confidence in Hong Kong’s international reputation through the suppression of human rights, freedom of speech and free flow and exchange of opinions and information.</p>
<p>A stable and prosperous Hong Kong in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are protected should be in everybody’s interest. We urge Hong Kong and mainland Chinese authorities to respect freedom of the press and freedom of speech in Hong Kong, in line with the Basic Law and China’s obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration.</p>
<p><em>Signed by the Governments of Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States.</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:36 p.m. EST</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon. One element at the top, and then we’ll go ahead and get started with your questions.</p>
<p>The United States is deeply concerned by <a id="post-312152-TUNISIA"></a>Tunisian President Saied’s calls to dissolve the Supreme Judicial Council, and the reported barring of employees from entering the Supreme Judicial Council.</p>
<p>An independent judiciary is a core element of an effective and transparent democracy.</p>
<p>It is essential that the Government of Tunisia uphold its commitments to respect the independence of the judiciary as stipulated in the constitution.</p>
<p>The United States reiterates our calls for an accelerated political reform process in Tunisia that responds to the aspirations of the Tunisian people through the inclusion of diverse voices representing political parties, civil society and unions, particularly in the ongoing national consultations, and that ensures the continued respect for Tunisia’s human rights.</p>
<p>At this critical time, we also urge the Government of Tunisia to prioritize implementing the economic reforms required to stabilize the financial situation and address Tunisia’s growing economic challenges.</p>
<p>With that, happy to take your questions. Matt.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks, Ned. So I realize that <a id="post-312152-UKRAINERUSSIAREGION"></a>Ukraine is still the flavor of the day, but I don’t really have anything big on Ukraine, so I will – after I ask my first very brief initial question I’ll defer to others on Ukraine because I want to go to Iran.</p>
<p>Just on Ukraine, the joint statement – I realize that in the press conference the Secretary and Mr. Borrell spoke about Russia, but I’m just wondering why there was no mention of Russia at all in the joint statement from the EU-U.S. Energy Council meeting. I mean, it wasn’t – the word wasn’t even in there.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, the word Ukraine certainly was. There was a &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, it was.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> There was a robust discussion of Ukraine. There was a robust discussion of the contingency planning that we’re doing in the event that Russia does not choose the path of diplomacy, does not choose the path of dialogue. And as the joint statement noted, the council reiterated that it is unacceptable to use energy supplies as a weapon or geopolitical lever. This is what we have been saying all along, and much of the discussion today between the Secretary and between the high representative was part and parcel of the contingency planning that we’ve been doing for some time now.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. But what – I mean, was there a reason that Russia is not mentioned in there? I mean presumably, yes, it’s obvious that the threat to European energy security is coming from Russia. They are the main supplier and this is – but I’m just wondering why it wasn’t mentioned. Was there some objection to it being mentioned, or was it – did it ever come up in the discussions?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I am not aware there was any substantive reason for it. It’s a question of syntax.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> All right. Then I will pass and &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But I do want to – I have a couple important ones on Iran.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’m sure we’ll get there. Daphne.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Senior U.S. officials are in Europe this week coordinating sanctions and export control measures that can be used in the event that Russia invades Ukraine. Is the U.S. looking for commitments from counterparts during this trip on what action will be taken if Russia invades, and will Nord Stream 2 be part of discussions?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So, Daphne, what we spoke about earlier was the fact that we continue to take part in robust and to lead robust coordination and consultation with our European partners and allies on the consequences that would befall Moscow if it chooses the path of aggression. We have been consulting very closely with our allies and our partners over the course not of weeks but really of months now, and that includes the package that would respond to Russian aggression.</p>
<p>And so as you alluded to, today a U.S. delegation that included officials from Treasury and from the Department of State, including the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes Elizabeth Rosenberg, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration Assistant Secretary Rozman Kendler, Deputy Assistant Secretary here at the State Department Molly Montgomery, traveling to Europe to discuss technical coordination. And so over the past several weeks and even longer, we have discussed at a strategic level what we would – what the consequences that would befall Moscow were it choose – were it to choose this path.</p>
<p>There have been very detailed discussions in the context of that. Beyond the broad top lines there are a myriad of details and technical matters that will need to be worked out if we are in the unfortunate position of having to move forward with this strong and unified response. And so what you – what our team from the State Department, from the Department of Commerce, from the Department of Treasury are doing is meeting with their counterparts and European interlocutors to have those – to continue, I should say, those technical discussions to ensure that across the board we’re ready to go should, again, we be in the unfortunate position of needing to mobilize this response.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And will <a id="post-312152-NORDSTREAM"></a>Nord Stream 2 be a part of that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I don’t know if it’ll be part of these specific discussions. What I can say is that, of course, the President is meeting with Chancellor Scholz today at the White House. Leading up to this meeting we have had a number of discussions with our German allies on energy security broadly, on Nord Stream 2 specifically, both in the context of what we’re seeing from Russia and beyond.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Ned. Good to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. I have a few questions on South Korea, China, and North Korea. First of all, on South Korea: South Korea Government frequently fails to participate in the UN Security Council statement condemning North Korea’s missile provocations or ignored North Korea’s human rights issues. How does the U.S. evaluate South Korea’s attitude?</p>
<p>The second one, on China. After the UN Security Council meeting last week, the Chinese ambassador to the UN has blamed United States for the recent missile launch by North Korea. As you know, the South Korea – and I’m sorry, he has insisted that the U.S. should take more flexible approach, as in you know South – North Korea and China and Russia are strategically the same body. What is the United States position on China justifying North Korea’s missile provocations?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> <a id="post-312152-SOUTHKOREANORTHKOREA"></a>So let me take your first question first. As you know, since the start of this administration we have been investing heavily in our alliances and partnerships around the globe, and of course, that includes in the Indo-Pacific. There are a number of shared challenges and shared opportunities we have with our allies in the Indo-Pacific, of course, our treaty allies Japan and the ROK among them. And among those challenges are the DPRK, maybe one of the more – certainly is one of the more pressing challenges we have with those allies.</p>
<p>In recent days, the deputy secretary, the – our Special Representative for the DPRK Sung Kim, they have engaged their South Korean, their ROK, and Japanese counterparts. And as I think you know, this evening we’ll be departing for Australia, where we will see our Japanese counterparts in the context of the Quad – there will be a bilateral engagement there – before we then go by way of Fiji to Hawaii, where we’ll engage in a trilateral discussion with our South Korean and Japanese counterparts. And I think you – I can be confident that one of the priority issues of discussion in that setting will be the recent provocations we’ve seen from the DPRK, including its missile launches.</p>
<p>We know that when it comes to the fulfillment and the achievement of any progress towards our overriding goal, one of the indispensable ingredients is close coordination with our allies and partners. And the Japan – Japan and ROK are, of course, two of our allies with whom we work with most closely on this challenge. We know that that bilateral coordination is important, but we also know that trilateral coordination between the United States, Japan, and the ROK really is and will be indispensable if we are to achieve progress. It’s also a priority for our allies, Japan and the ROK, because of the threat that the DPRK poses not only to Americans in the region, potentially to deployed forces, but also to our treaty allies Japan and the ROK. So it’s something we take extraordinarily seriously and we know they do as well.</p>
<p>When it comes to – and this gets to your second question – our approach to the <a id="post-312152-NORTHKOREA"></a><a id="post-312152-PALESTINIANS"></a>DPRK, look, if you want to assign responsibility for the DPRK’s provocations, for the potential threats to international peace and security we’ve seen emanate from the DPRK, the only party that deserves blame, the only party that can be assigned culpability, is the DPRK. We have made very clear that we have no hostile intent towards the DPRK. We have made very clear that we wish to engage in dialogue and diplomacy. We have made very clear that we believe that only through dialogue and diplomacy can we most effectively achieve what, again, is our overriding policy objective, and that’s the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Follow-up, quick questions. North Korea has been engaged in peace process dialogue with the United States and South Korea in the past, while on the other hand it has been accelerating its – has been North Korea military buildup work. What is the ultimate tool for the United States besides diplomatic compromise to block North Korea global threat?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, the ultimate tool is diplomacy, and we know that previous administrations have tried this. No administration has been successful, despite undertaking strategies that, in many cases, look very different from one another. And so the strategy we have is not akin to the strategy that the last administration had. It is not also exactly akin to the strategy that the Obama administration had. It is a strategy that the Biden-Harris administration has put forward after an intense policy review, and a policy review that determined that, through diplomacy and dialogue, it is our hope that there can be incremental progress – incremental progress towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we have not yet found a willing partner in Pyongyang to engage in that dialogue, but we have continued even in the absence of substantive engagement from the DPRK to coordinate closely with Japan, with the ROK, other allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, but also allies and partners around the world, which you have seen us do in the UN, which you’ve seen us do in Europe, and elsewhere as we take on this challenge.</p>
<p>Said.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you. Can I go to the Palestinian issue?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I have a couple questions on settler violence on Omar Assad. <a id="post-312152-ISRAELPAL"></a> But before that, the White House issued a statement saying that President Biden is going to go and visit Israel later this year. Is he likely to also go – I mean, I know this is a White House probably question, but do you think that he will also make a detour to, like, Bethlehem or Ramallah 20 minutes away?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, Said, as you alluded to, the readout of the conversation between President Biden and Prime Minister Bennett did make a reference to President Biden’s intent to travel to the region later this year. Obviously, this was just announced yesterday, so I wouldn’t want to get into the itinerary at this point. In any case, I’d need to refer you to the White House.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I understand. Ned, I mean, you – almost every week, you come – you state opposition or displeasure with settler violence activities and so on. And I mean, in the last four days, I could cite a number of issues. I don’t want to go through them all – I mean, the Israelis – from home demolishing to attacks on the Al-Aqsa Mosque to poisoning of wells. I mean, all kinds of things, a whole – across the gamut. When will you guys issue a very strong statement and say this should not stand? I mean, if you want to give the two-state solution, as you keep saying, a chance, they should stop right now this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Said, I would take issue with the premise of your question. We have spoken to this clearly and unequivocally &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I understand that you’ve spoken – sorry to interrupt, but you speak all the time. I said that to begin with. But you – what action are you taking to make sure that what you say is actually listened to and adhered to?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, first of all, it is important what we say. And you have – as you alluded to, you’ve heard me say this, including in recent days. But we have been very clear, we have been very consistent on this: We believe it is absolutely critical for all parties to refrain from steps that exacerbate tensions. This includes violence, incitement to violence; home demolitions; the eviction of families from homes in East Jerusalem, including families that have lived there for generations; that includes the destruction of property and for providing compensation for individuals imprisoned for acts of terrorism. All of these things move us further away from what continues to be our desired end state, and that is a two-state solution – a two-state solution that continues to be in the best interests of Israel, of the Palestinian people, and something that successive American administrations have supported.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Now, one last question on Omar Assad, the Palestinian-American who died in Israeli custody. I know that last Tuesday you guys issued a statement. Has anything transpired since then? Have the Israelis come forward to you? Are you completely satisfied, or are you still asking for more accountability? Because apparently, those who did it, they were sort of slapped on the wrist.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, we did issue a statement on this yesterday. That statement spoke of our concern, but it also spoke of our ongoing dialogue with our Israeli partners on this.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>You did?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We did. We issued one on February 1st, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah, not yesterday. Yesterday &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sorry, did I say yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yes, you did.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We issued it last week. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Last Tuesday. Last week we got it.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes, yes. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Just a quick update on Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Do you have any idea when you’re going to have the formal response from Moscow and when there is new engagement with Foreign Minister Lavrov &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We don’t <a id="post-312152-RUSSIAUKRAINE"></a>have any updates on that. As I conveyed last week, the Secretary had an opportunity to speak to Foreign Minister Lavrov. It was our understanding following that engagement that the Russians were working on a response to our so-called non-paper, a response that would be sent to and approved, presumably, by Vladimir Putin before it would transmitted back to us. That has not yet happened. It was also our understanding that once that did happen, that the Russians would be prepared to engage in follow-on diplomacy, but again, we’ll need to – the first step in that was receiving the Russian response, which has not yet happened.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And do you expect that follow-on engagement can happen while the Secretary is traveling, or more probably when he comes back from his travel?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We don’t have any additional details to share in terms of timing, in terms of format or the mode for that engagement, so I’d hesitate to get ahead of it.</p>
<p>Ben.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just make sure – I think I know the answer to this, but I just want to make about the – and without getting into the whole back and forth that happened last week, your &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t know what you’re talking about, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, and nor do I. Your belief that there is some Russian false flag operation that’s being planned has not changed, right, since last Thursday? Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That is correct. That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And are you prepared today to offer any additional &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What I am prepared to do today is to explain what I perhaps inartfully tried to do last week in explaining what it is we’re trying to do and why we’re not able to provide a full set of information or at least all of the information that you and your colleagues may ask for. The Secretary spoke to this briefly earlier today, but this gets to our bottom line proposition. We believe that the best antidote to disinformation is information, and that is why you have seen us employ concerted efforts across the board. We want to go the extra mile to ensure that, again, to the extent possible, the American people and people around the world have an understanding of what we know and what undergirds our concern for the threat that Moscow poses.</p>
<p>Now, an element of that has been our declassification of information, including intelligence information, that is in our possession. And as you heard me say last week, we’ve done that with two overriding objectives in mind. The first and, of course, our preference is to be in a position to deter the Russians from going forward. We want by exposing this information and making sure that Moscow knows what we know to have them think twice or many more times before moving forward with such a reckless action.</p>
<p>If we’re not able to do that, if we’re not able to deter further invasion or aggression against Ukraine, we at least want to be in the position of having let the world know that despite the disinformation, despite the propaganda and lies that presumably Moscow will say after the fact, that the world will know what we knew all along, and that is the fact that Moscow sought to fabricate a pretext for this aggression very similar to what they did in 2014. Matt, you know that in 2014 the Russians went into Ukraine, sent their proxy forces into Ukraine, claiming that Russians were under threat, claiming that a three-year-old boy had been crucified, claiming that they had no choice but to do so. Again, this is why we are so concerned about what we are seeing now and what we know now.</p>
<p>Now, in taking this approach, we recognize that the information that we’re able to put forward will necessarily be limited, and it will be limited for a reason that you also know well. Again, we – even as we seek to expose Moscow’s efforts, we don’t want to jeopardize or potentially jeopardize our ability to collect this kind of information going forward. But when we do the cost-benefit analysis and we consider if the choice is between putting forward necessarily incomplete, sometimes broad, sometimes general information in an attempt to deter aggression or, on the other hand, if the choice is to keep that to ourselves and potentially not play every card available to us, that’s not a difficult choice.</p>
<p>Again, we are doing this in an effort to, in the first instance, deter; if we’re not able to do that, to expose what Moscow has had in mind all along. We want to see this crisis resolved peacefully, we want to see this crisis resolved diplomatically, and we will do everything we responsibly think we can – responsible in terms of tactics, but also responsible in terms of our national security and our ability to continue to benefit from this information going forward to bring about what we hope is a diplomatic outcome.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. So – and I’m not going to get into sort of what like we – I did last week, but the bottom line is that no, you are not prepared to share any of the information that you have that would suggest that this is actually correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Again, we have shared significant information &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No, no &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Ned, I said I didn’t want to get back into this. Do you have anything more that you can say &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Beyond &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>&#8212; to back up the claim than you did – than you had to say last week? That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Beyond what we told you last week &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>&#8212; in pretty detailed terms about the Russian plans &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We don’t have anything further to offer on that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. And then and the proof &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Then you’re saying – hold on, Said, just – last one. The proof that you’re correct is that nothing is actually going to happen? Is that what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, I – that is not – that’s not &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Because you will have – because you putting this out there will have stopped the Russians from doing it, correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, I – what I said is that our overriding objective in the first instance is to deter Russian aggression. That is why we are doing a number of things.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I’m speaking entirely only about this alleged false flag operation that you’re talking about. You’re saying that the proof that there is a false flag operation is going to come when nothing actually happens, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I did not say that, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I said that our overriding objective is to deter Russian aggression against Ukraine, further Russian aggression against Ukraine. I acknowledge I will probably never be able – well, I will certainly never be able to give you the proof that you I’m sure want. But we are doing this – we are doing this not in an effort, I’m sorry to say, to satisfy you but in an effort to prevent and deter an invasion.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>It’s not really about satisfying me. But anyway, I don’t want to – I don’t want to take up &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Ned, can you clarify something at this time?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So you think that the Russians are still scheming to do this today with the same intensity as they were last week? Or have they &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I’m not in a position to give you an update on this specific scheme, but I think our concerns about the Russians potentially resorting to these tactics, the same sort of false flag tactics that they have – that they did resort to in the past, those concerns are still very present.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay, you know one gets the impression that an attack or an invasion is imminent, it’s just a question of time, maybe a few days, mid-month, whatever. So on the scale of one to ten – I know you guys like this – what is the likelihood of invasion? Is it about seven? Is it about eight? Are we today closer to nine, let’s say, than we were last week?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I am going to refer you to Vladimir Putin. Again, we have put forward these two paths. It is our strong, strong preference that we pursue the path of diplomacy and dialogue. What I will say and what you heard the National Security Advisor speak to yesterday is that we are now in the window, given what we have seen from the Russians over weeks and even longer now – amassing troops along Ukraine’s borders, dispatching forces into Belarus, taking other steps that have positioned them to move forward at any moment if they so choose.</p>
<p>We do not yet believe that Vladimir Putin has made a decision. It is our goal in all of this, including what I was discussing with Matt just a moment ago, to deter an invasion. If we’re not able to deter an invasion, we will then resort to the other path. It’s a path of hefty, stark consequences for Russia. It’s also a path of defense for our allies on the eastern flank of NATO.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Are you aware of reports where a high-level Russian officer – or the head of the officers school, whatever it is – warned Putin against the invasion of Ukraine?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I’ve seen these reports. I understand that there was an open letter, so I’ve certainly seek that – seen that. Again, I don’t have a specific comment on it. Our goal is to solve conflicts through diplomacy. We’re seeking to do that for the good of the American people, the good of Ukrainian people, the good of the Russian people, and people all throughout Europe, knowing that any renewed invasion of Ukraine would carry tremendous costs, tremendous costs across many realms. It’s our goal to do everything we can to avoid that.</p>
<p>Yes, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>You just said in your answer to Matt that if you have to put forward incomplete information to deter an attack, then so be it. What were you referring to there? I mean, is the intelligence behind this video perhaps incomplete?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, I was referring to the fact that there have been demands for everything we have in our possession behind this intelligence, and that’s not something we’re able to provide, again, because of our desire not to jeopardize sources and methods, our desire not to jeopardize &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, if you’re referring to me, that’s not true. I asked for literally, quote/unquote, any shred of evidence – not even proof, because not all evidence is proof. I asked for anything. I didn’t ask for everything. I didn’t ask for sources or methods. I just asked &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I think &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>&#8212; for anything that would back it up. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>The challenge, Matt, is that by divulging details, further details, you would necessarily get into sources and methods. And so that is why we’re in the position of putting forward what we know in a way that we consider to be responsible vis-à-vis our objectives going forward, and one of those objectives going forward is to protect our ability to collect this kind of information going forward. We are trying to strike a very difficult balance. There are – when it comes to national security and the tension, the inherent tension between national security and transparency, there is never an easy formula. Not always do we get it right. No administration has always gotten it right, but we are leaning forward here.</p>
<p>The only reason we’re having this discussion is because we publicized some of what was in our possession. We could have kept that to ourselves. It would have made for a much less memorable briefing last Thursday, but that wasn’t the responsible thing in our estimation to do. Again, we want to make sure at the end of the day, whether we are able to deter an invasion or whether in the aftermath of an invasion, that we have done everything we responsibly can to do that. And one of the tactics we’ve used, one of the tactics I would say we’ve used probably more so than previous administrations, is declassifying information or making public information that previously was not public. That is not something that – it is not something that administrations have done certainly to this degree.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>You also say that we’re in the window now where an attack might happen. You’ve said it repeatedly that an attack is imminent.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We’ve never said repeatedly that an attack is imminent. We have said that we are now in the window where if &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I think numerous times you’ve used the word “imminent.”</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We – we have said that if Vladimir Putin decides to move &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Inaudible) and 50,000 people are going to be dead. What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I can’t be accountable for what others write. What we have said &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>What others write?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>What &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And “imminent” is a word that has been used.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>What we have said is that if Vladimir Putin decides to go forward with an invasion, they have now positioned themselves to the degree that they’re able to do that whether it is within a day, within a couple weeks. They have now reached that point.</p>
<p>But imminent suggests that this is a foregone conclusion, that this is a certainty. So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No one in the administration has used the word “imminent” to describe &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I think what you might have heard is potentially imminent. That &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>What – if an invasion were imminent, we would not be prioritizing diplomacy and dialogue the way we have. Imminence suggests that this is a foregone conclusion, that there is no way to avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I think if you’ve been listening to what we’ve been saying for the past two months now, the emphasis we’ve placed on dialogue and diplomacy, the emphasis that we’ve placed on deterring an invasion, the emphasis that we have placed on finding a diplomatic way out of this, you would understand that we’re not talking about something that is a foregone conclusion. We are talking about something that is one of two paths. We’ve consistently talked about one of two paths. It’s certainly possible that Vladimir Putin will choose that path. It is our hope that he will choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue, that we can avoid the bloodshed, that we can avoid the violence, that we can avoid the destabilizing forces that would descend not only on Ukraine but well beyond in terms of the implications.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>My question was actually going to be: Considering that we are in that window now and there’s talk of a potentially imminent invasion, was there ever a discussion about postponing the Australia trip? Is now the right time to be crossing the world, going to Fiji, when this invasion could happen at any time?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Ben, we are a big country. We are a big department. We have a lot of challenges on our plate. The Secretary of State is the Secretary of State wherever in the world he is. He has access to secure communications wherever in the world he is. He, I’m sure, will be focused to a large degree on this challenge even while he is in the Indo-Pacific. It will certainly come up in conversations with counterparts in the Quad and elsewhere, but I can assure you, you will also see that he will remain active on the phones with our interagency counterparts. He and we are capable of – again, not to use an overused metaphor, but of walking and chewing gum at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Sorry, Ned, but the Secretary said &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And juggling.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>And juggling.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>The Secretary said that Ukraine is prepared to give special status in the Donbas region.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>He was referring to the – he was referring to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Is that, like, sort of walking back from the – that sort of thing?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, it was – it is reiterating what’s in the Minsk Agreements. The Minsk Agreements spell out a means by which to de-escalate the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. Special status is a term that’s used in the Minsk Agreements.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Ben.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>After you made the accusation last week – the administration – about this false flag operation and then the reassessments leaked over the weekend, the Ukrainian foreign minister tweeted today, “Do not believe the apocalyptic predictions. Different capitals are calculating different scenarios.” Is he wrong that there isn’t this sort of apocalyptic situation that you all are discussing?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We see eye to eye with our Ukrainian partners in the sense that now is not the time for panic. What we are calling for, what we are doing is moving forward with preparation. We want to be prepared and we need to position ourselves to be prepared regardless of which path it is that Vladimir Putin takes. It’s our hope that we pursue that of dialogue and diplomacy. It is certainly possible that we are not able to deter an invasion and not able to deter renewed aggression and that we’ll have to be prepared for that path of defense and deterrence.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But, I mean, you say that you’re seeing eye to eye. He’s saying that what you’re saying is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t think you’ve heard us use the term “cataclysmic,” if that’s – if that was the quote.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> “Apocalyptic.”</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> “Apocalyptic.”</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But he was specifically referring to what U.S. officials have said in recent days, in the last week.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I – the Ukrainian ambassador to Washington has spoken to this; President Zelenskyy has spoken to our coordination with the Ukrainian Government. What we are doing is engaged in prudent preparation. We are doing that with our European allies but also with our Ukrainian partners.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> When the Secretary and Foreign Minister Kuleba spoke on Friday, did the foreign minister express any of these concerns to the Secretary?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Again, we issued a readout of that call, so I don’t have anything to add beyond that readout. We have a close relationship with Ukraine. Ukraine, of course, is a close partner of ours. We can speak candidly with close partners when it comes to our concerns. Our Ukrainian partners, our European allies, and others, they know of the basis for our concerns. Number one, they hear what we say publicly in the same way you do, but we are also in a position to share some of that underlying information with our European allies, with other allies, as well as with our Ukrainian partners.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one last question on this. During – in the Ukrainian readout as well, it said that the Secretary reaffirmed the U.S. was working to provide additional economic assistance to the Ukrainian Government. Can you say anything more about that? What’s on the table, dollar amount, or if anything is forthcoming?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, so we have said for some time now that even as we work to provide Ukraine with security assistance, we know that this – certainly Russian aggression, even the threat of Russian aggression, could have a toll on Ukraine’s economy. So we have provided half a billion dollars in development and humanitarian assistance in the past year. We are exploring additional macroeconomic support to help Ukraine’s economy amidst pressure resulting from Russia’s military buildup.</p>
<p>Last week, on February 3rd, we and several of our allies and partners announced a new partnership fund for a resilient Ukraine. It’s a fund that bolsters the resilience and perseverance of communities in eastern Ukraine, those communities that are in some ways bearing the brunt, have borne the brunt of Russia’s aggression. USAID has a expert in the country who’s monitoring the situation closely, coordinating with other donors, assessing the evolving humanitarian needs of the Ukrainian people, and liaising with partners to ensure that they are able to rapidly scale up assistance should the need arise.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we and Ukraine have finalized a memorandum of understanding on commercial cooperation. It’s a memorandum, MOU, designed to facilitate commercial participation by U.S. companies across the Ukrainian economy and by Ukrainian companies here in the United States.</p>
<p>And then finally, the EXIM, the Export-Import Bank, has made available $3 billion in support for projects in Ukraine, and the DFC, the Development Finance Corporation, has a current investment portfolio in Ukraine of approximately $800 million across more than a dozen projects. Those range from renewable energy to higher education and access to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>Rosiland.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Stay on Ukraine?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m going to take off my mask because I can’t hear when I wear this. You keep talking about we want to resolve this diplomatically. There are reports that the Ukrainians have asked the U.S. to station some THAAD anti-missile systems in the eastern part of the country, ostensibly to guard against any Russian missile attacks. The UK has decided to deploy 350 Royal Marines to Poland. Are these kinds of actions the thing that the West wants to be telegraphing if it wants Moscow to actually resolve all of these issues about Ukraine and about NATO’s posture? I mean, how does that – how does moving troops and possibly stationing anti-missile systems actually get you what you want?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure. So I can’t speak to moves that haven’t been announced, that are hypothetical, that may not come to pass. But what I can speak to is what we’ve announced, and everything we have announced has been in the vein of defense and deterrence, across the board. Whether it is our security assistance for Ukraine – the $650 million that was provided last year – that is defensive security assistance; whether it is the authorization for our NATO Allies to pass U.S.-origin material to Ukraine, that is defensive material.</p>
<p>When it comes to the service members who have been put on heightened state of readiness should they be called upon by the North Atlantic Council, that would be in the vein of defense and deterrence. When it comes to the service members who are being sent to offer reassurance and sent to deter further Russian aggression against – or Russian aggression, I should say – against NATO’s eastern flank, that is done in the vein of defense and deterrence.</p>
<p>Everything we are doing is in an effort to see to it that we are not faced with a renewed Russian invasion, that Russian aggression does not move forward. Now, we are doing all of this also knowing that in the end, Vladimir Putin may choose the path of conflict, of an invasion, of renewed aggression. But we are doing, as I was saying to Matt and to others earlier, everything we can in an effort to in the first instance deter, but also to send a very clear signal that we stand by our commitments under Article 5 when it comes to protecting our NATO Allies, that the United States will live up to its obligations, the United States will continue to provide the sort of defensive security assistance that Ukraine needs to defend itself.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But deploying a THAAD system is a pretty serious deal. I mean, think about the controversy in Korea, where they have asked for the systems and it’s engendered a lot of uproar as well as criticism from Pyongyang.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Again, I can’t speak to measures that haven’t been announced or that remain hypothetical.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Let me also ask you about Macron’s meeting with Putin today. What sense does the U.S. have about what Macron was going to try to bring up once the cameras left the meeting room? Has Ambassador Sullivan and his team been able to get a readout from the French on how willing Putin is to back away in this crisis?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, when it comes to the engagement of our partners, let me make the broader point that over the past month-plus, we have heard from our European allies, we have heard from our Ukrainian partners, we’ve heard from others an appreciation for what the United States has been doing with Russia diplomatically, and that includes in our bilateral engagement. And in expressing that appreciation and understanding, we’ve heard from our allies and partners that they have taken that approach because we have done all of this in a manner that is thoroughly coordinated, that has been consultative in its approach with our allies and partners, and that is conducted in full transparency with them. “Nothing about without” is not just a mantra for us, it is the guiding principle in terms of how we have conducted ourselves, including in this – in our bilateral engagements with Russia.</p>
<p>So, similarly, we would welcome any diplomatic efforts that are conducted in a similar manner that have the potential – excuse me – to de-escalate the crisis that Moscow has needlessly precipitated. When it comes to the<a id="post-312152-FRANCERUSSIA"></a> French, as you know, President Biden yesterday had an opportunity to speak to President Macron. This would be his second conversation with the French president in several days. Secretary Blinken yesterday spoke to the foreign minister, Foreign Minister Le Drian. We are well coordinated across the board, and that includes with the French, with Paris.</p>
<p>The result of all of this is that the message President Putin is hearing from the United States, from NATO, from our allies and partner – partners, it is loud and it is singular, and that is the fact that a diplomatic solution is the only responsible path. But again, if Russia chooses otherwise, we will be prepared. We will be prepared with a response that is swift, severe, and united. I saw President Macron made comments just before he left. You will hear those same messages from the French president.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And is the U.S. confident that once Chancellor Scholz goes to Moscow next week that that same unified message is going to be delivered? Because Germany is in a slightly different position than other countries in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, as luck would have it, C<a id="post-312152-GERMANYRUSSIA"></a>hancellor Scholz is in Washington today. He’s at the White House today. But I should say this is not luck, the fact that Chancellor Scholz is here to have these consultations with President Biden, a follow-on to the consultations and the discussions that the two leaders have had over the phone and over video conference in recent weeks. This is a testament to the close and continued coordination and cooperation with our European allies across the board – board, excuse me – including, of course, with Germany. So I expect you’ll be hearing a lot more about that today from the President and chancellor.</p>
<p>Yes, in the back.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, I’d like to ask about proximity of Vladimir Putin and Latin America. So last week the Argentinian President Alberto Fernández was in Moscow, and in the coming days the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro will be there. And there are reports in Brazil about the fact that the U.S. is putting pressure on Bolsonaro to cancel his trip to Russia. I would like you to elaborate a bit about the concerns and the reasons why the U.S. wants Brazil to skip this trip to Russia, and if the U.S. has the same confidence that – you talked about France – that you are well coordinated when we are talking about the Brazilian visit to Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we engage with our<a id="post-312152-BRAZILRUSSIA"></a> Brazilian partners on – at multiple levels regularly. We are, of course, aware of the reports of President Bolsonaro’s travel plans. We and many other nations around the world, including in this hemisphere, are deeply concerned about the potentially destabilizing role that Russia is playing and its ongoing threat to sovereignty and to territorial integrity, including, of course, in Ukraine.</p>
<p>As democratic countries – the United States, Brazil, Argentina, others in the region and beyond – we have a responsibility to stand up for democratic principles and for the rules-based order. This is the same order that has undergirded unprecedented levels of stability, of security, of prosperity over the past 70 years, and that is true – it is equally true in Europe as it is in the Western Hemisphere, as it is in the Indo-Pacific. So we know that Brazil and other countries in the region – you mentioned Argentina as well – we share values. That is one of the hallmarks of our relationship, and we have – we know that those values will be conveyed and will undergird concerns that President Putin hears not only from the United States but our partners around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But what does the U.S. expect from this Brazilian visit to Moscow?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It’s not for us to speak to what – the goals that President Bolsonaro may have in mind. I am confident that there will be discussions both before and after the trip with our Brazilian partners.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, and if China pledges it support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as North Korea, what actions will the United States take against China for this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sorry. Could you clarify the question?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. China pledged to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as North Korea. What actions will the United States take against China?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, so if you’re asking about the relationship between <a id="post-312152-CHINARUSSIA"></a>Russia and China, I know that this is something that our Assistant Secretary for Asia and Pacific Affairs Dan Kritenbrink spoke to last week. But what we have seen over the course not of days, not of weeks, but of years and probably longer, is an approach that both of these countries have taken for some time, and that is an increasing closeness between Russia and China.</p>
<p>It would be our hope, given the implications of a renewed Russian aggression and certainly Russian invasion of Ukraine, that the PRC would have taken advantage of dialogue, of this relationship, to encourage Russia to pursue the course of diplomacy and de-escalation. This is what the world expects of responsible powers.</p>
<p>The Secretary had a conversation with Foreign Minister Wang of the PRC the other week – the other day, I should say – and there was a discussion of the potential for renewed Russian aggression, renewed Russian invasion, of Ukraine, and the fact that it would not only have implications in Ukraine, not only in Europe, but in many ways it would be a threat to peace and security around the world because it would be a flagrant violation of the same rules-based international order that applies equally in the Indo-Pacific as it does in Europe.</p>
<p>If in the end China is seen as having supported Russia’s move to choose conflict or war over diplomacy, it will cost China in terms of how it’s seen in the eyes of the world. It will have an effect on the PRC’s global reputation. We – as Russia and China talk about a singular partnership, we are focused with our 29 NATO Allies, we are working with the EU, we are working with our allies in the Indo-Pacific and partners around the world to not only incentivize and to work towards a diplomatic resolution, but also to be in a position to respond decisively if Russia does choose the path of aggression.</p>
<p>We told you last month of – we listed out many of the engagements that we’ve had with partners and allies. That tally has now grown to some 200 phone calls, in-person meetings, video conferences. Of course, one of them you saw today when Secretary Blinken hosted High Representative Josep Borrell of the EU.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>On North Korea, UN sanctions monitors reported to the Security Council that cyber attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions by North Korea were an important revenue source for North Korea to fund its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. What is the United States doing to try and stop this, and does the U.S. believe North Korea’s receiving any outside help to help carry out these cyber attacks?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I don’t have any assessment to offer from here in terms of outside support or assistance that <a id="post-312152-NORTHKOREA2"></a>North Korea may be receiving. What I can say generally without speaking to any specific report at this time is that North Korea’s activity and behavior in cyberspace has long been a serious concern of the United States. We have in the past disclosed and attributed malicious attacks to the DPRK – the attack in 2014, I believe it was, that the DPRK perpetrated against a private American company, a destructive attack against Sony may be an instructive case in point for some of the capabilities and some of the behavior that the DPRK has exhibited in cyberspace.</p>
<p>So it is not just the DPRK’s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. It is – it is not just its record on human rights. There are other profound concerns we have, including its behavior in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Yes, Ben. Welcome to – yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>With the restoration – with the restoration of the sanctions waiver on<a id="post-312152-IRAN"></a> Iran, which is akin to lifting sanctions in the sense that it enriches them to a certain degree &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, it does not, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>But wasn’t that &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>But it – that’s not true. It does not do that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, was the restoration of the sanctions waiver in any way an incentive to get them back to the table and continue negotiations?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So to be very clear, what you said was not true. The issuance of the so-called IFCA waiver in no way enriches Iran. This is about two things. This is about nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear safety. I would suspect most reasonable observers would agree that both of these things are in our vital national interest regardless of what happens with the JCPOA, if we’re able to achieve a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA or if we’re not. We decided to renew and to restore this sanctions waiver to do one thing, and that is to enable third-party participation in nuclear non-proliferation and safety projects in Iran, owing to the growing proliferation concerns we have, in particular with respect to the increasing stockpiles of enriched uranium in Iran, the stockpiles that have grown following the last administration’s decision to abandon the JCPOA.</p>
<p>Absent this waiver, the sort of detailed technical discussions with third parties regarding the disposition of stockpiles and other activities of non-proliferation value, they couldn’t take place. The Trump administration, as you know, provided a similar waiver for years even after its foolish decision to leave the JCPOA, precisely because the last administration recognized the non-proliferation value of these waivers. I don’t know that I’ve quoted Secretary Pompeo before from here, but Secretary Pompeo said about this waiver, quote, “This decision will help…reduce proliferation risks.”</p>
<p>So additionally, the technical discussions facilitated by the waiver are necessary in the final weeks of JCPOA talks, as the waiver itself would be essential if we were be in a position – to be in a position to – if Iran were to resume compliance with its nuclear commitments. But again, even if talks do not culminate in a mutual return to compliance, these sorts of technical discussions could still contribute to our non-proliferation goals.</p>
<p>Non-proliferation, nuclear safety – these things may not mean a lot to a whole lot of people. So just to give you a few examples of activities that these waivers – this waiver would cover: for example, the modernization of the Arak reactor based on the design approved by the JCPOA, the conversion of the reactor to a much less proliferation-sensitive design. This waiver would approve the preparation and modification of the Fordow facility for stable isotope production. It would remove a potential impediment to efforts to end uranium enrichment at Fordow, as Iran committed to do under the JCPOA. It would facilitate the transfer outside Iran of enriched uranium to result in a reduction in Iran’s stockpile to no more than 300 kilograms of up to 3.67 percent enriched LEU.</p>
<p>I could go on, but the point is that this waiver is not about providing Iran with funds. This waiver is about what is manifestly in our nonproliferation interests, in our – in service of nonproliferation safety to the United States, to our partners and allies around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can you talk about the timing of it, though, and why the decision was taken on Friday?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did it have anything to do with &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, the fact is if we are in a position to resume compliance with the JCPOA, this waiver will need to be in place in order to effect some of the steps to make Iran’s nuclear program less dangerous. If we are not in a position to achieve a mutual return to compliance, these are still – these steps are still in our interest.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What makes you think that that next step that they are – that we’re one step closer to rejoining the JCPOA then?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I didn’t say that we were. I’m saying that this prepares us in the event we are able to achieve a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA. This could still very much go one of two ways: a mutual return to compliance if Iran is in a position and willing and able to make the sort of political commitments necessary; or the alternatives that we’ve talked about in some less deal – detail but that we still talked about.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, are you – that long list of things that you said that these waivers give, you’re saying that there’s no benefit to Iran in any of that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I am saying that the net benefit of this is a nonproliferation benefit for us.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Iran gets nothing out of it?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> When you say sanctions waiver &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m not talking about – hold on a second.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, you don’t need to raise your voice. You don’t &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But you’re the one – you’re the one who – you guys are the ones who said you were restoring the waivers, right? Okay. So if Iran really gets no benefit at all out of this, then why even bother?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Why bother? I just explained to Ben. Because if &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, well, you – tell me why Iran doesn’t benefit from this.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, this is something that redounds &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You’re talking about – you’re assuming that everyone thinks that sanctions relief equals dollars &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, that was the question.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; going to Iran.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The question was you just waived &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It was.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> That wasn’t really the question.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It was.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> That was the way you interpreted the question.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> You can refer to the transcript.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So sanctions relief does not necessarily mean only dollar bills flying across the table into Iran – into the Iranian treasury’s coffers, does it? Or is &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> In this case, it will allow Iran to undertake nuclear nonproliferation and safety activities that would otherwise be proscribed.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, which is a benefit to Iran that it was not getting before.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The fact is, Matt, that what is in our nonproliferation interest can also be, in some ways, in Iran’s interest. That doesn’t change the fact that it is manifestly in our interest.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do they – so do they get a benefit of &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, I was referring to the sort &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do they get any benefit out of this or not?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It is – some of these steps redound to their interest.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do they get any benefit or not?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> This is in our interest to do, which is precisely why the last &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is it in Iran’s interest as well?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; which is why the last administration did it. In 2018, Secretary Pompeo, as I quoted before, said precisely this decision will help reduce proliferation &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And two years later – and two years later when he rescinded the waivers, he said that – he accused of Iran of taking – of participating in nuclear blackmail and said that they weren’t – that they weren’t deserving of the benefits that accrue to them under this.</p>
<p>You’re stuck on this idea that – and interesting that you used the word “enrich” because I think you’re talking about it in terms of money, but enrichment obviously has a different kind of meaning when it comes to Iran. But I don’t understand how you can say that Iran gets no benefit and that this isn’t some kind of sanctions relief that you – that the administration has offered to Iran before it has made any of its own concessions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, the question I was responding to took this in a vein &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Well, then, forget about the question you were &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; you think you were responding to. Answer my question: Does Iran benefit at all from the waivers that were signed?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> You will need to ask the Iranian Government whether they think this is a benefit to them. We know &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, who do you think this benefits? Just you?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We know this is of benefit to us. The ability of third-party entities to work on nuclear nonproliferation projects &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, I’m sorry, now is the U.S. &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; and nuclear safety projects in Iran in the face of our growing concerns, nonproliferation and nuclear safety concerns – that is in our benefit, yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The people that this benefits, in fact, are actually Russian, Chinese, European companies, right? Is that what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, I am saying that it is manifestly to our advantage &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And not Iran’s?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It benefits us to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Well, if you can argue that &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; be able to address nuclear safety and nuclear nonproliferation concerns on Iran.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> If you’re able to argue that Iran gets no benefit out of this successfully, which you haven’t convinced me of, but anyway – but if you’re able to, then good on you. Now, do you think that these waivers trigger INARA?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Matt, we have a robust conversation with Congress on progress in Vienna. We have briefed Congress regularly on the discussions. I have every expectations that those briefings will continue in the days and weeks ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, do you believe that this triggers the requirements of the Iran Nuclear Review Act?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>What I can say is that we’ve had conversations with Congress about requirements should we be in a position to resume compliance with the JCPOA, but I don’t have anything for you on these particular – this IFCA waiver.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No, not IFCA. INARA.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Right, but you’re saying “these” in response to IFCA.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah. Well, so you’re aware of the requirements of INARA, right? That any agreement reached with Iran has to be submitted. Are you saying that it did trigger INARA and your notification to Congress on Friday fulfills the requirements of INARA?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, I’m not saying that. I’m saying &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Oh, well, then why did you even notify Congress in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We regularly notify Congress when it comes to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Laughter.) Okay. Well – so did it trigger INARA or not?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Matt, when it – we will carefully consider the facts and circumstances when it comes to any potential U.S. return to the JCPOA to determine the implications under INARA.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So you don’t think that this falls under the scope of INARA.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I have no reason to believe that this was done pursuant to INARA. This is something we, as I said before, we regularly engage with Congress when it comes to developments in Vienna &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, it’s a technical issue. I get that, and probably boring the hell out of everybody, but it is an important one, because if it – even if the notification wasn’t done under INARA, do you think that the waivers trigger the – trigger the INARA requirements for any agreement with Iran related to its nuclear program? These do relate to its nuclear program, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>This is, as you said, a technical question, so we’ll get you a technical answer.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Ned, why shouldn’t Iran benefit – why shouldn’t Iran benefit from the waiver? I mean, I thought the whole purpose of negotiations is so everybody goes back to the deal and sanctions will be lifted, Iran will pull back from any nuclear threat and so on, and everything will be hunky-dory. So why is that such a bad thing if Iran benefits?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>You’ll have to ask &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No, I’m asking you because you – you’re the one who’s &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I am not speaking to what Iran may be saying about this; I am speaking to the benefits that we accrue.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Isn’t that the incentive for Iran to go on in good faith in these negotiations and so on?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, the basic formula of the JCPOA, leaving aside Matt’s questioning about these specific measures, is in fact permanent, verifiable limits on Iran’s nuclear program in return for sanctions relief.</p>
<p>Francesco</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Do you have any indication that the talks resume tomorrow, that the Iranian negotiators are coming back empowered by the political decision you were expecting for &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We will have a better idea of that once the talks resume.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Wendy Sherman will be in Vienna for an OSCE meeting tomorrow. Will she meet with the U.S.-Iran team, any of the P5+1, or even the Iranians while there?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>She’s taking part virtually.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Oh, okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Thank you all very much.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>One more – sorry.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Okay, sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Is – are the <a id="post-312152-RUSSIAUKRAINE2"></a>Russians taking a little bit longer to respond to this – the U.S. proposal than anticipated?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>You’ll have to ask them. I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No sense of any indigestion as they’re processing this &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>You will have to ask them about their gastrointestinal fortitude.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Can you just tell us what the AUKUS call that is on the schedule for this afternoon, I think, is about?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So we’ll have an opportunity – I do expect we’ll have a readout of the call. But in advance of the Secretary’s travel to the Indo-Pacific, this is just another opportunity for him to have a conversation with our<a id="post-312152-AUKUS"></a> AUKUS partners. They will, I suspect, discuss the work currently underway and the progress made in the implementation of some of the initiatives that we have talked about in the context of AUKUS. I don’t want to get ahead of that readout, but I think you will see one late this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>It’s the first follow-up at this level since AUKUS was announced, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>It’s been several months.</p>
<p>Yes, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Do you have any comment on China using a Uyghur to light the Olympic flame and what the State Department thinks?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Not specifically beyond the point that we’ve repeatedly made, that the P<a id="post-312152-CHINA"></a>RC has sought to – the PRC has sought to disguise the true reality of what is going on, what has gone on in Xinjiang – that is the ongoing genocide, those are the crimes against humanity, that’s the human rights abuses that have taken place there. But when it comes to their motives for choosing this specific individual, I’d have to refer you to them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Will Rob Malley be in Vienna tomorrow for the start of the talks?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>He is traveling to <a id="post-312152-IRAN2"></a>Vienna today. Thank you all very much.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:36 p.m. EST</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon. One element at the top, and then we’ll go ahead and get started with your questions.</p>
<p>The United States is deeply concerned by <a id="post-312152-TUNISIA"></a>Tunisian President Saied’s calls to dissolve the Supreme Judicial Council, and the reported barring of employees from entering the Supreme Judicial Council.</p>
<p>An independent judiciary is a core element of an effective and transparent democracy.</p>
<p>It is essential that the Government of Tunisia uphold its commitments to respect the independence of the judiciary as stipulated in the constitution.</p>
<p>The United States reiterates our calls for an accelerated political reform process in Tunisia that responds to the aspirations of the Tunisian people through the inclusion of diverse voices representing political parties, civil society and unions, particularly in the ongoing national consultations, and that ensures the continued respect for Tunisia’s human rights.</p>
<p>At this critical time, we also urge the Government of Tunisia to prioritize implementing the economic reforms required to stabilize the financial situation and address Tunisia’s growing economic challenges.</p>
<p>With that, happy to take your questions. Matt.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks, Ned. So I realize that <a id="post-312152-UKRAINERUSSIAREGION"></a>Ukraine is still the flavor of the day, but I don’t really have anything big on Ukraine, so I will – after I ask my first very brief initial question I’ll defer to others on Ukraine because I want to go to Iran.</p>
<p>Just on Ukraine, the joint statement – I realize that in the press conference the Secretary and Mr. Borrell spoke about Russia, but I’m just wondering why there was no mention of Russia at all in the joint statement from the EU-U.S. Energy Council meeting. I mean, it wasn’t – the word wasn’t even in there.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, the word Ukraine certainly was. There was a &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, it was.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> There was a robust discussion of Ukraine. There was a robust discussion of the contingency planning that we’re doing in the event that Russia does not choose the path of diplomacy, does not choose the path of dialogue. And as the joint statement noted, the council reiterated that it is unacceptable to use energy supplies as a weapon or geopolitical lever. This is what we have been saying all along, and much of the discussion today between the Secretary and between the high representative was part and parcel of the contingency planning that we’ve been doing for some time now.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. But what – I mean, was there a reason that Russia is not mentioned in there? I mean presumably, yes, it’s obvious that the threat to European energy security is coming from Russia. They are the main supplier and this is – but I’m just wondering why it wasn’t mentioned. Was there some objection to it being mentioned, or was it – did it ever come up in the discussions?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I am not aware there was any substantive reason for it. It’s a question of syntax.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> All right. Then I will pass and &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But I do want to – I have a couple important ones on Iran.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’m sure we’ll get there. Daphne.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Senior U.S. officials are in Europe this week coordinating sanctions and export control measures that can be used in the event that Russia invades Ukraine. Is the U.S. looking for commitments from counterparts during this trip on what action will be taken if Russia invades, and will Nord Stream 2 be part of discussions?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So, Daphne, what we spoke about earlier was the fact that we continue to take part in robust and to lead robust coordination and consultation with our European partners and allies on the consequences that would befall Moscow if it chooses the path of aggression. We have been consulting very closely with our allies and our partners over the course not of weeks but really of months now, and that includes the package that would respond to Russian aggression.</p>
<p>And so as you alluded to, today a U.S. delegation that included officials from Treasury and from the Department of State, including the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes Elizabeth Rosenberg, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration Assistant Secretary Rozman Kendler, Deputy Assistant Secretary here at the State Department Molly Montgomery, traveling to Europe to discuss technical coordination. And so over the past several weeks and even longer, we have discussed at a strategic level what we would – what the consequences that would befall Moscow were it choose – were it to choose this path.</p>
<p>There have been very detailed discussions in the context of that. Beyond the broad top lines there are a myriad of details and technical matters that will need to be worked out if we are in the unfortunate position of having to move forward with this strong and unified response. And so what you – what our team from the State Department, from the Department of Commerce, from the Department of Treasury are doing is meeting with their counterparts and European interlocutors to have those – to continue, I should say, those technical discussions to ensure that across the board we’re ready to go should, again, we be in the unfortunate position of needing to mobilize this response.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And will <a id="post-312152-NORDSTREAM"></a>Nord Stream 2 be a part of that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I don’t know if it’ll be part of these specific discussions. What I can say is that, of course, the President is meeting with Chancellor Scholz today at the White House. Leading up to this meeting we have had a number of discussions with our German allies on energy security broadly, on Nord Stream 2 specifically, both in the context of what we’re seeing from Russia and beyond.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Ned. Good to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. I have a few questions on South Korea, China, and North Korea. First of all, on South Korea: South Korea Government frequently fails to participate in the UN Security Council statement condemning North Korea’s missile provocations or ignored North Korea’s human rights issues. How does the U.S. evaluate South Korea’s attitude?</p>
<p>The second one, on China. After the UN Security Council meeting last week, the Chinese ambassador to the UN has blamed United States for the recent missile launch by North Korea. As you know, the South Korea – and I’m sorry, he has insisted that the U.S. should take more flexible approach, as in you know South – North Korea and China and Russia are strategically the same body. What is the United States position on China justifying North Korea’s missile provocations?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> <a id="post-312152-SOUTHKOREANORTHKOREA"></a>So let me take your first question first. As you know, since the start of this administration we have been investing heavily in our alliances and partnerships around the globe, and of course, that includes in the Indo-Pacific. There are a number of shared challenges and shared opportunities we have with our allies in the Indo-Pacific, of course, our treaty allies Japan and the ROK among them. And among those challenges are the DPRK, maybe one of the more – certainly is one of the more pressing challenges we have with those allies.</p>
<p>In recent days, the deputy secretary, the – our Special Representative for the DPRK Sung Kim, they have engaged their South Korean, their ROK, and Japanese counterparts. And as I think you know, this evening we’ll be departing for Australia, where we will see our Japanese counterparts in the context of the Quad – there will be a bilateral engagement there – before we then go by way of Fiji to Hawaii, where we’ll engage in a trilateral discussion with our South Korean and Japanese counterparts. And I think you – I can be confident that one of the priority issues of discussion in that setting will be the recent provocations we’ve seen from the DPRK, including its missile launches.</p>
<p>We know that when it comes to the fulfillment and the achievement of any progress towards our overriding goal, one of the indispensable ingredients is close coordination with our allies and partners. And the Japan – Japan and ROK are, of course, two of our allies with whom we work with most closely on this challenge. We know that that bilateral coordination is important, but we also know that trilateral coordination between the United States, Japan, and the ROK really is and will be indispensable if we are to achieve progress. It’s also a priority for our allies, Japan and the ROK, because of the threat that the DPRK poses not only to Americans in the region, potentially to deployed forces, but also to our treaty allies Japan and the ROK. So it’s something we take extraordinarily seriously and we know they do as well.</p>
<p>When it comes to – and this gets to your second question – our approach to the <a id="post-312152-NORTHKOREA"></a><a id="post-312152-PALESTINIANS"></a>DPRK, look, if you want to assign responsibility for the DPRK’s provocations, for the potential threats to international peace and security we’ve seen emanate from the DPRK, the only party that deserves blame, the only party that can be assigned culpability, is the DPRK. We have made very clear that we have no hostile intent towards the DPRK. We have made very clear that we wish to engage in dialogue and diplomacy. We have made very clear that we believe that only through dialogue and diplomacy can we most effectively achieve what, again, is our overriding policy objective, and that’s the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Follow-up, quick questions. North Korea has been engaged in peace process dialogue with the United States and South Korea in the past, while on the other hand it has been accelerating its – has been North Korea military buildup work. What is the ultimate tool for the United States besides diplomatic compromise to block North Korea global threat?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, the ultimate tool is diplomacy, and we know that previous administrations have tried this. No administration has been successful, despite undertaking strategies that, in many cases, look very different from one another. And so the strategy we have is not akin to the strategy that the last administration had. It is not also exactly akin to the strategy that the Obama administration had. It is a strategy that the Biden-Harris administration has put forward after an intense policy review, and a policy review that determined that, through diplomacy and dialogue, it is our hope that there can be incremental progress – incremental progress towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>Now, of course, we have not yet found a willing partner in Pyongyang to engage in that dialogue, but we have continued even in the absence of substantive engagement from the DPRK to coordinate closely with Japan, with the ROK, other allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, but also allies and partners around the world, which you have seen us do in the UN, which you’ve seen us do in Europe, and elsewhere as we take on this challenge.</p>
<p>Said.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you. Can I go to the Palestinian issue?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I have a couple questions on settler violence on Omar Assad. <a id="post-312152-ISRAELPAL"></a> But before that, the White House issued a statement saying that President Biden is going to go and visit Israel later this year. Is he likely to also go – I mean, I know this is a White House probably question, but do you think that he will also make a detour to, like, Bethlehem or Ramallah 20 minutes away?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, Said, as you alluded to, the readout of the conversation between President Biden and Prime Minister Bennett did make a reference to President Biden’s intent to travel to the region later this year. Obviously, this was just announced yesterday, so I wouldn’t want to get into the itinerary at this point. In any case, I’d need to refer you to the White House.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I understand. Ned, I mean, you – almost every week, you come – you state opposition or displeasure with settler violence activities and so on. And I mean, in the last four days, I could cite a number of issues. I don’t want to go through them all – I mean, the Israelis – from home demolishing to attacks on the Al-Aqsa Mosque to poisoning of wells. I mean, all kinds of things, a whole – across the gamut. When will you guys issue a very strong statement and say this should not stand? I mean, if you want to give the two-state solution, as you keep saying, a chance, they should stop right now this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Said, I would take issue with the premise of your question. We have spoken to this clearly and unequivocally &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I understand that you’ve spoken – sorry to interrupt, but you speak all the time. I said that to begin with. But you – what action are you taking to make sure that what you say is actually listened to and adhered to?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, first of all, it is important what we say. And you have – as you alluded to, you’ve heard me say this, including in recent days. But we have been very clear, we have been very consistent on this: We believe it is absolutely critical for all parties to refrain from steps that exacerbate tensions. This includes violence, incitement to violence; home demolitions; the eviction of families from homes in East Jerusalem, including families that have lived there for generations; that includes the destruction of property and for providing compensation for individuals imprisoned for acts of terrorism. All of these things move us further away from what continues to be our desired end state, and that is a two-state solution – a two-state solution that continues to be in the best interests of Israel, of the Palestinian people, and something that successive American administrations have supported.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Now, one last question on Omar Assad, the Palestinian-American who died in Israeli custody. I know that last Tuesday you guys issued a statement. Has anything transpired since then? Have the Israelis come forward to you? Are you completely satisfied, or are you still asking for more accountability? Because apparently, those who did it, they were sort of slapped on the wrist.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, we did issue a statement on this yesterday. That statement spoke of our concern, but it also spoke of our ongoing dialogue with our Israeli partners on this.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>You did?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We did. We issued one on February 1st, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah, not yesterday. Yesterday &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sorry, did I say yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yes, you did.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We issued it last week. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Last Tuesday. Last week we got it.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes, yes. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Just a quick update on Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Do you have any idea when you’re going to have the formal response from Moscow and when there is new engagement with Foreign Minister Lavrov &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We don’t <a id="post-312152-RUSSIAUKRAINE"></a>have any updates on that. As I conveyed last week, the Secretary had an opportunity to speak to Foreign Minister Lavrov. It was our understanding following that engagement that the Russians were working on a response to our so-called non-paper, a response that would be sent to and approved, presumably, by Vladimir Putin before it would transmitted back to us. That has not yet happened. It was also our understanding that once that did happen, that the Russians would be prepared to engage in follow-on diplomacy, but again, we’ll need to – the first step in that was receiving the Russian response, which has not yet happened.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And do you expect that follow-on engagement can happen while the Secretary is traveling, or more probably when he comes back from his travel?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We don’t have any additional details to share in terms of timing, in terms of format or the mode for that engagement, so I’d hesitate to get ahead of it.</p>
<p>Ben.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just make sure – I think I know the answer to this, but I just want to make about the – and without getting into the whole back and forth that happened last week, your &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t know what you’re talking about, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, and nor do I. Your belief that there is some Russian false flag operation that’s being planned has not changed, right, since last Thursday? Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That is correct. That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And are you prepared today to offer any additional &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What I am prepared to do today is to explain what I perhaps inartfully tried to do last week in explaining what it is we’re trying to do and why we’re not able to provide a full set of information or at least all of the information that you and your colleagues may ask for. The Secretary spoke to this briefly earlier today, but this gets to our bottom line proposition. We believe that the best antidote to disinformation is information, and that is why you have seen us employ concerted efforts across the board. We want to go the extra mile to ensure that, again, to the extent possible, the American people and people around the world have an understanding of what we know and what undergirds our concern for the threat that Moscow poses.</p>
<p>Now, an element of that has been our declassification of information, including intelligence information, that is in our possession. And as you heard me say last week, we’ve done that with two overriding objectives in mind. The first and, of course, our preference is to be in a position to deter the Russians from going forward. We want by exposing this information and making sure that Moscow knows what we know to have them think twice or many more times before moving forward with such a reckless action.</p>
<p>If we’re not able to do that, if we’re not able to deter further invasion or aggression against Ukraine, we at least want to be in the position of having let the world know that despite the disinformation, despite the propaganda and lies that presumably Moscow will say after the fact, that the world will know what we knew all along, and that is the fact that Moscow sought to fabricate a pretext for this aggression very similar to what they did in 2014. Matt, you know that in 2014 the Russians went into Ukraine, sent their proxy forces into Ukraine, claiming that Russians were under threat, claiming that a three-year-old boy had been crucified, claiming that they had no choice but to do so. Again, this is why we are so concerned about what we are seeing now and what we know now.</p>
<p>Now, in taking this approach, we recognize that the information that we’re able to put forward will necessarily be limited, and it will be limited for a reason that you also know well. Again, we – even as we seek to expose Moscow’s efforts, we don’t want to jeopardize or potentially jeopardize our ability to collect this kind of information going forward. But when we do the cost-benefit analysis and we consider if the choice is between putting forward necessarily incomplete, sometimes broad, sometimes general information in an attempt to deter aggression or, on the other hand, if the choice is to keep that to ourselves and potentially not play every card available to us, that’s not a difficult choice.</p>
<p>Again, we are doing this in an effort to, in the first instance, deter; if we’re not able to do that, to expose what Moscow has had in mind all along. We want to see this crisis resolved peacefully, we want to see this crisis resolved diplomatically, and we will do everything we responsibly think we can – responsible in terms of tactics, but also responsible in terms of our national security and our ability to continue to benefit from this information going forward to bring about what we hope is a diplomatic outcome.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. So – and I’m not going to get into sort of what like we – I did last week, but the bottom line is that no, you are not prepared to share any of the information that you have that would suggest that this is actually correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Again, we have shared significant information &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No, no &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Ned, I said I didn’t want to get back into this. Do you have anything more that you can say &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Beyond &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>&#8212; to back up the claim than you did – than you had to say last week? That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Beyond what we told you last week &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>&#8212; in pretty detailed terms about the Russian plans &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We don’t have anything further to offer on that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. And then and the proof &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Then you’re saying – hold on, Said, just – last one. The proof that you’re correct is that nothing is actually going to happen? Is that what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, I – that is not – that’s not &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Because you will have – because you putting this out there will have stopped the Russians from doing it, correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, I – what I said is that our overriding objective in the first instance is to deter Russian aggression. That is why we are doing a number of things.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I’m speaking entirely only about this alleged false flag operation that you’re talking about. You’re saying that the proof that there is a false flag operation is going to come when nothing actually happens, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I did not say that, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I said that our overriding objective is to deter Russian aggression against Ukraine, further Russian aggression against Ukraine. I acknowledge I will probably never be able – well, I will certainly never be able to give you the proof that you I’m sure want. But we are doing this – we are doing this not in an effort, I’m sorry to say, to satisfy you but in an effort to prevent and deter an invasion.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>It’s not really about satisfying me. But anyway, I don’t want to – I don’t want to take up &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Ned, can you clarify something at this time?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So you think that the Russians are still scheming to do this today with the same intensity as they were last week? Or have they &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I’m not in a position to give you an update on this specific scheme, but I think our concerns about the Russians potentially resorting to these tactics, the same sort of false flag tactics that they have – that they did resort to in the past, those concerns are still very present.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay, you know one gets the impression that an attack or an invasion is imminent, it’s just a question of time, maybe a few days, mid-month, whatever. So on the scale of one to ten – I know you guys like this – what is the likelihood of invasion? Is it about seven? Is it about eight? Are we today closer to nine, let’s say, than we were last week?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I am going to refer you to Vladimir Putin. Again, we have put forward these two paths. It is our strong, strong preference that we pursue the path of diplomacy and dialogue. What I will say and what you heard the National Security Advisor speak to yesterday is that we are now in the window, given what we have seen from the Russians over weeks and even longer now – amassing troops along Ukraine’s borders, dispatching forces into Belarus, taking other steps that have positioned them to move forward at any moment if they so choose.</p>
<p>We do not yet believe that Vladimir Putin has made a decision. It is our goal in all of this, including what I was discussing with Matt just a moment ago, to deter an invasion. If we’re not able to deter an invasion, we will then resort to the other path. It’s a path of hefty, stark consequences for Russia. It’s also a path of defense for our allies on the eastern flank of NATO.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Are you aware of reports where a high-level Russian officer – or the head of the officers school, whatever it is – warned Putin against the invasion of Ukraine?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I’ve seen these reports. I understand that there was an open letter, so I’ve certainly seek that – seen that. Again, I don’t have a specific comment on it. Our goal is to solve conflicts through diplomacy. We’re seeking to do that for the good of the American people, the good of Ukrainian people, the good of the Russian people, and people all throughout Europe, knowing that any renewed invasion of Ukraine would carry tremendous costs, tremendous costs across many realms. It’s our goal to do everything we can to avoid that.</p>
<p>Yes, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>You just said in your answer to Matt that if you have to put forward incomplete information to deter an attack, then so be it. What were you referring to there? I mean, is the intelligence behind this video perhaps incomplete?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, I was referring to the fact that there have been demands for everything we have in our possession behind this intelligence, and that’s not something we’re able to provide, again, because of our desire not to jeopardize sources and methods, our desire not to jeopardize &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, if you’re referring to me, that’s not true. I asked for literally, quote/unquote, any shred of evidence – not even proof, because not all evidence is proof. I asked for anything. I didn’t ask for everything. I didn’t ask for sources or methods. I just asked &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I think &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>&#8212; for anything that would back it up. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>The challenge, Matt, is that by divulging details, further details, you would necessarily get into sources and methods. And so that is why we’re in the position of putting forward what we know in a way that we consider to be responsible vis-à-vis our objectives going forward, and one of those objectives going forward is to protect our ability to collect this kind of information going forward. We are trying to strike a very difficult balance. There are – when it comes to national security and the tension, the inherent tension between national security and transparency, there is never an easy formula. Not always do we get it right. No administration has always gotten it right, but we are leaning forward here.</p>
<p>The only reason we’re having this discussion is because we publicized some of what was in our possession. We could have kept that to ourselves. It would have made for a much less memorable briefing last Thursday, but that wasn’t the responsible thing in our estimation to do. Again, we want to make sure at the end of the day, whether we are able to deter an invasion or whether in the aftermath of an invasion, that we have done everything we responsibly can to do that. And one of the tactics we’ve used, one of the tactics I would say we’ve used probably more so than previous administrations, is declassifying information or making public information that previously was not public. That is not something that – it is not something that administrations have done certainly to this degree.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>You also say that we’re in the window now where an attack might happen. You’ve said it repeatedly that an attack is imminent.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We’ve never said repeatedly that an attack is imminent. We have said that we are now in the window where if &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I think numerous times you’ve used the word “imminent.”</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We – we have said that if Vladimir Putin decides to move &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Inaudible) and 50,000 people are going to be dead. What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I can’t be accountable for what others write. What we have said &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>What others write?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>What &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And “imminent” is a word that has been used.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>What we have said is that if Vladimir Putin decides to go forward with an invasion, they have now positioned themselves to the degree that they’re able to do that whether it is within a day, within a couple weeks. They have now reached that point.</p>
<p>But imminent suggests that this is a foregone conclusion, that this is a certainty. So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No one in the administration has used the word “imminent” to describe &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I think what you might have heard is potentially imminent. That &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>What – if an invasion were imminent, we would not be prioritizing diplomacy and dialogue the way we have. Imminence suggests that this is a foregone conclusion, that there is no way to avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I think if you’ve been listening to what we’ve been saying for the past two months now, the emphasis we’ve placed on dialogue and diplomacy, the emphasis that we’ve placed on deterring an invasion, the emphasis that we have placed on finding a diplomatic way out of this, you would understand that we’re not talking about something that is a foregone conclusion. We are talking about something that is one of two paths. We’ve consistently talked about one of two paths. It’s certainly possible that Vladimir Putin will choose that path. It is our hope that he will choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue, that we can avoid the bloodshed, that we can avoid the violence, that we can avoid the destabilizing forces that would descend not only on Ukraine but well beyond in terms of the implications.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>My question was actually going to be: Considering that we are in that window now and there’s talk of a potentially imminent invasion, was there ever a discussion about postponing the Australia trip? Is now the right time to be crossing the world, going to Fiji, when this invasion could happen at any time?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Ben, we are a big country. We are a big department. We have a lot of challenges on our plate. The Secretary of State is the Secretary of State wherever in the world he is. He has access to secure communications wherever in the world he is. He, I’m sure, will be focused to a large degree on this challenge even while he is in the Indo-Pacific. It will certainly come up in conversations with counterparts in the Quad and elsewhere, but I can assure you, you will also see that he will remain active on the phones with our interagency counterparts. He and we are capable of – again, not to use an overused metaphor, but of walking and chewing gum at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Sorry, Ned, but the Secretary said &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And juggling.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>And juggling.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>The Secretary said that Ukraine is prepared to give special status in the Donbas region.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>He was referring to the – he was referring to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Is that, like, sort of walking back from the – that sort of thing?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, it was – it is reiterating what’s in the Minsk Agreements. The Minsk Agreements spell out a means by which to de-escalate the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. Special status is a term that’s used in the Minsk Agreements.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Ben.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>After you made the accusation last week – the administration – about this false flag operation and then the reassessments leaked over the weekend, the Ukrainian foreign minister tweeted today, “Do not believe the apocalyptic predictions. Different capitals are calculating different scenarios.” Is he wrong that there isn’t this sort of apocalyptic situation that you all are discussing?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We see eye to eye with our Ukrainian partners in the sense that now is not the time for panic. What we are calling for, what we are doing is moving forward with preparation. We want to be prepared and we need to position ourselves to be prepared regardless of which path it is that Vladimir Putin takes. It’s our hope that we pursue that of dialogue and diplomacy. It is certainly possible that we are not able to deter an invasion and not able to deter renewed aggression and that we’ll have to be prepared for that path of defense and deterrence.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But, I mean, you say that you’re seeing eye to eye. He’s saying that what you’re saying is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t think you’ve heard us use the term “cataclysmic,” if that’s – if that was the quote.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> “Apocalyptic.”</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> “Apocalyptic.”</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But he was specifically referring to what U.S. officials have said in recent days, in the last week.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I – the Ukrainian ambassador to Washington has spoken to this; President Zelenskyy has spoken to our coordination with the Ukrainian Government. What we are doing is engaged in prudent preparation. We are doing that with our European allies but also with our Ukrainian partners.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> When the Secretary and Foreign Minister Kuleba spoke on Friday, did the foreign minister express any of these concerns to the Secretary?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Again, we issued a readout of that call, so I don’t have anything to add beyond that readout. We have a close relationship with Ukraine. Ukraine, of course, is a close partner of ours. We can speak candidly with close partners when it comes to our concerns. Our Ukrainian partners, our European allies, and others, they know of the basis for our concerns. Number one, they hear what we say publicly in the same way you do, but we are also in a position to share some of that underlying information with our European allies, with other allies, as well as with our Ukrainian partners.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one last question on this. During – in the Ukrainian readout as well, it said that the Secretary reaffirmed the U.S. was working to provide additional economic assistance to the Ukrainian Government. Can you say anything more about that? What’s on the table, dollar amount, or if anything is forthcoming?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, so we have said for some time now that even as we work to provide Ukraine with security assistance, we know that this – certainly Russian aggression, even the threat of Russian aggression, could have a toll on Ukraine’s economy. So we have provided half a billion dollars in development and humanitarian assistance in the past year. We are exploring additional macroeconomic support to help Ukraine’s economy amidst pressure resulting from Russia’s military buildup.</p>
<p>Last week, on February 3rd, we and several of our allies and partners announced a new partnership fund for a resilient Ukraine. It’s a fund that bolsters the resilience and perseverance of communities in eastern Ukraine, those communities that are in some ways bearing the brunt, have borne the brunt of Russia’s aggression. USAID has a expert in the country who’s monitoring the situation closely, coordinating with other donors, assessing the evolving humanitarian needs of the Ukrainian people, and liaising with partners to ensure that they are able to rapidly scale up assistance should the need arise.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we and Ukraine have finalized a memorandum of understanding on commercial cooperation. It’s a memorandum, MOU, designed to facilitate commercial participation by U.S. companies across the Ukrainian economy and by Ukrainian companies here in the United States.</p>
<p>And then finally, the EXIM, the Export-Import Bank, has made available $3 billion in support for projects in Ukraine, and the DFC, the Development Finance Corporation, has a current investment portfolio in Ukraine of approximately $800 million across more than a dozen projects. Those range from renewable energy to higher education and access to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>Rosiland.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Stay on Ukraine?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m going to take off my mask because I can’t hear when I wear this. You keep talking about we want to resolve this diplomatically. There are reports that the Ukrainians have asked the U.S. to station some THAAD anti-missile systems in the eastern part of the country, ostensibly to guard against any Russian missile attacks. The UK has decided to deploy 350 Royal Marines to Poland. Are these kinds of actions the thing that the West wants to be telegraphing if it wants Moscow to actually resolve all of these issues about Ukraine and about NATO’s posture? I mean, how does that – how does moving troops and possibly stationing anti-missile systems actually get you what you want?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure. So I can’t speak to moves that haven’t been announced, that are hypothetical, that may not come to pass. But what I can speak to is what we’ve announced, and everything we have announced has been in the vein of defense and deterrence, across the board. Whether it is our security assistance for Ukraine – the $650 million that was provided last year – that is defensive security assistance; whether it is the authorization for our NATO Allies to pass U.S.-origin material to Ukraine, that is defensive material.</p>
<p>When it comes to the service members who have been put on heightened state of readiness should they be called upon by the North Atlantic Council, that would be in the vein of defense and deterrence. When it comes to the service members who are being sent to offer reassurance and sent to deter further Russian aggression against – or Russian aggression, I should say – against NATO’s eastern flank, that is done in the vein of defense and deterrence.</p>
<p>Everything we are doing is in an effort to see to it that we are not faced with a renewed Russian invasion, that Russian aggression does not move forward. Now, we are doing all of this also knowing that in the end, Vladimir Putin may choose the path of conflict, of an invasion, of renewed aggression. But we are doing, as I was saying to Matt and to others earlier, everything we can in an effort to in the first instance deter, but also to send a very clear signal that we stand by our commitments under Article 5 when it comes to protecting our NATO Allies, that the United States will live up to its obligations, the United States will continue to provide the sort of defensive security assistance that Ukraine needs to defend itself.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But deploying a THAAD system is a pretty serious deal. I mean, think about the controversy in Korea, where they have asked for the systems and it’s engendered a lot of uproar as well as criticism from Pyongyang.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Again, I can’t speak to measures that haven’t been announced or that remain hypothetical.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Let me also ask you about Macron’s meeting with Putin today. What sense does the U.S. have about what Macron was going to try to bring up once the cameras left the meeting room? Has Ambassador Sullivan and his team been able to get a readout from the French on how willing Putin is to back away in this crisis?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, when it comes to the engagement of our partners, let me make the broader point that over the past month-plus, we have heard from our European allies, we have heard from our Ukrainian partners, we’ve heard from others an appreciation for what the United States has been doing with Russia diplomatically, and that includes in our bilateral engagement. And in expressing that appreciation and understanding, we’ve heard from our allies and partners that they have taken that approach because we have done all of this in a manner that is thoroughly coordinated, that has been consultative in its approach with our allies and partners, and that is conducted in full transparency with them. “Nothing about without” is not just a mantra for us, it is the guiding principle in terms of how we have conducted ourselves, including in this – in our bilateral engagements with Russia.</p>
<p>So, similarly, we would welcome any diplomatic efforts that are conducted in a similar manner that have the potential – excuse me – to de-escalate the crisis that Moscow has needlessly precipitated. When it comes to the<a id="post-312152-FRANCERUSSIA"></a> French, as you know, President Biden yesterday had an opportunity to speak to President Macron. This would be his second conversation with the French president in several days. Secretary Blinken yesterday spoke to the foreign minister, Foreign Minister Le Drian. We are well coordinated across the board, and that includes with the French, with Paris.</p>
<p>The result of all of this is that the message President Putin is hearing from the United States, from NATO, from our allies and partner – partners, it is loud and it is singular, and that is the fact that a diplomatic solution is the only responsible path. But again, if Russia chooses otherwise, we will be prepared. We will be prepared with a response that is swift, severe, and united. I saw President Macron made comments just before he left. You will hear those same messages from the French president.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And is the U.S. confident that once Chancellor Scholz goes to Moscow next week that that same unified message is going to be delivered? Because Germany is in a slightly different position than other countries in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, as luck would have it, C<a id="post-312152-GERMANYRUSSIA"></a>hancellor Scholz is in Washington today. He’s at the White House today. But I should say this is not luck, the fact that Chancellor Scholz is here to have these consultations with President Biden, a follow-on to the consultations and the discussions that the two leaders have had over the phone and over video conference in recent weeks. This is a testament to the close and continued coordination and cooperation with our European allies across the board – board, excuse me – including, of course, with Germany. So I expect you’ll be hearing a lot more about that today from the President and chancellor.</p>
<p>Yes, in the back.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, I’d like to ask about proximity of Vladimir Putin and Latin America. So last week the Argentinian President Alberto Fernández was in Moscow, and in the coming days the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro will be there. And there are reports in Brazil about the fact that the U.S. is putting pressure on Bolsonaro to cancel his trip to Russia. I would like you to elaborate a bit about the concerns and the reasons why the U.S. wants Brazil to skip this trip to Russia, and if the U.S. has the same confidence that – you talked about France – that you are well coordinated when we are talking about the Brazilian visit to Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we engage with our<a id="post-312152-BRAZILRUSSIA"></a> Brazilian partners on – at multiple levels regularly. We are, of course, aware of the reports of President Bolsonaro’s travel plans. We and many other nations around the world, including in this hemisphere, are deeply concerned about the potentially destabilizing role that Russia is playing and its ongoing threat to sovereignty and to territorial integrity, including, of course, in Ukraine.</p>
<p>As democratic countries – the United States, Brazil, Argentina, others in the region and beyond – we have a responsibility to stand up for democratic principles and for the rules-based order. This is the same order that has undergirded unprecedented levels of stability, of security, of prosperity over the past 70 years, and that is true – it is equally true in Europe as it is in the Western Hemisphere, as it is in the Indo-Pacific. So we know that Brazil and other countries in the region – you mentioned Argentina as well – we share values. That is one of the hallmarks of our relationship, and we have – we know that those values will be conveyed and will undergird concerns that President Putin hears not only from the United States but our partners around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But what does the U.S. expect from this Brazilian visit to Moscow?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It’s not for us to speak to what – the goals that President Bolsonaro may have in mind. I am confident that there will be discussions both before and after the trip with our Brazilian partners.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, and if China pledges it support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as North Korea, what actions will the United States take against China for this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sorry. Could you clarify the question?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. China pledged to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as North Korea. What actions will the United States take against China?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, so if you’re asking about the relationship between <a id="post-312152-CHINARUSSIA"></a>Russia and China, I know that this is something that our Assistant Secretary for Asia and Pacific Affairs Dan Kritenbrink spoke to last week. But what we have seen over the course not of days, not of weeks, but of years and probably longer, is an approach that both of these countries have taken for some time, and that is an increasing closeness between Russia and China.</p>
<p>It would be our hope, given the implications of a renewed Russian aggression and certainly Russian invasion of Ukraine, that the PRC would have taken advantage of dialogue, of this relationship, to encourage Russia to pursue the course of diplomacy and de-escalation. This is what the world expects of responsible powers.</p>
<p>The Secretary had a conversation with Foreign Minister Wang of the PRC the other week – the other day, I should say – and there was a discussion of the potential for renewed Russian aggression, renewed Russian invasion, of Ukraine, and the fact that it would not only have implications in Ukraine, not only in Europe, but in many ways it would be a threat to peace and security around the world because it would be a flagrant violation of the same rules-based international order that applies equally in the Indo-Pacific as it does in Europe.</p>
<p>If in the end China is seen as having supported Russia’s move to choose conflict or war over diplomacy, it will cost China in terms of how it’s seen in the eyes of the world. It will have an effect on the PRC’s global reputation. We – as Russia and China talk about a singular partnership, we are focused with our 29 NATO Allies, we are working with the EU, we are working with our allies in the Indo-Pacific and partners around the world to not only incentivize and to work towards a diplomatic resolution, but also to be in a position to respond decisively if Russia does choose the path of aggression.</p>
<p>We told you last month of – we listed out many of the engagements that we’ve had with partners and allies. That tally has now grown to some 200 phone calls, in-person meetings, video conferences. Of course, one of them you saw today when Secretary Blinken hosted High Representative Josep Borrell of the EU.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>On North Korea, UN sanctions monitors reported to the Security Council that cyber attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions by North Korea were an important revenue source for North Korea to fund its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. What is the United States doing to try and stop this, and does the U.S. believe North Korea’s receiving any outside help to help carry out these cyber attacks?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I don’t have any assessment to offer from here in terms of outside support or assistance that <a id="post-312152-NORTHKOREA2"></a>North Korea may be receiving. What I can say generally without speaking to any specific report at this time is that North Korea’s activity and behavior in cyberspace has long been a serious concern of the United States. We have in the past disclosed and attributed malicious attacks to the DPRK – the attack in 2014, I believe it was, that the DPRK perpetrated against a private American company, a destructive attack against Sony may be an instructive case in point for some of the capabilities and some of the behavior that the DPRK has exhibited in cyberspace.</p>
<p>So it is not just the DPRK’s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. It is – it is not just its record on human rights. There are other profound concerns we have, including its behavior in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Yes, Ben. Welcome to – yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>With the restoration – with the restoration of the sanctions waiver on<a id="post-312152-IRAN"></a> Iran, which is akin to lifting sanctions in the sense that it enriches them to a certain degree &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, it does not, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>But wasn’t that &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>But it – that’s not true. It does not do that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, was the restoration of the sanctions waiver in any way an incentive to get them back to the table and continue negotiations?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So to be very clear, what you said was not true. The issuance of the so-called IFCA waiver in no way enriches Iran. This is about two things. This is about nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear safety. I would suspect most reasonable observers would agree that both of these things are in our vital national interest regardless of what happens with the JCPOA, if we’re able to achieve a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA or if we’re not. We decided to renew and to restore this sanctions waiver to do one thing, and that is to enable third-party participation in nuclear non-proliferation and safety projects in Iran, owing to the growing proliferation concerns we have, in particular with respect to the increasing stockpiles of enriched uranium in Iran, the stockpiles that have grown following the last administration’s decision to abandon the JCPOA.</p>
<p>Absent this waiver, the sort of detailed technical discussions with third parties regarding the disposition of stockpiles and other activities of non-proliferation value, they couldn’t take place. The Trump administration, as you know, provided a similar waiver for years even after its foolish decision to leave the JCPOA, precisely because the last administration recognized the non-proliferation value of these waivers. I don’t know that I’ve quoted Secretary Pompeo before from here, but Secretary Pompeo said about this waiver, quote, “This decision will help…reduce proliferation risks.”</p>
<p>So additionally, the technical discussions facilitated by the waiver are necessary in the final weeks of JCPOA talks, as the waiver itself would be essential if we were be in a position – to be in a position to – if Iran were to resume compliance with its nuclear commitments. But again, even if talks do not culminate in a mutual return to compliance, these sorts of technical discussions could still contribute to our non-proliferation goals.</p>
<p>Non-proliferation, nuclear safety – these things may not mean a lot to a whole lot of people. So just to give you a few examples of activities that these waivers – this waiver would cover: for example, the modernization of the Arak reactor based on the design approved by the JCPOA, the conversion of the reactor to a much less proliferation-sensitive design. This waiver would approve the preparation and modification of the Fordow facility for stable isotope production. It would remove a potential impediment to efforts to end uranium enrichment at Fordow, as Iran committed to do under the JCPOA. It would facilitate the transfer outside Iran of enriched uranium to result in a reduction in Iran’s stockpile to no more than 300 kilograms of up to 3.67 percent enriched LEU.</p>
<p>I could go on, but the point is that this waiver is not about providing Iran with funds. This waiver is about what is manifestly in our nonproliferation interests, in our – in service of nonproliferation safety to the United States, to our partners and allies around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can you talk about the timing of it, though, and why the decision was taken on Friday?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did it have anything to do with &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, the fact is if we are in a position to resume compliance with the JCPOA, this waiver will need to be in place in order to effect some of the steps to make Iran’s nuclear program less dangerous. If we are not in a position to achieve a mutual return to compliance, these are still – these steps are still in our interest.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What makes you think that that next step that they are – that we’re one step closer to rejoining the JCPOA then?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I didn’t say that we were. I’m saying that this prepares us in the event we are able to achieve a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA. This could still very much go one of two ways: a mutual return to compliance if Iran is in a position and willing and able to make the sort of political commitments necessary; or the alternatives that we’ve talked about in some less deal – detail but that we still talked about.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, are you – that long list of things that you said that these waivers give, you’re saying that there’s no benefit to Iran in any of that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I am saying that the net benefit of this is a nonproliferation benefit for us.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Iran gets nothing out of it?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> When you say sanctions waiver &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m not talking about – hold on a second.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, you don’t need to raise your voice. You don’t &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But you’re the one – you’re the one who – you guys are the ones who said you were restoring the waivers, right? Okay. So if Iran really gets no benefit at all out of this, then why even bother?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Why bother? I just explained to Ben. Because if &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, well, you – tell me why Iran doesn’t benefit from this.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, this is something that redounds &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You’re talking about – you’re assuming that everyone thinks that sanctions relief equals dollars &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, that was the question.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; going to Iran.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The question was you just waived &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It was.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> That wasn’t really the question.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It was.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> That was the way you interpreted the question.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> You can refer to the transcript.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So sanctions relief does not necessarily mean only dollar bills flying across the table into Iran – into the Iranian treasury’s coffers, does it? Or is &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> In this case, it will allow Iran to undertake nuclear nonproliferation and safety activities that would otherwise be proscribed.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, which is a benefit to Iran that it was not getting before.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The fact is, Matt, that what is in our nonproliferation interest can also be, in some ways, in Iran’s interest. That doesn’t change the fact that it is manifestly in our interest.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do they – so do they get a benefit of &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, I was referring to the sort &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do they get any benefit out of this or not?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It is – some of these steps redound to their interest.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do they get any benefit or not?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> This is in our interest to do, which is precisely why the last &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is it in Iran’s interest as well?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; which is why the last administration did it. In 2018, Secretary Pompeo, as I quoted before, said precisely this decision will help reduce proliferation &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And two years later – and two years later when he rescinded the waivers, he said that – he accused of Iran of taking – of participating in nuclear blackmail and said that they weren’t – that they weren’t deserving of the benefits that accrue to them under this.</p>
<p>You’re stuck on this idea that – and interesting that you used the word “enrich” because I think you’re talking about it in terms of money, but enrichment obviously has a different kind of meaning when it comes to Iran. But I don’t understand how you can say that Iran gets no benefit and that this isn’t some kind of sanctions relief that you – that the administration has offered to Iran before it has made any of its own concessions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, the question I was responding to took this in a vein &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Well, then, forget about the question you were &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; you think you were responding to. Answer my question: Does Iran benefit at all from the waivers that were signed?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> You will need to ask the Iranian Government whether they think this is a benefit to them. We know &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, who do you think this benefits? Just you?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We know this is of benefit to us. The ability of third-party entities to work on nuclear nonproliferation projects &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, I’m sorry, now is the U.S. &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; and nuclear safety projects in Iran in the face of our growing concerns, nonproliferation and nuclear safety concerns – that is in our benefit, yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The people that this benefits, in fact, are actually Russian, Chinese, European companies, right? Is that what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, I am saying that it is manifestly to our advantage &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And not Iran’s?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It benefits us to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Well, if you can argue that &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; be able to address nuclear safety and nuclear nonproliferation concerns on Iran.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> If you’re able to argue that Iran gets no benefit out of this successfully, which you haven’t convinced me of, but anyway – but if you’re able to, then good on you. Now, do you think that these waivers trigger INARA?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Matt, we have a robust conversation with Congress on progress in Vienna. We have briefed Congress regularly on the discussions. I have every expectations that those briefings will continue in the days and weeks ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, do you believe that this triggers the requirements of the Iran Nuclear Review Act?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>What I can say is that we’ve had conversations with Congress about requirements should we be in a position to resume compliance with the JCPOA, but I don’t have anything for you on these particular – this IFCA waiver.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No, not IFCA. INARA.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Right, but you’re saying “these” in response to IFCA.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah. Well, so you’re aware of the requirements of INARA, right? That any agreement reached with Iran has to be submitted. Are you saying that it did trigger INARA and your notification to Congress on Friday fulfills the requirements of INARA?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, I’m not saying that. I’m saying &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Oh, well, then why did you even notify Congress in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We regularly notify Congress when it comes to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Laughter.) Okay. Well – so did it trigger INARA or not?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Matt, when it – we will carefully consider the facts and circumstances when it comes to any potential U.S. return to the JCPOA to determine the implications under INARA.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So you don’t think that this falls under the scope of INARA.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I have no reason to believe that this was done pursuant to INARA. This is something we, as I said before, we regularly engage with Congress when it comes to developments in Vienna &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, it’s a technical issue. I get that, and probably boring the hell out of everybody, but it is an important one, because if it – even if the notification wasn’t done under INARA, do you think that the waivers trigger the – trigger the INARA requirements for any agreement with Iran related to its nuclear program? These do relate to its nuclear program, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>This is, as you said, a technical question, so we’ll get you a technical answer.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Ned, why shouldn’t Iran benefit – why shouldn’t Iran benefit from the waiver? I mean, I thought the whole purpose of negotiations is so everybody goes back to the deal and sanctions will be lifted, Iran will pull back from any nuclear threat and so on, and everything will be hunky-dory. So why is that such a bad thing if Iran benefits?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>You’ll have to ask &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No, I’m asking you because you – you’re the one who’s &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I am not speaking to what Iran may be saying about this; I am speaking to the benefits that we accrue.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Isn’t that the incentive for Iran to go on in good faith in these negotiations and so on?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, the basic formula of the JCPOA, leaving aside Matt’s questioning about these specific measures, is in fact permanent, verifiable limits on Iran’s nuclear program in return for sanctions relief.</p>
<p>Francesco</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Do you have any indication that the talks resume tomorrow, that the Iranian negotiators are coming back empowered by the political decision you were expecting for &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We will have a better idea of that once the talks resume.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Wendy Sherman will be in Vienna for an OSCE meeting tomorrow. Will she meet with the U.S.-Iran team, any of the P5+1, or even the Iranians while there?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>She’s taking part virtually.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Oh, okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Thank you all very much.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>One more – sorry.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Okay, sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Is – are the <a id="post-312152-RUSSIAUKRAINE2"></a>Russians taking a little bit longer to respond to this – the U.S. proposal than anticipated?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>You’ll have to ask them. I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>No sense of any indigestion as they’re processing this &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>You will have to ask them about their gastrointestinal fortitude.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Can you just tell us what the AUKUS call that is on the schedule for this afternoon, I think, is about?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So we’ll have an opportunity – I do expect we’ll have a readout of the call. But in advance of the Secretary’s travel to the Indo-Pacific, this is just another opportunity for him to have a conversation with our<a id="post-312152-AUKUS"></a> AUKUS partners. They will, I suspect, discuss the work currently underway and the progress made in the implementation of some of the initiatives that we have talked about in the context of AUKUS. I don’t want to get ahead of that readout, but I think you will see one late this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>It’s the first follow-up at this level since AUKUS was announced, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>It’s been several months.</p>
<p>Yes, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Do you have any comment on China using a Uyghur to light the Olympic flame and what the State Department thinks?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Not specifically beyond the point that we’ve repeatedly made, that the P<a id="post-312152-CHINA"></a>RC has sought to – the PRC has sought to disguise the true reality of what is going on, what has gone on in Xinjiang – that is the ongoing genocide, those are the crimes against humanity, that’s the human rights abuses that have taken place there. But when it comes to their motives for choosing this specific individual, I’d have to refer you to them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Will Rob Malley be in Vienna tomorrow for the start of the talks?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>He is traveling to <a id="post-312152-IRAN2"></a>Vienna today. Thank you all very much.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 3:41 p.m.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States’ commitment to fighting corruption and promoting democracy, rule of law, and accountability in support of the people of Central America is ironclad. We believe these issues are key to a brighter future for Central America. To advance this priority, we are declassifying and publicizing the inclusion of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez on the United States’ Corrupt and Undemocratic Actors list, under Section 353 of the United States–Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act, as amended, which generally makes the listed individuals ineligible for visas and admission to the United States. The Department included Hernandez on the list effective July 1, 2021.</p>
<p>As detailed in our report to Congress, according to multiple, credible media reports, Juan Orlando Hernandez has engaged in significant corruption by committing or facilitating acts of corruption and narco-trafficking, and using the proceeds of illicit activity to facilitate political campaigns. In addition, Hernandez was identified by name in sworn witness testimony in a U.S. federal criminal proceeding as having received narco-trafficking proceeds as part of his campaign funding. The Department included Hernandez on the Corrupt and Undemocratic Actors list on July 1, 2021 and is now publicizing this status.</p>
<p>The United States continues to use the tools at its disposal to promote accountability for corruption and other attacks on the security, stability, and democratic aspirations of the people of Honduras, Central America, and the world. We will continue partnering with Honduran government officials and members of civil society and the private sector who show a dedication to combating corruption and strengthening democratic governance, including as part of an overall policy of addressing the root causes of irregular migration from the region. We will continue supporting the people of Honduras as they strive to contribute to and benefit from democratic institutions, generate equitable economic opportunities, and create the futures they desire for themselves and their families.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Josep Borrell, European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the European Commission</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Dean Acheson Auditorium</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>I was just checking to make sure I can say good afternoon.  It is good afternoon.  Good afternoon, everyone.  And let me first start by thanking the High Representative Josep Borrell, Josep my friend, for traveling to Washington today for a meeting of the U.S.-EU Energy Council.  The timing could not be more important; this is a pivotal moment.</p>
<p>As President Biden and European Commission President von der Leyen described in their joint statement just a couple of weeks ago, we’re working together right now to protect Europe’s energy supply against supply shocks including those that could result from further Russian aggression against Ukraine.  Energy security is tied directly to national security, regional security, global security.  Europe needs reliable and affordable energy, especially in the winter months.</p>
<p>When Russia halted gas supplies to Europe over a dispute with Ukraine in 2009, people died from the cold.  And when energy supplies fail, economies falter.  We’re determined to prevent that from happening and to mitigate the impact on energy supplies and prices should Russia choose to cut natural gas supplies to Europe more than it already has.  For example, we’re talking with governments and major producers around the world about surging their production and distribution capacity; we’re coordinating with our allies and partners, with energy sector stakeholders, including about how best to share energy reserves in the event that Russia turns off the spigot or initiates a conflict that disrupts the flow of gas through Ukraine.</p>
<p>This is part of broader coordination between Europe and the United States during this crisis and, indeed, beyond this crisis.  We and our allies and partners are united across the board.  We’ve listened to Russia’s concerns and shared concerns of our own about the steps that they’re taking to undermine security.  The United States, the European Union, our NATO Allies, our OSCE partners throughout Europe have put forward ideas about how we and Russia can find common agreement that will strengthen collective security for everyone.  I reiterated this in my conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov a few days ago; others have reinforced these same concerns directly with Moscow.  We and our allies and partners have done so collectively at NATO, at the OSCE.</p>
<p>We’re all driving the same message:  We’re willing to continue a substantive conversation with Russia on mutual security concerns.  The diplomatic path is clear.  At the same time, we and our allies are resolved that there will be real and profound consequences should Russia choose to continue aggression.  We’ve developed a high-impact, quick action response that would inflict massive costs on the Russian economy and financial system, including sanctions and significant export controls that would have a long-term effect in denying Russia the technology that it needs in key sectors.  And we’re working closely with the EU as they prepare complementary actions.</p>
<p>At the same time, we continue to work closely with Congress and with allies and partners to significantly increase assistance to Ukraine to help it prepare to defend itself.  We’ve provided Ukraine with $650 million in security assistance last year, more than in any previous year; we authorized allies to provide U.S. origin equipment; we’ve deployed forces and put more on a heightened state of readiness to shore up NATO’s eastern flank; and we’re working with partners to support the Ukrainian economy.</p>
<p>We’ve done all of this through constant coordination, some 200 engagements to date by phone, screen, in-person.  What happens next will depend on whether President Putin will choose to engage in a meaningful path forward on diplomacy for enhanced collective security or if he will choose the path of further conflict with Ukraine.  Either way – either way, the United States and our allies and partners are prepared.</p>
<p>As we’ve done many times before, we’re acting in unity to defend the principles that have been at the core of security, stability, and prosperity for decades in Europe and beyond.  We can see that across our cooperation with the European Union, including our work together to support resilient infrastructure and developing economies through Build Back Better World and the EU’s Global Gateway, to boost the supply of vaccines and treatments to end the COVID-19 pandemic, and through the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council we’re shaping emerging technologies so that they enhance our democracies, not undermine them.  Today’s meeting of the U.S.-EU Energy Council has continued vital work that we’re doing together both to build energy security and also to advance the critical work of responding to the climate crisis and pursuing new technologies, renewable energy, and doing that together.</p>
<p>When the EU and the United States are working together, we have a tremendous capacity to lead the world.  Together our economies represent about 45 percent of world GDP.  When we’re acting in concert we can move others, motivate others, and actually deal effectively with the challenges that are before our people and people around the world.  So I was particularly pleased to have this opportunity to focus today on energy, but almost quite literally every day in the work that we’re doing together.  Thank you.</p>
<p>Josep.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:</strong>  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Secretary of State, dear Tony.  It’s great to be here in Washington again and to meet again also in person after we have been in close contact over the past weeks.  As you have said, we have been on speed-dial mode, and it’s good because we have been coordinating a lot during those days.</p>
<p>And today’s discussion after our bilateral meeting has been about energy on the EU-U.S. Energy Council, and this has demonstrated again our strong transatlantic unity on geopolitical questions and around climate and energy issues.  This meeting could have not been more timely.  This ninth meeting of the Energy Council, after four years without meeting, has been a good occasion to deal with the current circumstances of the threats that Russia is putting on the eastern borders of Europe.</p>
<p>Our joint work is needed to accelerate a green energy transition to become neutral from the point of view of our climate in the future.  In the medium term, there is the climate neutrality.  In the short term, it’s security of supplies of gas.  Both things go together.  We need to face the current situation in the eastern border keeping in mind the purpose of decarbonizing our energy mix, because the only lasting solution to energy resilience, security, is going from fossil fuels to renewables.  It is the best way of facing the challenge of climate change.</p>
<p>Today our environment is characterized by the geopolitical turbulence in the context of Russia and Crimea crisis, and energy issues are central to this crisis because Russia doesn’t hesitate to use the significant energy supplies to Europe as the leverage for geopolitical gains.  And when gas prices in European Union have been increasing from 6 to 10 times higher than they were a year ago – 10 times higher than one year ago – this has a major impact on consumers and on the competitivity of the economy.</p>
<p>That’s why our immediate priority to diversify the sources of energy, in particular the gas flows, to avoid supply disruption from our main supplier, who is Russia, and to ensure that the world energy markets will be liquid, competitive, and well-supplied.  Keep in mind that for Europe, our dependency from gas is about 95 percent of our consumption, oil 97 percent, coal 70 percent.  These figures are a good indicator of the need of shifting our energy mix to renewables.</p>
<p>Today, dear Tony, we have sent a strong message of our joint determination to bolster energy security in Europe and in our direct neighborhood, and thinking on Ukraine but also on the Western Balkans.  As to the current crisis around Ukraine, we have seen eye-to-eye our determination to give a united response to Russia’s threats.  This is our best asset.</p>
<p>We have repeated our call to Russia to de-escalate.  Our multilayered diplomatic engagement will continue on various levels and in different formats, as bilateral contacts, the Normandy talks, the OSCE, and NATO.  We certainly at the European Union, we welcome the elements outlined in the U.S. and NATO responses to the Russian demands on European security coordination with the U.S. and NATO.  I think it’s exemplary and shows our unity and determination.</p>
<p>We believe that the diplomatic way out of the crisis is still possible, and this is our clear and first priority, and that’s what we are investing all our efforts.  But at the same time, we remain firm in our resolve that further aggression against Ukraine would have, as the Secretary of State said, massive consequences, and we hope for the best, but we prepare for the worst.  Should Russia continue on a path of aggression, the European Union and the United States actions will be closely aligned, including on sanctions.</p>
<p>Let me stress how important is Ukraine for us.  It is a strategic partner.  We have been supporting Ukraine since Russia grasped Crimea with more than €17 billion.  And this week we have provided another 1.5 billion in macro financial assistance.  We are helping them in countering cyber and hybrid threats, strengthen the capabilities of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and tackling disinformation.</p>
<p>To conclude, let me express my appreciation to you, the U.S. Secretary of State, for the excellent cooperation over the last week in tackling so many challenges, and that’s what we are going to continue doing.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>We’ll now take two questions.  The first question goes to the BBC, Barbara Usher.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  Good afternoon.  A question about diplomacy for you, Mr. Blinken.  The U.S. and Europe are pushing Minsk as the solution while Ukraine is completely against it.  Do you still think a measure of autonomy for Donbas, the autonomy stipulated in the agreement, is the way to go?</p>
<p>And a question for you, Mr. Borrell.  You’re welcome to comment on that as well, but with regards to security does the EU agree with the U.S. assessment that a potential imminent invasion of Ukraine is in the cards?  If so, why isn’t the EU raising the same alarm as the Americans?  And if not, do you have a different assessment of the situation?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you, Barbara.  I’m happy to start.</p>
<p>With regard to Minsk, the United States and Ukraine are united in believing that Minsk is the path forward to resolve the conflict in the Donbas that was created by Russia’s invasion in 2014, and the best way to restore Ukraine’s border, to restore its sovereignty, as well as to uphold the rights of Ukrainian citizens, including those living in the Donbas.</p>
<p>Repeatedly over the last years, Ukraine has sought to move forward with the implementation of Minsk.  The Normandy Format, as it’s called with France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia involved has been the principal vehicle for trying to advance that.  I think if you look back over the requirements established in the Minsk Agreements, three agreements over the course of several months, it is a fair assessment to say that Ukraine has sought to move forward on most if not all of them, while Russia has made good on virtually none of its obligations under Minsk.</p>
<p>But in all of my conversations with our Ukrainian counterparts, they remain committed to it.  There was recently a meeting of senior officials in the Normandy Format.  Ukraine continues to put forward good-faith ideas on how to move forward.  Minsk does not spell out some issues of sequencing when it comes to the steps that the parties need to take.  Ukraine has been approaching this in good faith.  We have not to date seen Russia do the same.</p>
<p>The agreements speak of special status for the Donbas, and I believe that with the appropriate sequencing, the Ukrainians would be prepared to move forward.  But again, the overall picture on Minsk since 2014 has been one in which Ukraine has sought to move forward on most of its requirements and commitments; Russia has not.  So if Russia is serious about implementing Minsk, I think it will find a strong partner in Ukraine, and France and Germany are helping to lead this effort.  There&#8217;s supposed to be another meeting of the – in the Normandy Format in the next couple of weeks.  I hope Russia will demonstrate a seriousness of purpose.  There are some near-term steps that could be taken to continue to build confidence in – toward the implementation of Minsk.  We have one of them that&#8217;s already more or less in place, which is a ceasefire that brings things back to the levels of 2020.  It hasn&#8217;t been perfect, but it&#8217;s definitely been an improvement over what we were seeing just a few weeks ago, so that&#8217;s encouraging.</p>
<p>The Ukrainians have also talked about having a release of prisoners on both sides, and making sure as well that across the line of contact people can move much more freely.  Unfortunately, that&#8217;s been blocked by those on the separatist side.  I think that would be a good way to show seriousness of purpose, and then to pursue the actual implementation of the accords.  But bottom line is Ukraine is committed to Minsk.  If Russia is too, then I believe there&#8217;s a way to move forward and resolve this conflict.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Some in Ukraine are saying that the level of autonomy would be disruptive to your country.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>This is all for discussion and in progress.  Again, the Minsk Agreements talk about special status, but there are myriad other requirements that go to security, that go to restoring Ukraine&#8217;s border, that go to steps that unfortunately continue to be taken primarily by the Russian and separatist side that need to be addressed.  And I believe that those are addressed and addressed pursuant to what was agreed in 2014.  There&#8217;s a way to resolve this through the Minsk Agreements.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:  </strong>Thank you for your question.  We share a strong concern about the risk that are accumulating in the Ukrainian-Russian border.  And certainly, we are living, to my understanding, the most dangerous moment for the security in Europe after the end of the Cold War.  But at the same time, we believe that there is still room for diplomacy, there is still room for discussing, for knowing which are the concerns of everybody, also the Russian concerns, in order to avoid the worst.  Be prepared for the worst, and try to avoid it.</p>
<p>Nobody masses 104,000 soldiers heavily armed in the border of a country at the same time that you state about independency of this country in a way that certainly represents a strong threat –140,000 troops massed in the border is not to go to have tea.  So we have to increase our efforts in order to avoid a big risk for the peace and security.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>(Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:  </strong>I haven&#8217;t finished yet.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:  </strong>Minister Lavrov has sent a letter to all members of the European Union, to the member states, about it, asking for taking into consideration the security concerns of Russia.  I am coordinating the answer to this letter, and I insisting on the fact that there is still room for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Do you think that telegraphing the alarm about a potential invasion works against diplomatic efforts, the success of diplomatic efforts?</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:  </strong>With the mask, it is difficult to understand you.  Can &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Do you think that telegraphing the alarm so much about the potential of an invasion works against chances for a diplomatic solution?</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:  </strong>On one hand you have to warn about the situation, and on the other hand you have to work in order to solve the situation.  Both things go together.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Our next question will come from <em>El Pais</em>.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Thank you so much.  I have a question for High Representative Borrell and I – and also for Secretary Blinken.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:</strong>  Speak louder, because with the mask it’s difficult to understand.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary, for – question for High Representative Borrell and also Secretary Blinken.  It’s pretty much a follow-up question, actually.  The U.S. administration have been – has been sharing to the public several pieces of intelligence information or at least conclusions, and also specific sanctions regarding Russia&#8217;s intentions, and even how imminent an attack would be.  Do you think this can create alarmism, and do you think this is the smart strategy?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you.  First, let me say I’ve been reading <em>El Pais</em> very attentively, especially in recent days.  This is not alarmism; this is simply the facts.  We have to deal with the facts.  We have to deal with the facts in the context of history and we have to deal with the facts in making sure that we are fully prepared, and the facts are, as Josep said, that we have seen over the last few months a massing of Russian forces on Ukraine’s borders.  That’s not happening in a vacuum.  It’s happening in the context of what Russia already did in 2014 in invading Ukraine, seizing Crimea, creating a conflict in the Donbas that continues to this day.</p>
<p>So that’s what we’re seeing.  That’s what we’re looking at.  That’s what we’re responding to.  And we’ve made very clear as well that there are two paths before Russia.  One path is the path of diplomacy and dialogue that we have been pursuing together and in an effort to strengthen collective security for everyone.  We have deep concerns in the United States and Europe about many actions that Russia has taken over the years that undermine security.  Russia says it has concerns about us.  We have demonstrated that we’re fully prepared to address those concerns on a reciprocal basis and doing that in full and very close coordination.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, given the facts that we’re seeing, given the history that we know, we have to be prepared for what could happen.  We – we don’t believe that Mr. – President Putin has made a decision, but he has put in place the capacity should he so decide to act very quickly against Ukraine, and in ways that would have terrible consequences for Ukraine, for Russia, but consequences also for all of us, because these actions – this aggression, this threatened aggression against Ukraine – would undermine the core principles that were hard established after World War II and after the Cold War that have helped to protect security, stability, peace, and prosperity in Europe and beyond ever since, principles like one country can’t simply go in by force and change the borders of another.  One country can’t simply dictate to another its choices, its decisions, including about with whom it will associate.  One country cannot exert a sphere of influence over its neighbors to try to subjugate those neighbors to its will.</p>
<p>All of those things are at stake, and that’s why it’s been so important not just in terms of Ukraine, as important as that is, but in terms of the larger principles that are endangered by Russia’s conduct.  As Josep said, we strongly believe together in the United States and Europe that the preferred course – the responsible course – is to work through the differences that we have diplomatically and through dialogue, and we’ve demonstrated our commitment to do that.  But equally, we are prepared if Russia chooses the path of aggression.</p>
<p>We’ve worked incredibly closely together in the last months, as I mentioned, nearly 200 engagements among us that continue every single day, and I think it demonstrates a solidarity of purpose, a commitment to engage together on this either way that Russia chooses.  I have to say as well that here in the United States we’ve had very strong bipartisan support for Ukraine, for upholding these principles, for working together.  I spent time with Congress last week, and that was abundantly clear from Republican and Democratic members alike.  So we will see what President Putin decides, but either way, he is going to find a Europe and United States that are fully aligned, fully coordinating, fully cooperative.</p>
<p>Last point I’d just make:  You mentioned at the very beginning the disinformation campaign that we see Russia engaged in.  We believe – and it’s why we’ve spoken about it repeatedly – that the best antidote to disinformation is information, and that’s what we’ve sought to provide to the best of our ability.  We know that part of Russia’s playbook is to create false provocations as justification for acts that Russia was preparing to commit in any event, and so we’ve sought to put light on those, hopefully to deter them from happening, but at the very least so that if they do happen, no one is surprised and no one misinterprets what’s actually going on.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:</strong>  Well, at the beginning of the crisis, you remember, Tony, we had the phone call, and that’s when I said nothing should be agreed about European security without Europeans.  And I am very happy to say that since then we have been working very closely, I think more than ever.  This crisis has been pushing the transatlantic unity, and I am strongly satisfied of the participation of European Union on the (inaudible), the exchanges of positions among the U.S., the NATO, and Russia.</p>
<p>European Union is not a military association.  It’s not a military organization or union.  But we have a lot of strength on the civilian side.  And when we talk about sanctions, we talk about personal sanctions, about trade and sectoral economic sanctions, and we talk about financial sanctions, it has not to be interpreted as a threat.  We are not threatening anyone.  But we want to make clear which would be the consequences of some actions, because this is the deterrence part of the diplomatic talks.</p>
<p>I think it’s our duty to make clear which will be the consequences of aggression against Ukraine.  If it doesn’t happen, good, and we will do everything on the diplomatic side in order to avoid it.  But we have to be prepared to answer, and from the European Union, we have a certain number of tools on the economic side, trade and financial side that could be mobilized and certainly will be very damaging for the Russian economy.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Thank you, Mr. Secretary and Mr. High Representative.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks, folks.  Have a good afternoon.</p>

<p>Repeatedly over the last years, Ukraine has sought to move forward with the implementation of Minsk.  The Normandy Format, as it’s called with France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia involved has been the principal vehicle for trying to advance that.  I think if you look back over the requirements established in the Minsk Agreements, three agreements over the course of several months, it is a fair assessment to say that Ukraine has sought to move forward on most if not all of them, while Russia has made good on virtually none of its obligations under Minsk.</p>
<p>But in all of my conversations with our Ukrainian counterparts, they remain committed to it.  There was recently a meeting of senior officials in the Normandy Format.  Ukraine continues to put forward good-faith ideas on how to move forward.  Minsk does not spell out some issues of sequencing when it comes to the steps that the parties need to take.  Ukraine has been approaching this in good faith.  We have not to date seen Russia do the same.</p>
<p>The agreements speak of special status for the Donbas, and I believe that with the appropriate sequencing, the Ukrainians would be prepared to move forward.  But again, the overall picture on Minsk since 2014 has been one in which Ukraine has sought to move forward on most of its requirements and commitments; Russia has not.  So if Russia is serious about implementing Minsk, I think it will find a strong partner in Ukraine, and France and Germany are helping to lead this effort.  There&#8217;s supposed to be another meeting of the – in the Normandy Format in the next couple of weeks.  I hope Russia will demonstrate a seriousness of purpose.  There are some near-term steps that could be taken to continue to build confidence in – toward the implementation of Minsk.  We have one of them that&#8217;s already more or less in place, which is a ceasefire that brings things back to the levels of 2020.  It hasn&#8217;t been perfect, but it&#8217;s definitely been an improvement over what we were seeing just a few weeks ago, so that&#8217;s encouraging.</p>
<p>The Ukrainians have also talked about having a release of prisoners on both sides, and making sure as well that across the line of contact people can move much more freely.  Unfortunately, that&#8217;s been blocked by those on the separatist side.  I think that would be a good way to show seriousness of purpose, and then to pursue the actual implementation of the accords.  But bottom line is Ukraine is committed to Minsk.  If Russia is too, then I believe there&#8217;s a way to move forward and resolve this conflict.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Some in Ukraine are saying that the level of autonomy would be disruptive to your country.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>This is all for discussion and in progress.  Again, the Minsk Agreements talk about special status, but there are myriad other requirements that go to security, that go to restoring Ukraine&#8217;s border, that go to steps that unfortunately continue to be taken primarily by the Russian and separatist side that need to be addressed.  And I believe that those are addressed and addressed pursuant to what was agreed in 2014.  There&#8217;s a way to resolve this through the Minsk Agreements.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:  </strong>Thank you for your question.  We share a strong concern about the risk that are accumulating in the Ukrainian-Russian border.  And certainly, we are living, to my understanding, the most dangerous moment for the security in Europe after the end of the Cold War.  But at the same time, we believe that there is still room for diplomacy, there is still room for discussing, for knowing which are the concerns of everybody, also the Russian concerns, in order to avoid the worst.  Be prepared for the worst, and try to avoid it.</p>
<p>Nobody masses 104,000 soldiers heavily armed in the border of a country at the same time that you state about independency of this country in a way that certainly represents a strong threat –140,000 troops massed in the border is not to go to have tea.  So we have to increase our efforts in order to avoid a big risk for the peace and security.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>(Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:  </strong>I haven&#8217;t finished yet.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:  </strong>Minister Lavrov has sent a letter to all members of the European Union, to the member states, about it, asking for taking into consideration the security concerns of Russia.  I am coordinating the answer to this letter, and I insisting on the fact that there is still room for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Do you think that telegraphing the alarm about a potential invasion works against diplomatic efforts, the success of diplomatic efforts?</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:  </strong>With the mask, it is difficult to understand you.  Can &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Do you think that telegraphing the alarm so much about the potential of an invasion works against chances for a diplomatic solution?</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:  </strong>On one hand you have to warn about the situation, and on the other hand you have to work in order to solve the situation.  Both things go together.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Our next question will come from <em>El Pais</em>.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Thank you so much.  I have a question for High Representative Borrell and I – and also for Secretary Blinken.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:</strong>  Speak louder, because with the mask it’s difficult to understand.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary, for – question for High Representative Borrell and also Secretary Blinken.  It’s pretty much a follow-up question, actually.  The U.S. administration have been – has been sharing to the public several pieces of intelligence information or at least conclusions, and also specific sanctions regarding Russia&#8217;s intentions, and even how imminent an attack would be.  Do you think this can create alarmism, and do you think this is the smart strategy?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you.  First, let me say I’ve been reading <em>El Pais</em> very attentively, especially in recent days.  This is not alarmism; this is simply the facts.  We have to deal with the facts.  We have to deal with the facts in the context of history and we have to deal with the facts in making sure that we are fully prepared, and the facts are, as Josep said, that we have seen over the last few months a massing of Russian forces on Ukraine’s borders.  That’s not happening in a vacuum.  It’s happening in the context of what Russia already did in 2014 in invading Ukraine, seizing Crimea, creating a conflict in the Donbas that continues to this day.</p>
<p>So that’s what we’re seeing.  That’s what we’re looking at.  That’s what we’re responding to.  And we’ve made very clear as well that there are two paths before Russia.  One path is the path of diplomacy and dialogue that we have been pursuing together and in an effort to strengthen collective security for everyone.  We have deep concerns in the United States and Europe about many actions that Russia has taken over the years that undermine security.  Russia says it has concerns about us.  We have demonstrated that we’re fully prepared to address those concerns on a reciprocal basis and doing that in full and very close coordination.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, given the facts that we’re seeing, given the history that we know, we have to be prepared for what could happen.  We – we don’t believe that Mr. – President Putin has made a decision, but he has put in place the capacity should he so decide to act very quickly against Ukraine, and in ways that would have terrible consequences for Ukraine, for Russia, but consequences also for all of us, because these actions – this aggression, this threatened aggression against Ukraine – would undermine the core principles that were hard established after World War II and after the Cold War that have helped to protect security, stability, peace, and prosperity in Europe and beyond ever since, principles like one country can’t simply go in by force and change the borders of another.  One country can’t simply dictate to another its choices, its decisions, including about with whom it will associate.  One country cannot exert a sphere of influence over its neighbors to try to subjugate those neighbors to its will.</p>
<p>All of those things are at stake, and that’s why it’s been so important not just in terms of Ukraine, as important as that is, but in terms of the larger principles that are endangered by Russia’s conduct.  As Josep said, we strongly believe together in the United States and Europe that the preferred course – the responsible course – is to work through the differences that we have diplomatically and through dialogue, and we’ve demonstrated our commitment to do that.  But equally, we are prepared if Russia chooses the path of aggression.</p>
<p>We’ve worked incredibly closely together in the last months, as I mentioned, nearly 200 engagements among us that continue every single day, and I think it demonstrates a solidarity of purpose, a commitment to engage together on this either way that Russia chooses.  I have to say as well that here in the United States we’ve had very strong bipartisan support for Ukraine, for upholding these principles, for working together.  I spent time with Congress last week, and that was abundantly clear from Republican and Democratic members alike.  So we will see what President Putin decides, but either way, he is going to find a Europe and United States that are fully aligned, fully coordinating, fully cooperative.</p>
<p>Last point I’d just make:  You mentioned at the very beginning the disinformation campaign that we see Russia engaged in.  We believe – and it’s why we’ve spoken about it repeatedly – that the best antidote to disinformation is information, and that’s what we’ve sought to provide to the best of our ability.  We know that part of Russia’s playbook is to create false provocations as justification for acts that Russia was preparing to commit in any event, and so we’ve sought to put light on those, hopefully to deter them from happening, but at the very least so that if they do happen, no one is surprised and no one misinterprets what’s actually going on.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:</strong>  Well, at the beginning of the crisis, you remember, Tony, we had the phone call, and that’s when I said nothing should be agreed about European security without Europeans.  And I am very happy to say that since then we have been working very closely, I think more than ever.  This crisis has been pushing the transatlantic unity, and I am strongly satisfied of the participation of European Union on the (inaudible), the exchanges of positions among the U.S., the NATO, and Russia.</p>
<p>European Union is not a military association.  It’s not a military organization or union.  But we have a lot of strength on the civilian side.  And when we talk about sanctions, we talk about personal sanctions, about trade and sectoral economic sanctions, and we talk about financial sanctions, it has not to be interpreted as a threat.  We are not threatening anyone.  But we want to make clear which would be the consequences of some actions, because this is the deterrence part of the diplomatic talks.</p>
<p>I think it’s our duty to make clear which will be the consequences of aggression against Ukraine.  If it doesn’t happen, good, and we will do everything on the diplomatic side in order to avoid it.  But we have to be prepared to answer, and from the European Union, we have a certain number of tools on the economic side, trade and financial side that could be mobilized and certainly will be very damaging for the Russian economy.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Thank you, Mr. Secretary and Mr. High Representative.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks, folks.  Have a good afternoon.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The text of the following statement was released by the Government of the United States of America and the European Union on the occasion of the ninth meeting of the U.S.-EU Energy Council.</p>
<p><em>Begin Text:</em></p>
<p>The ninth United States &#8211; European Union Energy Council (“Council”) met today in Washington, D.C., chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm, EU High Representative/Vice President Josep Borrell Fontelles, and European Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson. The Ambassador of France to the United States Philippe Etienne represented the Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU). As reconfirmed in the June 15, 2021 EU-U.S. Summit Statement, the U.S.-EU Energy Council is the lead transatlantic coordination forum on strategic energy issues. The Council built on the work announced by President von der Leyen and President Biden on U.S.-EU cooperation on energy security in their Joint Statement of 28 January 2022.</p>
<p>Mindful of the rapidly changing energy landscape and the continued risks to energy security, including cybersecurity of energy infrastructure, the U.S.-EU Energy Council works to enhance energy security and promote energy diversification. The parties emphasized that accelerating the just energy transition to a net-zero future will support the mitigation of energy market fluctuations and facilitate access to affordable and reliable energy. The Council discussed the urgency for action to address the gas supply situation in Europe and to ensure gas supply to Ukraine.</p>
<p>The United States and the EU each underlined their commitment to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and to working together to ensure a rapid decarbonization and clean energy transition, and to promote increasing investments in related technologies. Accordingly, the Council reiterated the need to phase out unabated coal for power generation and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies without delay. The Council also works to accelerate a just energy transition to climate neutrality for citizens of the EU, the United States, and around the globe, and to promote research and development, innovation and deployment in related fields.</p>
<p><strong>Bolstering Energy Security in the EU and its neighborhood, including in Ukraine and the Western Balkans</strong></p>
<p>The Council reaffirmed the importance of the United States and EU working together on our mutual net-zero energy transition as countries increase their climate ambitions to ensure that consumers have secure access to affordable and reliable energy. The EU and the United States affirmed their commitment to proactively cooperate to address any potential risks related to energy supply in the EU and its neighborhood. This cooperation endeavors to focus on avoiding energy and resource supply disruptions and improving diversification of energy suppliers, fuel types in line with our net-zero targets, and means of transport. The Council underlined that competitive and transparent global energy markets remain critical to ensuring a reliable, affordable, and secure energy supply for Europe. As we address geopolitical and climate impacts on current energy markets, the EU and the United States intend to work together so that global liquefied natural gas markets have the capacity to provide additional and diversified supplies in case of pipeline gas disruptions in the short term as countries move away from fossil fuels and towards a sustainable net-zero future. The EU and the United States also recognize the growing cyber related threats to energy infrastructure and plan to continue related cooperation including in the context of the synchronization of the Baltic States’ electricity networks with the Continental European Network.</p>
<p>The Council reiterated that it is unacceptable to use energy supply as a weapon or geopolitical lever. This conviction underpinned the Council&#8217;s support for enhancing the resilience and energy security of Eastern partners, such as the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, including through reverse gas flows. Recognizing current geopolitical tensions, the United States and the EU discussed intensifying cooperation in the short-term to ensure sufficient energy supplies for the EU and its neighborhood.</p>
<p>The Council affirmed that Ukraine continues to be a key partner of both the EU and the United States and expressed firm support for a strong and resilient Ukraine. It emphasized that energy security is vital to a sovereign Ukraine. The Council reiterated that Ukraine is a strategic gas transit country for the EU and should continue to promote the integration of Ukraine into the EU’s energy market, with the goal of improving Ukraine’s energy security, accelerating its decarbonization and clean energy transition, and enhancing its potential for clean energy exports. The Council expressed continued support for exploring new gas transit routes and capacity from the EU to Ukraine. The Council emphasized the importance of continuing to support the synchronization process of the electricity networks of Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova with the Continental European Network. The Council dedicated itself to new efforts to invest in and support Ukraine’s decarbonization efforts and relevant infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Council reaffirmed the need for transparent, robust, and independent institutions in Ukraine&#8217;s energy sector, in particular the energy market regulatory authorities and financial markets authorities, including the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine. It highlighted that strong corporate governance and supervisory board autonomy without political interference are fundamental components to national energy security. As we are moving towards Ukraine’s integration with the European energy market, we will aim at strengthening corporate governance and supervisory board autonomy in Ukraine. The Council also emphasized its support for speedy energy sector reforms.</p>
<p>The Council reaffirmed the importance of advancing transparent, integrated, and competitive energy markets in the Western Balkans, and associated market and regulatory reforms, in line with the EU enlargement policy and obligations under the Energy Community Treaty. The</p>
<p>Council confirmed the importance of the decarbonization of the Western Balkans and integration of their electricity markets with the EU neighboring electricity market. The Council should continue coordination on energy market and regulatory reforms and support for decarbonization in the Western Balkans, in particular to phase out unabated coal for power generation and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. The Council also underlined the need to ensure the security of energy supply, notably through access to alternative supply sources. The Council welcomed the adoption of the Clean Energy Package and Decarbonisation Roadmap by the Energy Community, encouraged their speedy implementation, and acknowledged the importance of supporting the development of the region’s potential participation in renewable energy supply chains. The Council also emphasized the importance of close U.S.-EU coordination to foster regional cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Policy, Technology, and Innovation for a Clean and Just Energy Transition</strong></p>
<p>The Council underlined the importance of energy cooperation in research and innovation that supports global efforts towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 by offering policy and technological solutions that are aligned with the climate objectives of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The EU and the United States share objectives to reduce methane emissions from all fossil fuels and along the entire supply chain. In this respect, the Council acknowledged successful EU-U.S. leadership in launching the Global Methane Pledge at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) of the UN Climate Change Conference. The Council intends to initiate work on a common tool for life cycle analysis (LCA) of methane emissions for hydrocarbon suppliers that will advance global efforts to move towards consistency and accuracy of the measurement, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas emissions from the production of hydrocarbons and support improved reporting on methane in national greenhouse gas inventories. The International Methane Emissions Observatory will act as a key data collector and a validator to enhance methane measurement in alignment with the OGMP 2.0 standard. The EU and the United States plan to cooperate in the development of more uniform international methane emissions testing methodologies by bringing together centers of expertise in metrology.</p>
<p>The Council acknowledged the role that clean and renewable hydrogen will play in decarbonizing our energy systems. To that end, the Council expressed support for leveraging the bilateral relationship through multilateral engagement to advance work on hydrogen of this type including on codes, standards and certification, and regulatory frameworks, research and technology innovation, setting the foundation for open and resilient global hydrogen markets. The EU and the United States intend to explore engagement with the private sector on this topic. The Council noted the importance of coordinating and streamlining the work of different international initiatives on hydrogen.</p>
<p>The Council recognized the 2021 joint U.S.-EU Energy Council Energy Efficiency in Buildings Webinar Series, which emphasized the need for further efforts such as Mission Innovation and the International Energy Agency’s Energy in Buildings and Communities Programme that address energy efficiency and carbon performance of the buildings and construction sector, both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>The United States and the EU consider that onshore and offshore wind power are key technologies for clean power generation. The Council announced planning for the third High-Level Business to Business Forum under the U.S.-EU Energy Council in 2022, which will focus on offshore wind, and looked forward to receiving a report on the event.</p>
<p>The Council emphasized that decarbonization efforts must be matched by adequate efforts to ensure a just and socially inclusive energy transition that leaves no one behind. To this end, a holistic approach is required to tackle energy poverty and support transitioning communities. Ahead, during, and after key international milestones, such as COP27, the EU and the United States are exchanging information on experiences regarding just transition and how to advance international cooperation. The Council noted that a roadmap with possible joint actions in 2022 should be prepared.</p>
<p><strong>Complementary Progress in Other Fora</strong></p>
<p>The Council acknowledged progress on multilateral and other bilateral initiatives and expressed its intent to discuss and coordinate positions ahead of major multilateral events. The strong EU-U.S. relationship has paved the way for more ambitious global climate and energy actions notably at COP26, G7, G20, International Energy Agency, Clean Energy Ministerial, Mission Innovation, the Partnership for Transatlantic Energy and Climate Cooperation (P-TECC), International Renewable Energy Agency, and in fusion through both the ITER international agreement and EURATOM research. The Council also welcomed the work of other U.S.-EU bilateral platforms, including the newly established Trade and Technology Council, which demonstrate both partners’ overall commitment to reaching net-zero emissions and increase access and availability of clean energy technologies. The United States and the EU plan to coordinate their efforts in support of third countries to promote relevant market and regulatory reforms to ensure robust decarbonization efforts, a swift, just and socially inclusive energy transition to a climate-neutral future, and to address energy poverty including in Africa. The Council reiterated the United States and EU’s commitment to provide trusted connections by promoting an infrastructure development globally that is high-standard, transparent, and climate resilient, through U.S., EU, regional, and multilateral initiatives including Build Back Better World and the Global Gateway.</p>
