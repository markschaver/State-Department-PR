<p>In Fiji on February 12, Secretary Blinken will meet with Pacific Island leaders to discuss the climate crisis, ending the COVID-19 pandemic, disaster assistance, and ways to further our shared commitment to democracy, regional solidarity, and prosperity in the Pacific.  The Secretary also will meet with Fiji Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe “Frank” Bainimarama to discuss deepening bilateral engagement and ways to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific.  This will be the first visit by a Secretary of State to Fiji since 1985.</p>
<p>In Honolulu, Hawaii on February 12, Secretary Blinken will host Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi and Republic of Korea Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong for a U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea Trilateral Ministerial Meeting to deepen our cooperation in addressing threats from the DPRK’s nuclear and missile programs and confronting 21st century challenges together across the globe.  Secretary Blinken also will meet with Foreign Minister Chung and, separately, with USINDOPACOM Commander Admiral John Aquilino.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The Department of State is imposing visa restrictions on Belarusian nationals under the “Khashoggi Ban,&#8221; a tool the Administration announced last year to counter transnational repression.  Today’s actions target multiple Belarusian nationals for their involvement in serious, extraterritorial counter-dissident activity.  The United States condemns all such activity, including the attempt to forcibly repatriate Belarusian Olympian Krystsina Tsimanouskaya during the Tokyo Summer Olympic Games last year.</p>
<p>The United States applauds the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation&#8217;s efforts to support and protect the human rights of athletes amid the Lukashenka regime’s violent crackdown and ongoing repression of Belarusians inside and outside the country.  We stand in solidarity with Ms. Tsimanouskaya and all others who have experienced the regime’s attempts to silence criticism.</p>
<p>This action is part of a comprehensive effort to prevent and respond to acts of transnational repression by any government targeting journalists, activists, and dissidents for abuse, bringing together diplomatic, law enforcement, and intelligence tools to deter repressive governments and protect targeted individuals and groups, including within the United States. The Khashoggi Ban, a global visa restriction policy pursuant to Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, is one important tool in this effort.</p>
<p>The United States reaffirms its support for the people of Belarus and once again calls on the Lukashenka regime to end its crackdown on members of civil society, independent media, the political opposition, athletes, students, legal professionals, and other Belarusians; to immediately release all political prisoners; to engage in sincere facilitated dialogue with the democratic opposition and civil society; to fulfill its international human rights obligations; to stop its coercion of vulnerable people and its retaliatory action against governments and groups that assist them; and to hold free and fair elections under international observation.  We will continue working with the international community to hold accountable those responsible for repression and human rights violations and abuses in Belarus.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The military operation authorized by President Biden and carried out by U.S. forces last night in northwest Syria has resulted in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, the leader of ISIS – a significant victory in the global fight to disrupt and dismantle ISIS.</p>
<p>This successful operation is a credit to our brave service members and national security professionals, who undertook this mission at President Biden’s direction after months of careful planning. Throughout that process, the United States took extraordinary care to protect innocent lives and prevent noncombatant casualties. ISIS, however, once again revealed its disregard for human life, including that of women and children, when al-Qurayshi choose to detonate a suicide bomb, killing his own family.</p>
<p>Al-Qurayshi, also known as Hajji Abdallah, took over ISIS in October 2019 after years of serving as a senior leader in the terrorist organization. He was known for his brutal enforcement of ISIS’s vicious ideology and was a driving force behind ISIS’s violent campaigns to subjugate communities and oppress perceived enemies, including the Yazidis, a religious minority in Iraq. He coordinated the group’s global terror operations during a period in which ISIS expanded its geographic presence and attacks in Africa.</p>
<p>This operation was part of a larger mission by the members of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS to deny ISIS’s territorial control in Iraq and Syria, counter ISIS’s messaging and financing, and stabilize areas that have been liberated from ISIS to prevent the group from resurging. Al-Qurayshi’s death strikes a significant blow against ISIS. Now the United States and our partners in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS will continue the effort. Our goal is the enduring defeat of ISIS and that fight continues.</p>

		<title>Designation of an Indonesia-Based Organization for Support to Terrorism</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is designating World Human Care, an Indonesia-based organization that has provided financial support to Majelis Mujahidin Indonesia (MMI), an Indonesia-based terrorist group.  World Human Care provides financial support for MMI activities in Syria under the pretense of providing humanitarian aid.  This sanctions action is taken under Executive Order 13224, as amended, which targets terrorists, leaders, and officials of terrorist groups, and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>MMI, formed in 2000, has conducted attacks in Indonesia.  It was designated by the Department of State on June 12, 2017, in connection with acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.  MMI has also been linked to the al-Qa’ida-linked Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham in Syria, another designated terrorist group.</p>
<p>The United States is taking this action to expose and disrupt MMI’s deceptive efforts to use a humanitarian organization as cover for raising and transferring illicit funds.  The vast majority of humanitarian aid providers are legitimate and often heroic organizations providing essential, life-saving humanitarian assistance in Syria and elsewhere.  Unfortunately, World Human Care’s actions are deplorable not only for their support for terrorist organizations but also because they undermine the work and reputation of genuine humanitarian aid providers worldwide.</p>
<p>We will continue to work with foreign partners to protect legitimate non-profit organizations from abuse by terrorist groups and expose terrorist financing under the guise of humanitarian aid. For more information on today’s action, please see the Department of the Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0585" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

<p>The United States is taking this action to expose and disrupt MMI’s deceptive efforts to use a humanitarian organization as cover for raising and transferring illicit funds.  The vast majority of humanitarian aid providers are legitimate and often heroic organizations providing essential, life-saving humanitarian assistance in Syria and elsewhere.  Unfortunately, World Human Care’s actions are deplorable not only for their support for terrorist organizations but also because they undermine the work and reputation of genuine humanitarian aid providers worldwide.</p>
<p>We will continue to work with foreign partners to protect legitimate non-profit organizations from abuse by terrorist groups and expose terrorist financing under the guise of humanitarian aid. For more information on today’s action, please see the Department of the Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0585" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>We are concerned by the breach, announced last month, of sensitive data held by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  For 150 years, the ICRC and the wider Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement have played a unique and essential role in protecting vulnerable populations from the harms of armed conflicts, natural disasters, and other emergencies.</p>
<p>To fulfill that role, the ICRC often does what no one else can — accessing detained persons in conflict zones or crossing frontlines to reach those in need.  Its independence and impartiality have long allowed it to have access to confidential information and data, including data on conflict victims and other victims of armed violence, the forcibly displaced, missing persons, and other vulnerable populations.  The information it acquires and uses is critical to fulfilling its functions to provide medical services and humanitarian protection and assistance — functions that all states have pledged to support in instruments such as the Geneva Conventions.</p>
<p>Targeting the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement’s sensitive and confidential data is a dangerous development.  It has real consequences: this cyber incident has harmed the global humanitarian network’s ability to locate missing people and reconnect families.  This is why it is so vital that humanitarian data be respected and only used for intended purposes.</p>
<p>To ensure states and vulnerable people can continue to trust and rely on the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement for the help they need, states should join the ICRC in raising the alarm about this breach.</p>
