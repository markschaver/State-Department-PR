					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p>The Hotel</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Well, good afternoon, everyone.  I’ll just say very quickly what a pleasure it is to see my friend and colleague Marise Payne.  We’ve spent a fair bit of time together in various parts of the world &#8212;</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER PAYNE:</b>  We’re here.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  &#8212; but it’s very good to see you here in Brussels.  We’re excited at the prospect of bringing some of our partners from the Asia Pacific together with NATO – that’s certainly part of what we’re doing here together – but also a lot of work that we’re following up on that we’ve been doing together in the region through AUKUS, and many other initiatives that we’re engaged in, and of course, the situation resulting from Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.</p>
<p>So, lots to catch up on.  Great to see you.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER PAYNE:  </b>Indeed.  Great to be here too, Tony, with our team.  We’ve just arrived, as you noted, but importantly, at this critical time, a critical time for partners like Australia and the United States to be closely joined in response to the actions of authoritarian states that are untenable, unacceptable, complete illegal violations, wholesale violations of international law and the UN Charter.  So coming here this week is extremely important for Australia to join with the United States and our partners in that response to make sure that we are working in as coordinated and comprehensive a way as possible.</p>
<p>So I’m looking forward to those discussions, and also to reinforcing the importance that no matter where in the world they behave like this, authoritarian states cannot be allowed to trample on the rights of democratic countries and on the people who have chosen to live and work in those democracies.  So it is a very important engagement.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>In a display of the strengthening ties between the United States and Italy, the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), the U.S. Mission in Italy, and other U.S. and local officials celebrated the groundbreaking of the new U.S. Consulate General in Milan on April 6.</p>
<p>The new U.S. Consulate General campus, which includes the restored iconic Liberty Building, Liberty Plaza, and Parade Ground, will offer a modern public gathering space and gateway welcoming visitors and staff.</p>
<p>SHoP Architects of New York is the design architect and Caddell Construction Company, LLC of Montgomery, Alabama, is the construction contractor.  An estimated $65 million will be directly invested in the local economy and approximately 450 workers will be employed at the peak of construction activities.  The new U.S. Consulate General is scheduled for completion in 2025 and will provide an ecologically resilient platform for diplomacy in northern Italy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The world has been shocked and appalled by the atrocities committed by Russia’s forces in Bucha and across Ukraine.  Ukraine’s forces bravely continue to defend their country and their freedom, and the United States, along with our Allies and partners, stand steadfast in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation from the President earlier today, the immediate drawdown of security assistance valued at up to $100 million to meet Ukraine’s urgent need for additional anti-armor systems.  This authorization is the sixth drawdown of arms, equipment, and supplies from Department of Defense inventories for Ukraine since August 2021.  Combined with $300 million in assistance announced by the Department of Defense on April 1 under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, this additional drawdown brings the total U.S. security assistance commitment to Ukraine to more than $2.4 billion since the beginning of this Administration, and more than $1.7 billion* *since the beginning of Russia’s brutal assault against Ukraine began on February 24.</p>
<p>In addition to what we have provided, more than 30 countries have joined us to deliver security assistance to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began. Together, we are delivering security assistance every day, and we are expediting shipments of even more of the arms and defense equipment Ukraine is using to defend itself.  As we strengthen Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and at the negotiating table, we will also work with our Allies and partners to gather information to document reported abuses and make it available to the appropriate bodies to hold those responsible to account.</p>
<p>United with our Allies and partners, we will continue to provide security assistance in support of Ukraine’s defense, as well as economic support, and humanitarian aid for communities devastated by Russia’s ruthless brutality.</p>

<p>On April 5 Special Representative for the DPRK Sung Kim met with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Affairs Liu Xiaoming in Washington, D.C., to discuss recent developments in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).</p>
<p>Special Representative Kim condemned the DPRK’s March 24 ICBM launch, the latest in a series of increasingly escalatory actions by the DPRK. He noted that each of the DPRK’s 13 ballistic missile launches this year constituted clear violations of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and posed a serious threat to regional stability, and reiterated the importance of responding firmly to these escalatory actions. Special Representative Kim reaffirmed that the United States is committed to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy with the DPRK. Special Representative Kim and Special Representative Liu discussed opportunities to advance our shared goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and how to encourage the DPRK to engage in meaningful negotiations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Following a coordinated German law enforcement action, the United States today took further action to combat Russian-related illicit finance and cybercrime by sanctioning the world’s largest darknet market for Russian speakers, Hydra, and the virtual currency exchange Garantex.</p>
<p>Today’s action – coordinated with our allies and partners – disrupts ransomware infrastructure and actors and targets the abuse of virtual currency to launder ransom payments.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Hydra, which provides a marketplace for illicit services, including ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) and hacking services and software, stolen personal information, counterfeit currency, stolen virtual currency, and illicit drugs. The U.S. Department of Treasury also designated Garantex, a virtual currency exchange that has processed millions of dollars in transactions associated with illicit actors, including nearly $6 million from Russian ransomware gang Conti and more than $2 million from Hydra.</p>
<p>The United States is committed to taking action against those who engage in money laundering or the financing of terrorism and allow their systems to be abused for illicit purposes. Wanton disregard for regulations and compliance by persons that run virtual currency exchanges will be investigated and, if appropriate, those responsible will be held accountable for their actions. The United States urges the international community to effectively implement international Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) standards with respect to virtual asset, particularly regarding virtual assets service providers.</p>
<p>For more information on today’s action, please see Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0701" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Joint Base Andrews</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good morning, everyone.  As this Russian tide is receding from parts of Ukraine, the world is seeing the death and destruction left in its wake, and we’re seeing in particular the horror that’s been left behind in Bucha, something that is touching people literally around the world.</p>
<p>What we’ve seen in Bucha is not the random act of a rogue unit.  It’s a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities.  The reports are more than credible.  The evidence is there for the world to see.  This reinforces our determination and the determination of countries around the world to make sure that one way or another, one day or another, there is accountability for those who committed these acts, for those who ordered them.  There’s also a strong determination to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to continue to support Ukraine in its brave fight to push the Russian aggression out of Ukraine, and of course, to sustain and increase the pressure on Russia to stop this aggression.</p>
<p>We’re heading off to Brussels now for a meeting of the NATO foreign ministers, for a meeting of the G7 foreign ministers, the leading democratic economies in the world, all of which will go to supporting the efforts that – accountability and support for Ukraine, increase pressure on Russia.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Mr. Secretary &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Mr. Secretary, when you talk about basically a deliberate campaign to kill civilians, does the U.S. have evidence linking senior Russian officials in Moscow to either ordering or knowledge of the acts being committed?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  We’re working, as are others, to put the evidence together to support the efforts of the Ukrainian prosecutor general, to support the efforts of the UN Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry that we helped establish, marshaling all of this, putting all of this together.</p>
<p>We said before the aggression that we anticipated that if it went forward, there would be atrocities committed.  Information that we’ve seen going into the aggression suggested that this would be part of the Russian campaign.  Horrifically, tragically, what we’re seeing in Bucha and in other places supports that.  But in all of these instances, there’s a very important effort to put the evidence together, to compile it, to document it, to support the different investigations that are going on.  That’s what we’re doing.  That’s what others are doing.  This will play out over time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what’s vital is to sustain and build on the support for Ukraine, to sustain and build on the pressure against Russia to bring this war to an end, to stop the death and destruction that Russia’s perpetrating in Ukraine.  Thank you.</p>
