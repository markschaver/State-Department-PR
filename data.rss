					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>While Palestinians in Gaza face harsh living and economic conditions under Hamas, the terrorist group has amassed hundreds of millions in its secret investment portfolio.  Hamas maintains a violent agenda that harms both Israelis and Palestinians.  The United States is committed to denying Hamas the ability to generate and move funds and to holding it to account for its role in promoting and carrying out violence.  Today, the United States is designating an expansive network of three Hamas financial facilitators and six companies across the Middle East and North Africa that generated revenue for the terrorist group through the management of an international investment portfolio.  The United States is also designating a senior Hamas finance official.</p>
<p>These individuals and companies are being designated under Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended, which targets terrorists, leaders, and officials of terrorist groups, and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism.  The United States designated Hamas as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in October 1997, and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist pursuant to E.O. 13224 in October 2001.</p>
<p>Today’s action targets the individuals and companies that Hamas uses to conceal and launder its funds.  For more information on this action, please see the Department of the Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0798" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Labor today issued a business advisory on Sudan, highlighting the growing reputational risks to U.S. businesses and individuals associated with conducting business with Sudanese State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) and military-controlled companies.</p>
<p>These risks arise from, among other things, recent actions undertaken by Sudan’s Sovereign Council and security forces under the military’s command, including and especially serious human rights abuse against protesters. While certain risks predate the country’s October 2021 military takeover, the takeover and the military’s actions since then have exacerbated them and could adversely impact U.S. businesses and individuals and their operations in Sudan.</p>
<p>Businesses and individuals operating in Sudan should undertake increased due diligence related to human rights issues and be aware of the potential reputational risks of conducting business activities and/or transactions with SOEs and military-controlled companies. U.S. businesses and individuals should also take care to avoid interaction with any persons listed on the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls’(OFAC) list of <a class="external-link" href="https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">Specially Designated Nationals</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a> and Blocked Persons (SDN List).</p>
<p>The United States remains committed to supporting the Sudanese peoples’ aspiration for a civilian-led transition to an elected government. We continue to support the Sudanese-led, UN-AU-IGAD facilitated dialogue around the transition process.</p>
<p>Read the full business advisory here: <a href="https://www.state.gov/risks-and-considerations-for-u-s-businesses-operating-in-sudan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA1MjMuNTgzMzQxMjEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZS5nb3Yvcmlza3MtYW5kLWNvbnNpZGVyYXRpb25zLWZvci11LXMtYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy1vcGVyYXRpbmctaW4tc3VkYW4vIn0.gJDB8YDxMUgeIDjkZ-kgtOXPVlGhW_tLshljr_yHMjU/s/2171565732/br/131765420033-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1653418961601000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1FVoZSgCWw383WuGjszriK">https://www.state.gov/risks-<wbr />and-considerations-for-u-s-<wbr />businesses-operating-in-sudan/</a><wbr />.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p>Happoen</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:  </strong>Tony, I am delighted to welcome you in Tokyo.  And amid the lovely evolving strategic environment surrounding us, it is significant that we are able to hold a Quad leaders’ meeting tomorrow here in Tokyo supporting our ministerial meeting in February.  And notwithstanding ongoing Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, after today is a summit meeting with Japan and the U.S., who are able to, number one, share the strategic importance of Indo-Pacific region, and number two, renew our commitment to peace and prosperity of the region.</p>
<p>So keeping in mind the discussion had between the two leaders, I look forward to have a candid discussion with you on an agenda such as regional issues and measures to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance.  So over to you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Yogi, thank you.  It’s wonderful, as always, to be with you, especially to be here in Tokyo.  Our two leaders had, I think, a very, very substantive and extremely productive discussion that went on for some time covering a broad range of issues, which I think is further evidence of the fact that our alliance between Japan and the United States is stronger than it’s ever been, and more important in many ways than it’s ever been.  We’re working together bilaterally; we’re working together regionally; we’re working together globally.</p>
<p>And I think that’s brought home again with the events of today and tomorrow where you’re hosting the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, and tomorrow, another leaders’ meeting of the Quad.  We are grateful for this partnership.  At challenging times like these, having such close partners and friends as Japan is particularly meaningful.  So it’s great to be with you, great to be with you here in Tokyo, and I look forward to a good conversation.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:  </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you.</p>
