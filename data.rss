					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It’s a pleasure to have the Foreign Minister of Yemen here with us today, someone very familiar to Washington, to the United States, having been ambassador here before.  But it’s wonderful to welcome you to the State Department – welcome back to the State Department – especially in this moment, because this is a moment of genuine and important opportunity for Yemen and its people: after so many years of war, conflict, and suffering, an opportunity for peace that we hope all Yemenis will find a way to seize.</p>
<p>We very much welcome the government’s support for the truce, for the resumption now of commercial flights from Sana’a – first one yesterday to Amman; more to follow – and as well, the focus now of the Presidential Leadership Council on doing everything possible to support the needs of the Yemeni people despite the great challenges.  We – United States strongly supports all of these efforts.  We are with you in trying to move things forward and to take advantage of this moment.</p>
<p>So I think it’s a very good time for us to be able to share some thoughts on where we are, where we go, and to again, as I say, take advantage of the fact that after so many years there is an opening for a more durable peace, something that the United States will be a partner in and do what is necessary to help make it real.  Mr. Minister, welcome.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MUBARAK:</strong>  Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary.  I’m very glad to be here again, specifically in this building.  I told the Politico that I miss this building.  We had a lot of meetings and receptions here.  I would like to thank you so much, thank the U.S. administration for placing Yemen as a priority, for appointing an excellent envoy who he did a great job on supporting us in many aspects.  I mean, we celebrated yesterday the first flight from – from Sana’a to Amman, and that was fruits of our joint work.</p>
<p>I thank also the level of – and we appreciate very much the level of support that we’re getting from the U.S. administration for the PLC, the Presidential Leadership Council.  You know our position.  We were always seeking for peace.  We did a lot of – so many concessions to make peace.  We respected the truce and we are very hopeful to extend this truce and start – we are ready for a new initiative.  We are ready for peace.  The question is are Houthis ready for that.</p>
<p>You just mentioned the flight.  Taiz is still under siege.  Taiz is still – even the meeting about Taiz is not conducted because Houthis, they do not – they didn’t nominate their names, so we are expecting more pressure from international community, specifically from the U.S. administration.  We want to see lift the siege.  People of Taiz, they cannot wait more.</p>
<p>There is a window of peace.  There is a moment in that we all – we are all have to seize.  Be sure that you have a partner in Yemen, not just in peace process, but also in CT.  We missed you in Marrakech.  We were there, but also maintaining and ensuring the security of the (inaudible), the (inaudible) which is (inaudible).</p>
<p>I’m very keen to discuss all these issues with you in this meeting, including (inaudible) and the other vital and critical issues.  Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks.  Thanks, everyone.</p>

<p>The below is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken met today with Yemeni Foreign Minister Ahmed bin Mubarak and reiterated the United States’ commitment to support the end of the conflict in Yemen, and a stable, safe, and prosperous future for Yemenis. The Secretary thanked the Foreign Minister for his efforts and those of his government in facilitating the first commercial flight from Sana’a since 2016 on May 16. The Government of Yemen’s agreement to allow these flights to proceed to Amman brings much needed relief to the Yemeni people. Secretary Blinken discussed U.S. support for securing and building on the UN-negotiated truce to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire and an inclusive political process that empowers Yemenis to determine their own future. The Secretary specifically noted the importance of ensuring the freedom of movement of people and goods through contested areas, like the city of Taiz, Yemen’s third largest city, where hundreds of thousands of Yemenis are suffering under siege-like conditions and bearing the brunt of the humanitarian crisis. Secretary Blinken expressed U.S. support for the Presidential Leadership Council and called it a valuable opportunity for broader representation of Yemenis. He noted with appreciation the Council’s expressed commitment to peace efforts and to improving basic services and economic stability for millions of Yemenis.</p>

<p>Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration Julieta Valls Noyes will travel to New York, New York, May 18-20, where she will attend the International Migration Review Forum (IMRF) to discuss international cooperation on migration and meet with UN and government officials.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin Room</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It’s a great pleasure to have my friend, the Greek foreign minister, here at the State Department.  This has been an important and incredibly productive couple of days, notably with the prime minister’s visit, his meeting with President Biden yesterday, the prime minister’s appearance before Congress today.  And it’s upon us now – Nikos and myself – to follow up on all the instructions we’re getting from President Biden and Prime Minister Mitsotakis to continue to do the work that has brought partnership between the United States and Greece – at least in my judgment – to its highest point ever.</p>
<p>We are grateful for that partnership: the work that we are doing together to stand against Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, and to stand with Ukraine; and the work that we’re doing together to strengthen and diversify energy security, including in the Eastern Mediterranean; the work we’re doing together through the Strategic Dialogue that we conducted and that we’re going to continue across so many different areas in the relationship between Greece and the United States.</p>
<p>So I’m grateful to have this opportunity with Nikos to follow up on the meeting between the President and the prime minister, to continue the important work we’re doing together to build the strongest possible relationship between Greece and the United States.</p>
<p>Nikos.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER DENDIAS:</b>  Thank you.  It’s a great opportunity to be here today after a spectacular meeting with President Biden yesterday, and, if you allow me to say, a historic speech of my prime minister &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Yes.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER DENDIAS:  </b>&#8212; Prime Minister Mitsotakis – to Congress today.  I’m looking forward to discussing Ukraine.  After the Russian invasion, I think it’s good to compare notes and see where we’re going from here.  Also, I will brief you on the situation in the southeast Mediterranean, and see how the United States could be more present in the region – the 3+1 model, for example.  It’s something that is of huge importance for us, and I would like to discuss how we can enhance it, and also discuss challenges to a rules-based international order all around.</p>
<p>I have to say it is important for us that the United States understands that no ground should be left to revisionist power who try to change this rules-based international order.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER DENDIAS:</b>  Thank you so much for the opportunity, and I’ll say it’s great to see you well again after the COVID.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you, my friend.  Appreciate it.  Come on in.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State is announcing the launch of a new Conflict Observatory to capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.  The program encompasses the documentation, verification, and dissemination of open-source evidence regarding the actions of Russia’s forces during President Putin’s brutal war of choice.  The Conflict Observatory will analyze and preserve publicly and commercially available information, including satellite imagery and information shared via social media, consistent with international legal standards, for use in ongoing and future accountability mechanisms.  This includes maintaining rigorous chain-of-custody procedures for future civil and criminal legal processes under appropriate jurisdictions.  An online platform will publicly share the Conflict Observatory’s documentation to help refute Russia’s disinformation efforts and shine a light on abuses.</p>
<p>This program is being established with an initial $6 million investment, with future funding to come from the European Democratic Resilience Initiative (EDRI).  In March, the White House announced at least $320 million in funds for EDRI to bolster democratic resilience, advance anti-corruption efforts, and promote respect for human rights in Ukraine and its region.  This new Conflict Observatory program is part of a range of U.S. government efforts at both national and international levels designed to ensure future accountability for Russia’s horrific actions.</p>
<p>The Conflict Observatory is a collaborative endeavor with Esri, a leading geographic information systems company, Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab, the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative, and PlanetScape Ai.  The U.S. government has also contributed commercial satellite imagery to these efforts.  We expect other international partner organizations to join as the program proceeds.  Reports and analyses will be available online through the ConflictObservatory.org website.</p>
<p>The Conflict Observatory is a further demonstration of the United States’ steadfast support for the people of Ukraine as they valiantly defend their country and their freedom in response to President Putin’s premeditated, unjustified, and unprovoked war.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States affirms today, on the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia, and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT), that the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons are the same human rights to which all persons are entitled. As enshrined in Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, “ll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”</p>
<p>Too many LGBTQI+ persons live under the shadow of discrimination, violence, and fear. Global data makes clear that the dehumanization of LGBTQI+ persons is systemic, pervasive, and often violent.  Homophobia, biphobia, interphobia, and transphobia are deeply entrenched in societies across the world, including here in the United States.  Countless persons are at extreme risk for being themselves.</p>
<p>We remain committed to ending this intolerance. Everyone deserves to live with respect, dignity, and safety.  The United States affirms that all LGBTQI+ individuals, couples, and their families are valid and valuable.  In line with commitments made at President Biden’s Summit for Democracy and resulting Year of Action, we will continue to support reforms to yield a world free from discrimination and violence, so that all of our LGBTQI+ friends, colleagues, neighbors, and family may live freely with dignity and equal respect for their human rights.</p>
