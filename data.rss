					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>I am announcing the designation of five terrorist leaders in Africa. Bonomade Machude Omar, Sidan ag Hitta, Salem ould Breihmatt, Ali Mohamed Rage, and Abdikadir Mohamed Abdikadir are designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) under Executive Order 13224, as amended.</p>
<ul>
<li>BonomadeMachudeOmar, also known as Abu Sulayfa Muhammad and Ibn Omar, leads the Military and External Affairs Departments for ISIS-Mozambique and serves as the senior commander and lead coordinator for all attacks conducted by the group in northern Mozambique, as well as the lead facilitator and communications conduit for the group.  During the March 2021 attack on Palma, Omar led one group of fighters while Abu Yasir Hassan, the leader of ISIS-Mozambique, led another group of fighters, and Omar also led the attack on the Amarula Hotel in Palma.  Omar has been responsible for attacks in Cabo Delgado Province, Mozambique, and Mtwara Region, Tanzania.</li>
<li>Sidanag Hitta, also known as Abu Qarwaniand Abu Abdelhakim al-Kidali, is a senior leader and commander responsible for the Kidal Region in Mali within Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM). Hitta was among the group responsible for the January 20, 2019, attack on the MINUSMA base in Aguelhoc, Kidal Region, Mali.  He was also responsible for hostages in the Kidal Region.</li>
<li>Salem ouldBreihmatt, also known as Abu Hamza al-Shanqitiand Hamza al-Mauritani, is a JNIM senior leader and emir of Arbinda and Serma in the Mopti Region of Mali. He is also charged with the oversight of JNIM in Burkina Faso and is an explosives expert and instructor.</li>
<li>Ali Mohamed Rage, also known as Ali Dheere, is al-Shabaab’s spokesman and a senior leader of the group.  He replaced Sheikh Mukhtar Robowas al-Shabaab’s top spokesman in May 2009.  Rage has been involved in attack planning that has targeted areas in Kenya and Somalia.</li>
<li>AbdikadirMohamed Abdikadir, also known as Ikrima, is a facilitator and operational planner.  As of November 2019, Abdikadirwas an al-Shabaab senior leader and served as the Head of Operations and Logistics.  Abdikadir had also directed previous attack planning for al-Shabaab.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of our actions today, among other consequences, all property and interests in property of these individuals must be blocked and reported to the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). In addition, persons that engage in certain transactions with the persons designated today may themselves be exposed to designation.  Furthermore, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates a significant financial transaction or provides significant financial services for the persons designated today could be subject to U.S. correspondent account or payable-through account sanctions.</p>
<p>The United States is committed to disrupting the financing methods of ISIS-Mozambique, JNIM, and al-Shabaab &#8212; all of which are designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations and SDGTs &#8212; limiting their abilities to conduct further attacks against civilians and supporting our partners in efforts to disrupt terrorism finance.  Addressing the terrorist threat across the continent will require working closely with our partners to degrade the capacity and operations of these terrorist groups, combatting their control and influence in West, East, and Southern Africa.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States welcomes the appointment of Hans Grundberg as the new UN Special Envoy for Yemen. Grundberg brings considerable expertise on Yemen and the region, and we look forward to working closely with him to advance a durable resolution to the conflict in Yemen.</p>
<p>Now is the time for peace. Seven years of war and instability have devastated Yemen’s economy and eroded even the most basic services, leading to one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. There is unprecedented international and regional consensus on the need to end the Houthi offensive on Marib and other fighting, and on placing renewed emphasis on political talks to finally bring relief to the Yemeni people and allow them to determine a brighter future for their country.</p>
<p>The United States thanks former UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths for his efforts to resolve the conflict in Yemen. We look forward to continuing to work with Griffiths in his new position as the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government of the United States of America, I am honored to congratulate the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the ASEAN Secretariat on the 54th anniversary of the organization’s founding on August 8.</p>
<p>U.S.-ASEAN engagement is now in its fifth decade as it continues to foster a more stable, prosperous, and peaceful region. The strategic partnership between the United States and ASEAN contributes to our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, with ASEAN and ASEAN-led mechanisms as a centerpiece of regional architecture.</p>
<p>This week I had the privilege to participate in the U.S-ASEAN, East Asia Summit (EAS), ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), Mekong-U.S. Partnership, and Friends of the Mekong ministerial meetings. I value deeply the opportunity to interact with our friends at the ASEAN Secretariat, with the representatives from the nations that make up ASEAN, with other important regional stakeholders, and with partners and allies around the world interested in shaping a positive, peaceful and productive future for the ASEAN region.</p>
<p>At these meetings, and in this week’s U.S.-Indonesia Strategic Dialogue with Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, I reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to ASEAN and underscored the central role ASEAN has in our collective vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. To that end, we look forward to additional fruitful engagement in the region when Vice President Harris travels to Singapore and Vietnam this month to continue to discuss our cooperation on pressing regional and international challenges as well as on deepening ties between the people of the United States and the people of the nations of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>I also reaffirmed that the United States would continue to be partners with the countries of ASEAN in the fight against COVID-19. The United States has provided more than 23 million vaccine doses and over $158 million in health and humanitarian assistance to date to ASEAN members to support their response to the pandemic. We will also be there to support the region to build back better from the economic damage wrought by the pandemic by helping drive a green recovery and ensure readiness for future outbreaks. And we continue to be a champion for strong people-to-people ties between the combined one billion population between our countries, demonstrated through our ongoing support for the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) and other cultural, academic, and professional exchanges.</p>
<p>I congratulate ASEAN on its 54th anniversary and look forward to many more years of friendship and collaboration with the organization and the people of Southeast Asia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The text of the following statement was released by the G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union.</p>
<p><i>Begin Text:</i></p>
<p>We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union stand united in our commitment to maritime security and the protection of commercial shipping. We condemn the unlawful attack committed on a merchant vessel off the coast of Oman on 29 July, which killed a British and a Romanian national. This was a deliberate and targeted attack, and a clear violation of international law. All available evidence clearly points to Iran. There is no justification for this attack.</p>
<p>Vessels must be allowed to navigate freely in accordance with international law. We will continue to do our utmost to protect all shipping, upon which the global economy depends, so that it is able to operate freely and without being threatened by irresponsible and violent acts.</p>
<p>Iran’s behaviour, alongside its support to proxy forces and non-state armed actors, threatens international peace and security. We call on Iran to stop all activities inconsistent with relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and call on all parties to play a constructive role in fostering regional stability and peace.</p>

		<title>The United States Restricts Visas of 50 Additional Nicaraguan Individuals Affiliated With Ortega-Murillo Regime</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Department of State has imposed visa restrictions on 50 immediate family members of Nicaraguan National Assembly representatives and Nicaraguan prosecutors and judges. As these actions demonstrate, the United States is committed to promoting broad accountability for anyone responsible for or benefiting from the Ortega-Murillo regime’s attacks on democratic institutions.</p>
<p>In these last two months alone, the regime has arrested 32 political opponents and pro-democracy actors, including seven presidential candidates, a vice-presidential candidate, student activists, private sector leaders, defense attorneys, and others. This includes the detention just this week of 27-year-old Berenice Quezada, a brave Nicaraguan who courageously stepped forward to run for vice president as an opposition candidate despite the increasing repression. Ortega and Murillo once again demonstrated that they are afraid of running against anyone who they feel might win the support of the Nicaraguan people.</p>
<p>In response, on July 12 the Secretary announced visa restrictions against 100 Nicaraguan legislators, judges, prosecutors, and family members of those officials under a visa restriction policy that applies to Nicaraguans believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining democracy, including those with responsibility for, or complicity in, the suppression of peaceful protests or abuse of human rights, and the immediate family members of such persons. Today we are announcing visa restrictions against a further 50 individuals, all immediate family members of regime-affiliated officials who have directly contributed to measures adopted by the Government of Nicaragua that do not meet the conditions for transparent, free, and fair elections to which all OAS member states have committed under the Inter-American Democratic Charter.</p>
<p>As demonstrated by these visa actions and recent sanctions, the United States will continue to use diplomatic and economic tools to promote accountability for those who enable Ortega and Murillo’s repression.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The following is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken met with the foreign ministers of the 26 ARF participating countries, the ASEAN Secretary General, and the EU High Commissioner at the 28th Annual ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Ministerial Meeting hosted by ASEAN Chair Brunei Darussalam.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken underscored the importance of democracy, transparency, and accountability in the Indo-Pacific. He outlined U.S. efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including providing more than 500 million safe and effective vaccine doses to Gavi for distribution by COVAX and 80 million vaccines from the U.S. supply to help countries in need, including 23 million doses for the Indo-Pacific. Secretary Blinken highlighted that the social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had unique impacts on women and girls and voiced support for a gender-responsive approach to the pandemic. Secretary Blinken called on the PRC to abide by its obligations under the international law of the sea and cease its provocative behavior in the South China Sea. He raised serious concerns about ongoing human rights abuses in Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The Secretary also noted deep concern with the rapid growth of the PRC’s nuclear arsenal which highlights how Beijing has sharply deviated from its decades-old nuclear strategy based on minimum deterrence.
