					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States welcomes the arrival today of a truck convoy carrying over 1,700 metric tons of life-saving humanitarian assistance in Tigray. We appreciate the efforts of the government of Ethiopia, Tigrayan regional authorities, and Afar regional authorities in facilitating that delivery. We also commend the United Nations agencies, international organizations, U.S. government partners, and the ongoing efforts of humanitarian organizations across Ethiopia to provide aid to all those in need. We reiterate the importance of significant, sustained, unconditional, and unhindered humanitarian access to Tigray—as well as to all communities that are suffering, including the people in Afar —and the urgency of the resumption of basic services, including electricity, telecommunications, and banking.</p>
<p>The continued commitment of the government of Ethiopia and Tigrayan authorities to a cessation of hostilities remains a critical step toward reconciliation and peace. In that regard, we welcome the withdrawal of Tigrayan forces from Erebti and underscore the importance of further withdrawals from Afar regional state. The parties must continue to build on this progress to advance a negotiated and sustainable end of conflict. Progress toward this goal is an essential foundation for restoration of essential services in Tigray and an inclusive political process to provide security and prosperity for all Ethiopians.</p>

		<title>U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Lenderking Concludes Regional Trip</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>At the end of a three-week trip to Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Qatar by U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking, we have seen U.S. diplomatic efforts yield tangible results that improve the lives of Yemenis and advance peace.  The United States supported the UN’s efforts to secure a two-month truce, which began on April 2 and provides immediate relief to Yemenis by easing the movement of people and goods, including fuel.  In Special Envoy Lenderking’s subsequent engagements, he has urged the parties to adhere to the UN truce terms to pave the way for a viable, durable resolution to the conflict.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the Special Envoy has pressed for transparent, inclusive Yemeni-led efforts to reform the government of Yemen to ensure it meets the needs of all citizens and address their calls for justice, accountability, and redress for human rights violations and abuses.  On April 7, we welcomed Yemen’s establishment of a Presidential Leadership Council, which we urge to advance these goals in partnership with Yemeni civil society and members of marginalized communities.  We urge the Leadership Council to work closely with the Prime Minister and his government to strengthen basic services and economic stability as soon as possible, so that Yemenis can receive the tangible benefits of recent reforms.</p>
<p>During his trip, Special Envoy Lenderking continued his advocacy for additional humanitarian assistance to help close funding gaps that have reduced life-saving assistance for millions of Yemenis, as well as for additional economic assistance to address Yemen’s growing economic crisis.  In this regard, we welcomed the pledge by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to each provide $1 billion in economic support for the Central Bank of Yemen, and Saudi Arabia’s pledge to provide $1 billion for development projects and fuel support as well as $300 million for the UN’s humanitarian response plan.</p>
<p>The Special Envoy concluded his trip by joining a UN-led mission to raise awareness about the threat posed by the derelict <em>Safer </em>oil tanker and raise funds for an emergency UN plan to avert the devastating regional economic, humanitarian, and environmental consequences of a spill.  We commend those who have pledged financial support and encourage other donors to contribute to this new UN-coordinated plan to protect shipping, commerce, tourism, livelihoods, and coastal habitats across the Red Sea.</p>
<p>We must capitalize on this positive, unique momentum by securing a more lasting halt to fighting and a renewed, comprehensive peace process.  Yemenis are expressing cautious optimism for the first time in years as a result of the constructive steps in recent weeks.  All parties to the conflict must answer Yemenis’ demands for peace by choosing dialogue over destruction and cooperating with UN-led peace efforts.  There is hard work ahead and the United States remains committed to supporting the people of Yemen’s aspirations for a more prosperous and stable future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will travel to Panama April 19-20 to co-host a Ministerial Conference on Migration and Protection with the Government of Panama.  Following the commitments expressed at the Regional Migration Ministerial in Colombia in October 2021, Secretary Blinken and representatives of regional governments participating in the Ministerial will discuss collaboration on safe, orderly, and humane migration throughout our hemisphere.  Bringing together leaders from twenty Western Hemisphere nations, this Ministerial represents an important step forward in developing a migration management and protection framework for the Americas.</p>
<p>Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas will join Secretary Blinken in Panama.  The United States will also be represented by State Department Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian A. Nichols and Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees, and Migration Julieta Noyes, DHS Assistant Secretary for International Affairs Serena Hoy, DHS Assistant Secretary for Border and Immigration Policy Blas Nunez Neto, USAID Assistant Administrator for the Bureau of Latin America and the Caribbean Marcela Escobari, and Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Transborder Security Catherine Tobin.</p>
<p>While in Panama, Secretary Blinken will meet with President Laurentino Cortizo Cohen, Foreign Minister Erika Mouynes, multilateral development banks, international financial institutions, international organizations, and NGOs to discuss economic recovery; migration; protection for refugees, asylum seekers, and vulnerable migrants; anti-corruption efforts; and support for civil society, in addition to other regional and bilateral issues of importance to the United States and Panama.  The Secretary will also tour the Panama Canal to review this vital component of regional and international trade and host a roundtable discussion with regional civil society leaders focused on transparency and anti-corruption efforts, a growing challenge for democracy and economic stability in the hemisphere.</p>
<p>Through this visit, the Secretary will draw further attention and excitement in the region towards the Ninth Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, California on June 6-10, 2022, where Western Hemisphere leaders will expand on efforts to address our hemisphere’s most pressing issues with the aim of building a sustainable, resilient, and equitable future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of State has no greater responsibility than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas.  We are committed to providing U.S. citizens with up-to-date and timely information, so they are informed as they make international travel plans and when they are abroad.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Given the increases in international travel, the availability of effective COVID-19 mitigation measures, and recently announced changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) COVID-19 Travel Health Notice (THN) process, we have reassessed how COVID-19 considerations factor into our Travel Advisory levels for U.S. citizens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Starting next week, the State Department Travel Advisory levels will no longer automatically correlate with the CDC COVID-19 THN level.  However, if the CDC raises a country’s COVID-19 THN to a Level 4, the State Department’s Travel Advisory for that country will also be raised to a Level 4: Do Not Travel due to COVID-19.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This update will leave approximately 10% of all Travel Advisories at Level 4: Do Not Travel.  This 10% includes Level 4 Travel Advisories for all risk indicators, not just COVID-19.  We believe the updated framework will help U.S. citizens make better informed decisions about the safety of international travel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Although conditions have recently improved, the COVID-19 pandemic is not over.  We continue to advise travelers to consider COVID-19 conditions and restrictions at their destinations when considering international travel.  Our embassies and consulates around the world will continue to provide the latest country-specific COVID-19-related information on their<span> </span><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/COVID-19-Country-Specific-Information.html">websites</a>.  To see the latest State Department Travel Advisories for any country in the world, visit<span> </span><a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA0MTQuNTY0MTEyNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RyYXZlbC5zdGF0ZS5nb3YvY29udGVudC90cmF2ZWwvZW4vdHJhdmVsYWR2aXNvcmllcy90cmF2ZWxhZHZpc29yaWVzLmh0bWwvIn0.C7cqloGI8MkiT5P5zJpM4iJ8E3yEosgtEjgDjCBlZ8Q%2Fs%2F402704358%2Fbr%2F129806199590-l&amp;data=04%7C01%7CTranMJ%40state.gov%7C4b26ab571062491264f808da1e1ae649%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637855398126092257%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=MpcHcvOH71wY4nTyIrQvuM7wO4f8ge4wSsntlFx2EOU%3D&amp;reserved=0">travel.state.gov</a>.  We encourage U.S. citizens who are considering international travel this summer to check their passport expiration date and act now to renew or apply for the first time.  Keep in mind many countries require passports to have at least six months’ remaining validity for entry.  Routine passport processing can take eight to eleven weeks.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The below is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good morning, everyone.  It is a great pleasure to have my colleague and friend Foreign Minister Hoekstra here.  We’ve been seeing each other at NATO it seems on a now almost regular basis, on the phone, but it’s especially good to have you here in Washington.</p>
<p>And it’s simply evidence of the fact that the partnership between the United States and the Netherlands couldn’t be stronger and also couldn’t be more important.  At a time of tremendous challenge in Europe and around the world, we are standing strongly, resolutely together in support of Ukraine, against Russia’s aggression, in defense of the rules-based order that both of our countries are united in our determination to defend.  We could not be more grateful for this partnership.  It’s a longstanding one, one that we place tremendous value on, and particularly in challenging times it always demonstrates its great value.</p>
<p>So we’re grateful for the leadership that the Netherlands is showing throughout Europe and indeed around the world.  The voice is strong, the voice is important, the voice is valued, and so is the partnership.</p>
<p>We’ve got lots of other things to talk about, but I’m really grateful for the opportunity to actually have you here in Washington and to continue the conversations we’ve been having these many weeks.  So welcome.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER HOEKSTRA:</strong>  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary, Dear Tony. Thank you very much for having us in what is truly an unprecedented era in history.  And it’s also a time where we see more than ever the tremendous importance of the transatlantic bonds.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your leadership, for making sure that you and NATO work seamlessly together, for making sure the excellent bond between our two countries is as strong as ever.  And we will make sure that we continue to work together on all the challenging events – currently Ukraine, but there is much more to do, much more geopolitical challenges that we will face, and we value very much the bilateral bonds but also the excellent relationship between the U.S. and the European Union.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you, all.</p>
