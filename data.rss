					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Thank you.  Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining our call.  We have with us today .   is going to address the current status of the situation following conclusion of the sixth round of talks.  Just as a reminder,  will be speaking today on background.  And you may refer to him as a Senior State Department Official for the purposes of your reporting.</p>
<p>Also as another reminder, this call is embargoed until the conclusion of the call.  And the audio from this session is not for broadcast or replay.  So just one more time, this on background to a Senior State Department Official.  And with that, I’m going to go ahead and turn it over to  for ’s remarks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thank you.  And thanks for doing this again.  I know that in the last few weeks there’s been some confusion, some reporting that may have been – that have added to that confusion.  And part of it could be because we haven’t done one of these some time, so I’m glad to do it again and try to clear up any confusion that may exist.  So I’ll be brief in what I’ll say at the top, just to try to address two issues that I think have caused some of that imprecision.</p>
<p>First, where we are on the talks – and there has been some reporting that we basically have a deal already with Iran, that it’s just a matter of deciding when we’re going to put it out.  Let me make it absolutely clear:  We just concluded round six.  We will be resuming – or coming back for round seven sometime in the not-too-distant future, and we wouldn’t be doing that if the deal were already done.  We still have serious differences that have not been bridged, serious differences with Iran over the host of issues, whether it’s the nuclear steps that Iran needs to take to come back into compliance, the sanctions relief that the U.S. will be offering, or the sequence of steps that both sides would be taking.  Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  And since everything is not agreed, we still don’t have anything nailed down.  And there’s still some very important issues that need to be resolved.  By the same token, we wouldn’t be going back for a seventh round if we didn’t think that a deal was possible.  It remains possible.  It remains our objective, but we’re not there yet, and I’m not going to speculate as to if or when we will get there.</p>
<p>Second point, as to the issue of timing and in particular the impact of the elections (inaudible), first I think we’ve said already what we thought of the elections and of the new president, the fact that this was a pre-manufactured process that did not reflect the will of the Iranian people.  And we also have said what we thought about the background of the president-elect.  That said, from our point of view, it does not affect our determination to try to reach a deal or the pace at which we will go about pursuing it.  We’re not going to second guess any effect that it might have on Iranian decision making, but our goal is to pursue the objective that President Biden laid out both during the campaign and since, which is to try to address – diplomatically by – is our preference – our goal of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>And we believe that diplomacy, by returning to the JCPOA, is the best way to achieve that goal, and we’ll do it with whoever is in power with Iran precisely because we have serious – very serious – differences with their leadership.  And we believe that preventing them from acquiring a nuclear weapon is an important step in then trying to address the other issues that we have with Iran.  Because again, as President Biden and the Secretary of State have made clear, we see the return to the JCPOA as a beginning of a diplomatic process, not at the end, because we have many other issues of concern that we need to raise from Iran’s (inaudible) groups in the region, to its ballistic missile program, to its many other destabilizing activities.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say a word about an issue which is as important as anything I’ve said already, which is the issue of American citizens who are wrongfully detained in Iran.  That I still need to raise this, that they’re still not home, is a scandal and one that we are fighting every day to address.  And for Ahmad, for Siamak, for Baquer, for Morad, this is our priority.  We will not rest until they’re home and we’ll do everything in our power to make sure that that the day comes very, very soon.</p>
<p>So with that, I’m happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Great.  Thank you.  Let’s please go to the line of Nick Wadhams.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment, please.  Wait until I announce your line is open before speaking.  And Nick, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Thanks very much.  , understanding that you have differences on sequencing, do you – can you give us a sense for how the oil waivers would fit into this, whether you would grant waivers on day one or hold out to issue waivers until later on, maybe two to three months after the IAEA confirms compliance?  And would you be willing to give waivers without an IAEA confirmation of compliance?  And then second, can you just comment on the idea that the clock is ticking here because if too much time goes on, Iran will advance so far technologically that the original terms of the JCPOA essentially become moot, and you would have to negotiate an entirely new deal?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>So thanks, Nick.  So as to the first question, this may apply to a number of questions we’re going to get.  However much we’d prefer to be negotiating with the press corps than with Iran, it’s not what we’re going to do, so I’d rather – I won’t get into the details of what our position is on various issues, so I’ll skip the first question.</p>
<p>The second one about the clock, listen, there’s no – it’s not like there’s a scientific time at which point that threshold that you mentioned will be crossed, but certainly time is not a positive factor.  And this process won’t be open indefinitely, so we’re trying to get back into the deal.  We understand Iran is continuing to make progress, which is precisely why we believe withdrawing from the deal was a mistake and why we’re faced with this situation.  We’re going to try to get them back as soon as possible under the terms of the deal.  If it’s not done quickly and if Iran continues to make progress, of course it’s something that we’re going to have to consider in terms of the provisions of the deal that we’d be prepared to accept.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Let’s go to the line of Lara Jakes.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment.  And Lara, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.  And Lara, please check your mute button.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yes.  I’m sorry.  I was, in fact, on mute.  Apologies.  Thanks.  And  a minute ago you said that we see the return to the JCPOA as the beginning of the process and not the end.  Iran’s new president has very clearly said that he will not consider a longer and stronger deal for reining in the missile’s programs and the proxies.  So I’m wondering why you think that delta can be resolved.  And I’m also wondering if you’d speak a little bit about the IAEA inspections agreement that is, I think, expiring today.  I believe there’s a tentative agreement for it to be extended again.  Is that a reason for optimism?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks, Lara.  So on the first point, yeah, we’ve heard what President-Elect Raisi said.  Frankly, that’s not very different from what other Iranian leaders have been saying for some time.  But we’ve been equally clear, crystal-clear, and President Biden was crystal-clear on this, from the campaign and from his first day in office, which is that we believe that we can – are going to need to discuss other issues after we – assuming we get back into the JCPOA.  There are many issues of concern that we have, but also there’s issues that Iran wants to address, and they’ve made that very clear to us, including during this talks, that they – there are some elements that they are asking for, which go beyond the terms of the JCPOA.  So our position remains the same, that we see the return to the JCPOA as a beginning of a diplomatic process, and we believe that we’re going to need to engage in discussions with Iran, various things to address those other issues.  So we’ll have to find a way to resolve that difference.</p>
<p>On the IAEA, it’s good that you mention it.  Obviously we are concerned that at – from the time that I’m speaking – maybe there’s been news since – in the last hour or so, but we have not heard that there’s been an understanding.  If one is reached, that would be positive.  Although, we shouldn’t be playing – Iran should not be playing brinkmanship each time these agreements get extended.  I’d simply say that in the absence of such an understanding, in the absence of the IAEA being able to monitor what Iran is doing, it will be that much more complicated to get back into the JCPOA, because we’re going to have to know what the baseline of their nuclear program is.  And if the IAEA is blind for a certain amount of time and we don’t know what that baseline is, it’s going to be much more difficult to find a way back into the deal.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Jennifer Hansler.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Jennifer, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, .  Thanks so much for doing this.  What are you telling the Iranians about guarantees that the U.S. won’t quit the deal in four years?  How are you assuaging their concerns on that?  And on the issue of the hostages, has there been any progress towards their release?  Is it still the case that their release is not a precondition for the U.S. re-entering the JCPOA?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks.  So, I mean, there is no such thing as a guarantee, and I think Iran knows it and we know it.  We have no guarantee; they have no guarantee.  That’s the way the JCPOA is built, that if one side violated, the other side would – its remedy would be to take countermanding steps.  But what we do think is that the best guarantee is to get back into the deal and to implement it faithfully, and that’s – and we think that there’s a – that’s the best answer, because there is no such thing as a guarantee.</p>
<p>Secondly, on the question of the detainees, it’s the same thing as I said about the deal.  Because nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, because we don’t have a deal yet, I’m not going to speak about how close we are.  Yet, we’ve made progress.  We were engaged in indirect discussions with Iran about their release, but we’re not there yet, and until we’re there I don&#8217;t want to give false hopes to the families who’ve suffered too much already.  And as I’ve said in the past, it is a priority, and we are absolutely insistent that the four American citizens who are wrongfully detained be released.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  And let’s go the line of Arshad Mohammed.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Arshad, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.  And Arshad, please check your mute button.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you, and sorry about mute.  Two things.  One, would you continue the negotiations if Iran fails to extend its agreement with the IAEA?  And secondly, you said this process will not be open indefinitely.  What happens if you cannot reach an agreement by August 3rd, the date on which the Raisi administration takes office?  Is that when the door closes?  Or is the door open?  It may be indefinite, but it could be open for months or even years?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks.  And I know that both two good but difficult questions.  We still hope that Iran will extend its technical understanding with the IAEA or find – not prolong the understandings that currently exist.  As I said, it would be an issue of real concern if they didn’t.  I’m not going to speculate as to what impact it would have on the talks, but I think it is – we’ve already indicated clearly to Iran that it would be extremely complicated if they – a complicating factor if they did not find a way to continue the understandings with the IAEA.</p>
<p>On your second question, again, I’m not going to sit here and say there’s a deadline.  Obviously this will be a decision for the President and his national security team to take.  But when we’ve said – and others have said it – that this process is not going to be open forever, we mean it.  We – this is not something that we could go on indefinitely.  There’s – we’ve had serious discussions, and I don’t – as I’ve said, we’ve made progress, and the Iranians have been serious in the talks so far, but we do have differences.  And if we can’t bridge them in the foreseeable future, I think we’re going to have to regroup and figure out how we move ahead.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Courtney McBride.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Courtney, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  So assuming – I understand that you are loathe to talk about timelines, but how does the administration hope to get follow-on talks with President-elect Raisi?  And how do you – do you acknowledge that he would need to be removed from the sanctions list as part of a broader discussion in hope of a broader agreement with Iran?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  So, I mean, I’ll repeat what I said about the follow-on talks.  I think we couldn’t have been clearer about what our position is on that, that we think – we believe that it has to be a part of what – of the process that we’re discussing right now, and we’re in the middle of discussing the nature of what those talks could be.  We know what Iran’s position is, but that’s why one of their – these are one of many reasons that we are still engaged in the talks and why we haven’t concluded them yet.</p>
<p>And I’ll also add again that there are issues that Iran feels that need to be addressed which go beyond the four corners of the JCPOA, and the only way to address those is going to be by continuing conversations in some format with us, and so we believe that this is something that’s not just a U.S. interest.  It happens to also be an Iranian interest, although they’ll be a better judge of that.</p>
<p>And on the question of sanctions, I think National Security Advisor Sullivan addressed it the other day.  We’re not going to get into details of what we might do.  We’re going to look at what we – what sanctions relief we believe we need to take in order to be back in compliance with the JCPOA, and that’s what we’re going to be judging in terms of the steps that we’ll be prepared to take if – and I emphasize if we’re back in a deal.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Okay.  Let’s go to the line of Michel Ghandour.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Michel, go ahead.  Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah, thank you for doing this.  There are calls from the Congress to the administration to take the election of President Raisi as an opportunity for not joining or rejoining the JCPOA.  What’s your answer to that?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  My answer to that:  We’re not involved in negotiations because we trust, like, or have anything or share any values in common with our Iranian counterparts.  We’re doing it precisely because we have very deep concerns, very serious issues.  And so the fact that there is now a new president – or there will soon be a new president of Iran does not detract our core national security interest, which is to reach a deal that puts their nuclear program in a box and makes sure that we prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  The identity of the Iranian president doesn’t have an impact on that, core national security interests.  And I would add, again, as the National Security Advisor said, that we know that the president in the Iranian system is not the sole and not even the chief decision-maker.  It’s a leadership in which the supreme leader has the ultimate word, and that position, that person has not changed as a result of the Iranian elections.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Laura Rosen.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Laura, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  , as I understand, not all the other countries in the P4+1 agree there should be a follow-on deal.  Can you speak to that?  I mean, I think Russia especially has said they think the JCPOA is sufficient.  So does that affect something being in a document with Iran that would call for follow-on talks?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Our position is our position.  We’ve had many conversations with Russia, and I wouldn’t characterize &#8212;</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  I think somebody’s on this call.  I think I recognize their voice, but yeah, okay.  So I’m saying we know – we had many discussions with our Russian colleagues about this.  I’m not going to characterize their position.  I think many countries have agreed that they want more diplomacy with Iran to address a range of issues, including regional issues, and Russia has been at the – one of the parties that has put forward ideas for what that diplomacy could look like.  So I’m not sure that I would fully agree with how you put it, but there are differences of views, but our position is very clear – is that we’re going to need follow-on talks, discussions to strengthen the deal.</p>
<p>And again, we would make the point that this is not only something that we think would help us.  We do think that it would help – it would – it should be in Iran’s interest because they have issues that they’re going to want to bring to the table.  Of course, that – as I said, that’s going to be – they will have to make that assessment, but our position has been clear from the day we started these talks and very familiar to all the parties who are there, and they know that’s America’s position.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  We have time for just a couple more questions.  Let’s go to the line of Nadia Bilbassy.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And one moment.  Nadia, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you so much.  Thank you,  and , for doing this.</p>
<p>, you just said that nothing agreed until all agreed.  You have been – it’s been six sessions so far and you’re entering the seventh.  Can you just outline for us what exactly you agreed upon?  Is it just a framework, is it technical issues, is it more than that?</p>
<p>And second, I’m sure you have seen the statements coming from the (inaudible) office saying that you’re going to lift sanction on the supreme leader.  Do you see this as, like, a (inaudible)?  Is it a lie from the Iranian?  Is it propaganda trying to get you to where they want?  How do you see it?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks, Nadia.  So if I understood your question, I mean, when I say nothing’s agreed until everything is agreed, that’s precisely what I meant.  So there’s nothing.  It’s not like there’s a framework or – we are still negotiating every issue, whether it’s the scope of sanctions relief, the scope of the steps that Iran will take to come back into compliance with its nuclear obligations, the sequence – all of those are still being discussed, and so we don’t have like a provisional deal on anything.  We are still working through all the issues, and that includes the issues of sanctions that you mentioned.  We will have to see.</p>
<p>And again, I don’t want – I’m not going to negotiate in public, but at this point we need to continue negotiating to see whether we could reach a comprehensive package that will be satisfactory, and at this point we’re not there yet.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Let’s go to the line of Farhad Pouladi.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>And Farhad, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yes, hi.  Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yes, we hear you.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>Yes, we can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Perfect.  So my question is in regard to the Israeli Government’s comments on the JCPOA, or the JCPOA resurrection talks in Vienna.  Prime Minister Netanyahu was staunchly against the deal, but the position has been actually transferred to the new government and they are still against the JCPOA.  I covered what comments came out of General Kochavi’s visit yesterday and today.  And also today, Prime Minister Bennett says that this regime – the one that no one should do business with.  How concerned are you that they may take any unilateral action, and what has the Biden administration been doing to persuade them not to do anything to jeopardize the talks?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thank you, Farhad.  That’s an important question.  I want to start by saying we – under the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu, we were having close consultations.  We know – we knew that they have and we know they had a different view about the JCPOA, but we are trying to talk to them to make sure that we were as aligned as possible given our common objective, which is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  We had differences about the JCPOA.  We knew that, we recognized it, but we nonetheless were working closely with them.</p>
<p>And the same holds for the government of Prime Minister Bennett.  We already had some high-level contacts.  I think you all know that Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lapid will be meeting in Rome on Sunday.  I don’t know the agenda, but I would be surprised if Iran did not figure in those conversations.  And again, we respect that they have a different point of view.  I think they respect ours and we are going to try to talk and be as transparent and as coordinated as possible so that the ultimate goal, which we share, is one that is pursued as effectively as possible.  And we expect to have extremely positive and productive discussions with the new Israeli Government and we look forward to as close coordination as possible.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Okay, thanks.  Just a couple more questions.  Let’s go to the line of Halley Toosi.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment.  And Halley, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, thanks for doing this.  A couple questions.  When it comes to the follow-on agreements, does the United States want to include human rights as one of the issues that is negotiated along with ballistic missiles and support for terrorism and all that?</p>
<p>Secondly, you said that there are indirect talks on the hostages.  Can you tell us a little bit more about those discussions?  Like are you talking about a potential prisoner exchange, and is it totally on a separate track from the nuclear discussion?  Any information you can give on that.</p>
<p>And also lastly, what is the most surprising thing that’s happened in this process for you?  What’s something you just didn’t expect, but that’s come up?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thanks.  So on the follow-on talks, listen, we know that there are a number of issues that – concerns that we have above and beyond the nuclear issue which is central.  There are lots of concerns.  Some of them will be negotiated in some formal way, others will be dealt with through other means.  So I’m not going to get into the details of what they will cover, but we – all of the issues you mentioned and that I mentioned are issues of real concern to this administration, but the format, the shape that those discussions or other diplomatic tools will take to address them I won’t get into.  But again, it doesn’t mean that we’re going to ignore any issue.  All of them will be pursued in one fashion or another.</p>
<p>On the detainee issue, they are separate.  These are separate conversations that are being held.  Obviously, we – we’re doing them more intensely when we are in Vienna because we could get communication to a third party more quickly, but they’re separate from the nuclear talks and, as I said, they are absolute priority.  Regardless of what happens with the JCPOA, we want our detainees, our citizens, wrongfully-held citizens back home as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Out of what’s been most surprising, I’m at a loss to say.  I mean, it is unusual to have these discussions in an indirect fashion.  I’ve said that many times before.  It is ripe for misunderstanding.  It’s ripe for prolonging the talks.  It’s not the most effective way to do it.  It means that we spend a lot of time in hotel rooms with our European and other colleagues and not with the party that we’re supposed to be negotiating with.  But by this point, we’ve gotten used to it, so we’ll make do.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  And I think we have time for one more question.  Let’s go to Arshad Mohammed.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Arshad, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah, thanks for coming back to me.  Just to ask one specific question, do you have any idea now when the seventh round of talks will begin in Vienna?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  No.  I mean, we assume that there is obviously consultations going on in Iran given – in Tehran given the election.  And when those consultations will have concluded, we will be notified, and then we’ll figure out when we meet again.  But at this point, I don’t have – I don’t have any plane reservations.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Okay, I think that’s our last question.  I just want to quickly thank our senior State Department official, .  Just as a reminder to everyone, this call today is on background, and so you can refer to our briefer as a senior State Department official.  With that, this briefing is ended and the embargo is lifted.  Have a good day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Thank you.  Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining our call.  We have with us today .   is going to address the current status of the situation following conclusion of the sixth round of talks.  Just as a reminder,  will be speaking today on background.  And you may refer to him as a Senior State Department Official for the purposes of your reporting.</p>
<p>Also as another reminder, this call is embargoed until the conclusion of the call.  And the audio from this session is not for broadcast or replay.  So just one more time, this on background to a Senior State Department Official.  And with that, I’m going to go ahead and turn it over to  for ’s remarks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thank you.  And thanks for doing this again.  I know that in the last few weeks there’s been some confusion, some reporting that may have been – that have added to that confusion.  And part of it could be because we haven’t done one of these some time, so I’m glad to do it again and try to clear up any confusion that may exist.  So I’ll be brief in what I’ll say at the top, just to try to address two issues that I think have caused some of that imprecision.</p>
<p>First, where we are on the talks – and there has been some reporting that we basically have a deal already with Iran, that it’s just a matter of deciding when we’re going to put it out.  Let me make it absolutely clear:  We just concluded round six.  We will be resuming – or coming back for round seven sometime in the not-too-distant future, and we wouldn’t be doing that if the deal were already done.  We still have serious differences that have not been bridged, serious differences with Iran over the host of issues, whether it’s the nuclear steps that Iran needs to take to come back into compliance, the sanctions relief that the U.S. will be offering, or the sequence of steps that both sides would be taking.  Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  And since everything is not agreed, we still don’t have anything nailed down.  And there’s still some very important issues that need to be resolved.  By the same token, we wouldn’t be going back for a seventh round if we didn’t think that a deal was possible.  It remains possible.  It remains our objective, but we’re not there yet, and I’m not going to speculate as to if or when we will get there.</p>
<p>Second point, as to the issue of timing and in particular the impact of the elections (inaudible), first I think we’ve said already what we thought of the elections and of the new president, the fact that this was a pre-manufactured process that did not reflect the will of the Iranian people.  And we also have said what we thought about the background of the president-elect.  That said, from our point of view, it does not affect our determination to try to reach a deal or the pace at which we will go about pursuing it.  We’re not going to second guess any effect that it might have on Iranian decision making, but our goal is to pursue the objective that President Biden laid out both during the campaign and since, which is to try to address – diplomatically by – is our preference – our goal of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>And we believe that diplomacy, by returning to the JCPOA, is the best way to achieve that goal, and we’ll do it with whoever is in power with Iran precisely because we have serious – very serious – differences with their leadership.  And we believe that preventing them from acquiring a nuclear weapon is an important step in then trying to address the other issues that we have with Iran.  Because again, as President Biden and the Secretary of State have made clear, we see the return to the JCPOA as a beginning of a diplomatic process, not at the end, because we have many other issues of concern that we need to raise from Iran’s (inaudible) groups in the region, to its ballistic missile program, to its many other destabilizing activities.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say a word about an issue which is as important as anything I’ve said already, which is the issue of American citizens who are wrongfully detained in Iran.  That I still need to raise this, that they’re still not home, is a scandal and one that we are fighting every day to address.  And for Ahmad, for Siamak, for Baquer, for Morad, this is our priority.  We will not rest until they’re home and we’ll do everything in our power to make sure that that the day comes very, very soon.</p>
<p>So with that, I’m happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Great.  Thank you.  Let’s please go to the line of Nick Wadhams.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment, please.  Wait until I announce your line is open before speaking.  And Nick, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Thanks very much.  , understanding that you have differences on sequencing, do you – can you give us a sense for how the oil waivers would fit into this, whether you would grant waivers on day one or hold out to issue waivers until later on, maybe two to three months after the IAEA confirms compliance?  And would you be willing to give waivers without an IAEA confirmation of compliance?  And then second, can you just comment on the idea that the clock is ticking here because if too much time goes on, Iran will advance so far technologically that the original terms of the JCPOA essentially become moot, and you would have to negotiate an entirely new deal?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>So thanks, Nick.  So as to the first question, this may apply to a number of questions we’re going to get.  However much we’d prefer to be negotiating with the press corps than with Iran, it’s not what we’re going to do, so I’d rather – I won’t get into the details of what our position is on various issues, so I’ll skip the first question.</p>
<p>The second one about the clock, listen, there’s no – it’s not like there’s a scientific time at which point that threshold that you mentioned will be crossed, but certainly time is not a positive factor.  And this process won’t be open indefinitely, so we’re trying to get back into the deal.  We understand Iran is continuing to make progress, which is precisely why we believe withdrawing from the deal was a mistake and why we’re faced with this situation.  We’re going to try to get them back as soon as possible under the terms of the deal.  If it’s not done quickly and if Iran continues to make progress, of course it’s something that we’re going to have to consider in terms of the provisions of the deal that we’d be prepared to accept.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Let’s go to the line of Lara Jakes.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment.  And Lara, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.  And Lara, please check your mute button.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yes.  I’m sorry.  I was, in fact, on mute.  Apologies.  Thanks.  And  a minute ago you said that we see the return to the JCPOA as the beginning of the process and not the end.  Iran’s new president has very clearly said that he will not consider a longer and stronger deal for reining in the missile’s programs and the proxies.  So I’m wondering why you think that delta can be resolved.  And I’m also wondering if you’d speak a little bit about the IAEA inspections agreement that is, I think, expiring today.  I believe there’s a tentative agreement for it to be extended again.  Is that a reason for optimism?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks, Lara.  So on the first point, yeah, we’ve heard what President-Elect Raisi said.  Frankly, that’s not very different from what other Iranian leaders have been saying for some time.  But we’ve been equally clear, crystal-clear, and President Biden was crystal-clear on this, from the campaign and from his first day in office, which is that we believe that we can – are going to need to discuss other issues after we – assuming we get back into the JCPOA.  There are many issues of concern that we have, but also there’s issues that Iran wants to address, and they’ve made that very clear to us, including during this talks, that they – there are some elements that they are asking for, which go beyond the terms of the JCPOA.  So our position remains the same, that we see the return to the JCPOA as a beginning of a diplomatic process, and we believe that we’re going to need to engage in discussions with Iran, various things to address those other issues.  So we’ll have to find a way to resolve that difference.</p>
<p>On the IAEA, it’s good that you mention it.  Obviously we are concerned that at – from the time that I’m speaking – maybe there’s been news since – in the last hour or so, but we have not heard that there’s been an understanding.  If one is reached, that would be positive.  Although, we shouldn’t be playing – Iran should not be playing brinkmanship each time these agreements get extended.  I’d simply say that in the absence of such an understanding, in the absence of the IAEA being able to monitor what Iran is doing, it will be that much more complicated to get back into the JCPOA, because we’re going to have to know what the baseline of their nuclear program is.  And if the IAEA is blind for a certain amount of time and we don’t know what that baseline is, it’s going to be much more difficult to find a way back into the deal.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Jennifer Hansler.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Jennifer, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, .  Thanks so much for doing this.  What are you telling the Iranians about guarantees that the U.S. won’t quit the deal in four years?  How are you assuaging their concerns on that?  And on the issue of the hostages, has there been any progress towards their release?  Is it still the case that their release is not a precondition for the U.S. re-entering the JCPOA?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks.  So, I mean, there is no such thing as a guarantee, and I think Iran knows it and we know it.  We have no guarantee; they have no guarantee.  That’s the way the JCPOA is built, that if one side violated, the other side would – its remedy would be to take countermanding steps.  But what we do think is that the best guarantee is to get back into the deal and to implement it faithfully, and that’s – and we think that there’s a – that’s the best answer, because there is no such thing as a guarantee.</p>
<p>Secondly, on the question of the detainees, it’s the same thing as I said about the deal.  Because nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, because we don’t have a deal yet, I’m not going to speak about how close we are.  Yet, we’ve made progress.  We were engaged in indirect discussions with Iran about their release, but we’re not there yet, and until we’re there I don&#8217;t want to give false hopes to the families who’ve suffered too much already.  And as I’ve said in the past, it is a priority, and we are absolutely insistent that the four American citizens who are wrongfully detained be released.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  And let’s go the line of Arshad Mohammed.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Arshad, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.  And Arshad, please check your mute button.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you, and sorry about mute.  Two things.  One, would you continue the negotiations if Iran fails to extend its agreement with the IAEA?  And secondly, you said this process will not be open indefinitely.  What happens if you cannot reach an agreement by August 3rd, the date on which the Raisi administration takes office?  Is that when the door closes?  Or is the door open?  It may be indefinite, but it could be open for months or even years?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks.  And I know that both two good but difficult questions.  We still hope that Iran will extend its technical understanding with the IAEA or find – not prolong the understandings that currently exist.  As I said, it would be an issue of real concern if they didn’t.  I’m not going to speculate as to what impact it would have on the talks, but I think it is – we’ve already indicated clearly to Iran that it would be extremely complicated if they – a complicating factor if they did not find a way to continue the understandings with the IAEA.</p>
<p>On your second question, again, I’m not going to sit here and say there’s a deadline.  Obviously this will be a decision for the President and his national security team to take.  But when we’ve said – and others have said it – that this process is not going to be open forever, we mean it.  We – this is not something that we could go on indefinitely.  There’s – we’ve had serious discussions, and I don’t – as I’ve said, we’ve made progress, and the Iranians have been serious in the talks so far, but we do have differences.  And if we can’t bridge them in the foreseeable future, I think we’re going to have to regroup and figure out how we move ahead.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Courtney McBride.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Courtney, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  So assuming – I understand that you are loathe to talk about timelines, but how does the administration hope to get follow-on talks with President-elect Raisi?  And how do you – do you acknowledge that he would need to be removed from the sanctions list as part of a broader discussion in hope of a broader agreement with Iran?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  So, I mean, I’ll repeat what I said about the follow-on talks.  I think we couldn’t have been clearer about what our position is on that, that we think – we believe that it has to be a part of what – of the process that we’re discussing right now, and we’re in the middle of discussing the nature of what those talks could be.  We know what Iran’s position is, but that’s why one of their – these are one of many reasons that we are still engaged in the talks and why we haven’t concluded them yet.</p>
<p>And I’ll also add again that there are issues that Iran feels that need to be addressed which go beyond the four corners of the JCPOA, and the only way to address those is going to be by continuing conversations in some format with us, and so we believe that this is something that’s not just a U.S. interest.  It happens to also be an Iranian interest, although they’ll be a better judge of that.</p>
<p>And on the question of sanctions, I think National Security Advisor Sullivan addressed it the other day.  We’re not going to get into details of what we might do.  We’re going to look at what we – what sanctions relief we believe we need to take in order to be back in compliance with the JCPOA, and that’s what we’re going to be judging in terms of the steps that we’ll be prepared to take if – and I emphasize if we’re back in a deal.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Okay.  Let’s go to the line of Michel Ghandour.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Michel, go ahead.  Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah, thank you for doing this.  There are calls from the Congress to the administration to take the election of President Raisi as an opportunity for not joining or rejoining the JCPOA.  What’s your answer to that?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  My answer to that:  We’re not involved in negotiations because we trust, like, or have anything or share any values in common with our Iranian counterparts.  We’re doing it precisely because we have very deep concerns, very serious issues.  And so the fact that there is now a new president – or there will soon be a new president of Iran does not detract our core national security interest, which is to reach a deal that puts their nuclear program in a box and makes sure that we prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  The identity of the Iranian president doesn’t have an impact on that, core national security interests.  And I would add, again, as the National Security Advisor said, that we know that the president in the Iranian system is not the sole and not even the chief decision-maker.  It’s a leadership in which the supreme leader has the ultimate word, and that position, that person has not changed as a result of the Iranian elections.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Laura Rosen.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Laura, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  , as I understand, not all the other countries in the P4+1 agree there should be a follow-on deal.  Can you speak to that?  I mean, I think Russia especially has said they think the JCPOA is sufficient.  So does that affect something being in a document with Iran that would call for follow-on talks?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Our position is our position.  We’ve had many conversations with Russia, and I wouldn’t characterize &#8212;</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  I think somebody’s on this call.  I think I recognize their voice, but yeah, okay.  So I’m saying we know – we had many discussions with our Russian colleagues about this.  I’m not going to characterize their position.  I think many countries have agreed that they want more diplomacy with Iran to address a range of issues, including regional issues, and Russia has been at the – one of the parties that has put forward ideas for what that diplomacy could look like.  So I’m not sure that I would fully agree with how you put it, but there are differences of views, but our position is very clear – is that we’re going to need follow-on talks, discussions to strengthen the deal.</p>
<p>And again, we would make the point that this is not only something that we think would help us.  We do think that it would help – it would – it should be in Iran’s interest because they have issues that they’re going to want to bring to the table.  Of course, that – as I said, that’s going to be – they will have to make that assessment, but our position has been clear from the day we started these talks and very familiar to all the parties who are there, and they know that’s America’s position.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  We have time for just a couple more questions.  Let’s go to the line of Nadia Bilbassy.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And one moment.  Nadia, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you so much.  Thank you,  and , for doing this.</p>
<p>, you just said that nothing agreed until all agreed.  You have been – it’s been six sessions so far and you’re entering the seventh.  Can you just outline for us what exactly you agreed upon?  Is it just a framework, is it technical issues, is it more than that?</p>
<p>And second, I’m sure you have seen the statements coming from the (inaudible) office saying that you’re going to lift sanction on the supreme leader.  Do you see this as, like, a (inaudible)?  Is it a lie from the Iranian?  Is it propaganda trying to get you to where they want?  How do you see it?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks, Nadia.  So if I understood your question, I mean, when I say nothing’s agreed until everything is agreed, that’s precisely what I meant.  So there’s nothing.  It’s not like there’s a framework or – we are still negotiating every issue, whether it’s the scope of sanctions relief, the scope of the steps that Iran will take to come back into compliance with its nuclear obligations, the sequence – all of those are still being discussed, and so we don’t have like a provisional deal on anything.  We are still working through all the issues, and that includes the issues of sanctions that you mentioned.  We will have to see.</p>
<p>And again, I don’t want – I’m not going to negotiate in public, but at this point we need to continue negotiating to see whether we could reach a comprehensive package that will be satisfactory, and at this point we’re not there yet.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Let’s go to the line of Farhad Pouladi.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>And Farhad, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yes, hi.  Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yes, we hear you.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>Yes, we can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Perfect.  So my question is in regard to the Israeli Government’s comments on the JCPOA, or the JCPOA resurrection talks in Vienna.  Prime Minister Netanyahu was staunchly against the deal, but the position has been actually transferred to the new government and they are still against the JCPOA.  I covered what comments came out of General Kochavi’s visit yesterday and today.  And also today, Prime Minister Bennett says that this regime – the one that no one should do business with.  How concerned are you that they may take any unilateral action, and what has the Biden administration been doing to persuade them not to do anything to jeopardize the talks?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thank you, Farhad.  That’s an important question.  I want to start by saying we – under the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu, we were having close consultations.  We know – we knew that they have and we know they had a different view about the JCPOA, but we are trying to talk to them to make sure that we were as aligned as possible given our common objective, which is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  We had differences about the JCPOA.  We knew that, we recognized it, but we nonetheless were working closely with them.</p>
<p>And the same holds for the government of Prime Minister Bennett.  We already had some high-level contacts.  I think you all know that Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lapid will be meeting in Rome on Sunday.  I don’t know the agenda, but I would be surprised if Iran did not figure in those conversations.  And again, we respect that they have a different point of view.  I think they respect ours and we are going to try to talk and be as transparent and as coordinated as possible so that the ultimate goal, which we share, is one that is pursued as effectively as possible.  And we expect to have extremely positive and productive discussions with the new Israeli Government and we look forward to as close coordination as possible.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Okay, thanks.  Just a couple more questions.  Let’s go to the line of Halley Toosi.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment.  And Halley, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, thanks for doing this.  A couple questions.  When it comes to the follow-on agreements, does the United States want to include human rights as one of the issues that is negotiated along with ballistic missiles and support for terrorism and all that?</p>
<p>Secondly, you said that there are indirect talks on the hostages.  Can you tell us a little bit more about those discussions?  Like are you talking about a potential prisoner exchange, and is it totally on a separate track from the nuclear discussion?  Any information you can give on that.</p>
<p>And also lastly, what is the most surprising thing that’s happened in this process for you?  What’s something you just didn’t expect, but that’s come up?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thanks.  So on the follow-on talks, listen, we know that there are a number of issues that – concerns that we have above and beyond the nuclear issue which is central.  There are lots of concerns.  Some of them will be negotiated in some formal way, others will be dealt with through other means.  So I’m not going to get into the details of what they will cover, but we – all of the issues you mentioned and that I mentioned are issues of real concern to this administration, but the format, the shape that those discussions or other diplomatic tools will take to address them I won’t get into.  But again, it doesn’t mean that we’re going to ignore any issue.  All of them will be pursued in one fashion or another.</p>
<p>On the detainee issue, they are separate.  These are separate conversations that are being held.  Obviously, we – we’re doing them more intensely when we are in Vienna because we could get communication to a third party more quickly, but they’re separate from the nuclear talks and, as I said, they are absolute priority.  Regardless of what happens with the JCPOA, we want our detainees, our citizens, wrongfully-held citizens back home as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Out of what’s been most surprising, I’m at a loss to say.  I mean, it is unusual to have these discussions in an indirect fashion.  I’ve said that many times before.  It is ripe for misunderstanding.  It’s ripe for prolonging the talks.  It’s not the most effective way to do it.  It means that we spend a lot of time in hotel rooms with our European and other colleagues and not with the party that we’re supposed to be negotiating with.  But by this point, we’ve gotten used to it, so we’ll make do.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  And I think we have time for one more question.  Let’s go to Arshad Mohammed.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Arshad, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah, thanks for coming back to me.  Just to ask one specific question, do you have any idea now when the seventh round of talks will begin in Vienna?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  No.  I mean, we assume that there is obviously consultations going on in Iran given – in Tehran given the election.  And when those consultations will have concluded, we will be notified, and then we’ll figure out when we meet again.  But at this point, I don’t have – I don’t have any plane reservations.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Okay, I think that’s our last question.  I just want to quickly thank our senior State Department official, .  Just as a reminder to everyone, this call today is on background, and so you can refer to our briefer as a senior State Department official.  With that, this briefing is ended and the embargo is lifted.  Have a good day.</p>

<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe</p>
<p><strong>MR NEUMARKER:</strong>  (In German.)  Dear Mr. Secretary of State of the United States of America.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) So everyone, I’d like to welcome you all here, and Minister Maas, (inaudible), also the vice president of the German association of Sinti and Roma in Germany, Mr. Romani Rose.</p>
<p>(In German.)</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) And I am the head and the chairperson of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe.  I’d like to hand over now to the moderator, Ms. Sauerbrey.</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and most importantly, also survivors.  And ladies and gentlemen, the memory of the Holocaust, to research it and also to then – also give this on to new generations this year in the U.S. and Germany.  We’ll then now sign a letter of intent on this.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken will speak to us.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good morning.  Foreign Minister Maas, Heiko, thank you for your partnership in launching what will be a historic dialogue.</p>
<p>Eighty years ago this week, Nazi forces invaded the Soviet-occupied city of Bialystok, Poland.  They pulled Jews from their homes, beat them, executed many on the spot.  Some forced older Jewish men to dance, and if they didn’t like the performance, set their beards on fire.</p>
<p>Then the Nazis herded more than 700 Jews into Bialystok’s synagogue and set it ablaze.</p>
<p>What happened in Bialystok was not isolated.  The barbarism was systematic.</p>
<p>By launching the U.S-Germany Dialogue on the Holocaust, we are helping to ensure that current and future generations learn about the Holocaust and also learn from it.</p>
<p>Together, we honor those who were killed.  They were not indistinct numbers, even if a number is seared in the minds of many of us.  But they were not just numbers.  They were not, as their killers saw them, indistinct, inhuman.  They were family members, they were friends, mothers, fathers, daughters, sisters, loved ones, human beings.</p>
<p>We honor the survivors who share their stories with enormous courage and determination, including those here today: Margot Friedlander, Franz Michalski, Peter Johan Gardosch.  You honor us with your presence, you honor us with your testimony, you honor us with your memory.</p>
<p>We study the past so that we can understand the Holocaust as more than the final act of exterminating six million Jews as well as Roma and Sinti, Slavs, disabled persons, LGBTQ individuals, and many others.  It was the culmination of countless individual steps designed to vilify and dehumanize people.</p>
<p>So we learned, for example, that as early as 1933, Jews were purged from Germany’s civil service, Jewish businesses boycotted, books by Jewish authors banned and burned in a massive pyre not very far from where we stand today.</p>
<p>Like the path through this memorial, the Shoah was not a sharp fall, but a gradual descent into darkness.  As survivor Primo Levi wrote, “To sink is the easiest of matters…like streams that run down to the sea.”</p>
<p>That understanding is particularly urgent today as survivors pass from us and those who deny the Holocaust are getting louder and finding insidious new ways to spread their lies.</p>
<p>A recent study found that during the pandemic, anti-Semitic content online increased seven-fold in French, thirteen-fold in German.</p>
<p>In recent months, a swastika was carved onto the door of a synagogue in America, museums dedicated to the Holocaust were defaced.</p>
<p>Today, as in the past, Holocaust denial and other forms of anti-Semitism often go hand-in-hand with homophobia, xenophobia, racism, other hatred.  It’s also a rallying cry for those who seek to tear down our democracies, which we’ve seen in both our countries is often a precursor to violence.</p>
<p>That’s why we have to find innovative ways to bring the history of the Holocaust to life not only to understand the past, but also to guide our present and to shape our future.</p>
<p>Together with the United States Holocaust Museum – Memorial Museum and the German Foundation for the Murdered Jews of Europe, our governments will strengthen Holocaust education.  We’ll counter Holocaust denial and distortion.  We’ll ensure that public servants, teachers, young people like the young leaders here today understand these issues in depth and feel a responsibility to stop atrocities wherever they occur.</p>
<p>We will build on decades of serious, remarkable work by Germany to grapple with the darkest past of its history, to honor all the victims of the Holocaust, to combat anti-Semitism, to foster a culture of remembrance here and around the world, including through leadership in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.  This work has become a defining part of our transatlantic relationship and of shoring up our democracies.</p>
<p>For just as dissent is incremental, so is the work of building up principles and practices that can make real the promise of “Never again,” like the steady march ascending from the depths of this memorial.</p>
<p>My late stepfather Samuel Pisar was 12 years old when the Nazis invaded his home of Bialystok, Poland.  A week later, they lined up hundreds of Jewish men and boys, including his cousins Isaac, Grisha, Frol, and mowed them down.</p>
<p>Days later, he and his family were forced to move to Bialystok’s newly walled-off ghetto.  His father David was disappeared first, then his uncle, and then his grandmother, and then he was separated from his mother Helaina, his little sister Freida, and sent to Treblinka, later to Majdanek, to Auschwitz, to Dachau.</p>
<p>When he was liberated by American soldiers in 1945, he was the only surviving member of his family.</p>
<p>During the Holocaust, ghettos like the one in Bialoystok were in the heart of cities just like this memorial.  That meant that beyond the Nazis, everyone in those cities knew that Jews lived there.  They knew the trains were leaving, packed with people day after day.  The evil was visible, but most chose to look away, to do nothing.</p>
<p>This dialogue will help us remember all that can be lost, but also help us to see all that we can save if we choose – if we choose to stand up rather than stand by.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  Thank you very much, Excellency, for these (inaudible) words.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) The German foreign minister now has the floor.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Survivors, ladies and gentlemen, my relationship with this nation’s poignant, painful, and powerful history is hazy.  I will never forget how much I loved the medieval city of Nuremburg, a city that was also the birthplace of the horrifying Nazi racial laws.  I cried privately at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, and I rejoiced after the fact in Germany’s World Cup victory.</p>
<p>The U.S. student Avi Colonomos wrote these words in 2014 when he was 20 years old.  He had come to Berlin with a transatlantic program, Germany Close Up, along with other young Jewish people to learn more about today’s Germany.  What Avi Colonomos describes is the inner conflict that goes hand-in-hand with remembrance.  We are conflicted between tears and joy, conflicted in the face of this history that pains and divides us, just as it moves and unites us in our shared humanity.  And yet understanding where we come from is, despite the sins of inner conflict, the best compass to determine which direction we want to go in.  To borrow the words  of James Baldwin writing in <em>The New York Times</em> in 1962, and I quote, “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”</p>
<p>The 2,710 concrete stelae that make up the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe behind me show us where we Germans come from and what we are responsible for.  The history of murder, horror, and suffering inflicted upon millions of people, incomparable, incontrovertible in its manmade monstrosity here between these stelae, created by the great U.S. architect Peter Eisenman, feelings of profound unease, solitude, grief, responsibility become almost palpable.  Yes, remembrance can be painful.  Yes, remembrance is a test of our mettle and it has to be painful.</p>
<p>And yet we stand here today, side by side, Americans and Germans, Jews, Muslims, Christians and Atheists united in shared remembrance, united by our belief in values such as freedom, democracy, and tolerance, united too in our determination to build a better future on this foundation of values.  That is what Europe is based on and that is what our transatlantic friendship is based on.</p>
<p>Dear Tony, I know how much your family’s personal experiences of the Holocaust influence what you do every day.  You’ve just shared this with us.  On your first day in office as Secretary of State, you said, and I quote, “I remember that the nation’s power isn’t measured only by the size of its military and economy, but by the moral choices it makes,” end of quote.  And the field of stelae behind us is proof of this statement cast in concrete.  America’s power, Germany’s and Europe’s power does not come from glorifying history or glossing over the wrong turns of the past, of which none led into such a terrible abyss as did the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Our strength lies in accepting the burden of historical responsibility unconditionally without drawing a final line.  Our strength lies in joining forces as we search for the best path forward and to do so together, ideally.</p>
<p>And so I am delighted, Dear Tony, that we’re here today in this unique place in the country of the perpetrators to launch a dialogue on Holocaust issues between the United States and Germany.  One of our most pressing tasks will be to prepare our culture of remembrance for changing times.  The memorial foundation with its director, Dr. Uwe Neumarker and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum do outstanding work here every day.  The American Jewish Committee and its director David Harris as well as the Leo Baeck Institute with William Weitzer are also working with us for a lively culture of remembrance.</p>
<p>And I’m grateful for these approaches for their work because I believe that future generations will no longer be able to benefit from personal encounters with contemporary witnesses.  What a great loss.  But at the same time, what a great undertaking for us to find new forms of remembrance which do not allow the stories of individuals to fade from our consciousness.  We owe this to the victims and the survivors, and we’re delighted and honored – dear Margot Friedlander; Mr. Gardosch, dear Peter; and Franz Michalski – that you are with us today.  And we owe it to our children and grandchildren who we want to prevent as far as we can from repeating the errors of the past.</p>
<p>In recent years, we have seen anti-Semitism and racism eating into our societies on both sides of the Atlantic.  Just think of the yellow star badges seen at demonstrations against COVID measures, of the torrent of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on the internet, of the attacks on synagogues and on Jewish people living in our countries, of the rioters in front of the Bundestag, or the rampaging mob in the U.S. Capitol.  The U.S. philosopher, Susan Neiman, president of the Einstein Forum in Potsdam and one of the wisest transatlantic voices in this country gave us a piece of advice some years ago that I believe to be very sage, namely that we must refuse to give evil – and racism and anti-Semitism are nothing other than that – any justification and any weight.  Only through this refusal and not through inaction, silence, or relativization can we subdue the forces that seek to divide our societies.</p>
<p>What we are doing here today will help.  Of course, remembrance is no panacea.  People in societies cannot make peace with their past as easily as that.  It remains a test, a source of inner conflict.  But sharing in remembrance with friends, as we are doing here today, unites us as we face up to this conflict.  And it strengthens us, and above all it strengthens our societies for the future.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>SAUERBREY:</strong>(Via interpreter) Thank you, Minister.  We now turn to the signing of the letter of intent.</li>
</ol>
<p>(The letter of intent is signed.)</p>
<p>And we have two more people to address us now.  First Ms. Margot Friedlander.  She was born in Berlin.  She survived the Holocaust in a number of hiding places until being deported in 1944 to Theresienstadt.  Her father, her mother, her brother, and many other relatives of her were murdered.  Margot Friedlander immigrated to the United States with her husband in 1946 and in 2010 she returned permanently to Berlin.  Ms. Friedlander, thank you for addressing us today.</p>
<p><strong>MS FRIEDLANDER:  </strong>I will tell you a little bit of my experiences.  In mid-January 1943, at about 2:00 p.m., I was on my way home from the factory where I was working (inaudible).  When I approached the house, I noticed a man entering the house.  I did not know him.  Is he waiting for someone?  To be careful, I covered my Jewish star before I was leaving – our apartment door was – happened for him, it is waiting.  I pass him coolly, walk up another floor, and ring the bell of Christian neighbors.  I hardly knew, hoping that they will be home.</p>
<p>I hear steps.  The doors open and the neighbors asked me quietly into the house.  On her face, I see stress, and I feel right away that something has happened.  She asked me into her living room; we both sit down, and she’s – she is telling me time, a few hours ago, she heard noise at the house.  “Open up,” banging on the door, then the clatter at the stairway, and she went to the window.  She saw them come out and rudely pushed them into the police car.  “Whom?” do I ask the neighbor.  “Some people I did not know?”  “The lady, Mrs. Meissner, who also lives in the apartment, and a boy.”</p>
<p>“My brother, Ralph; my mother?”  She tells me my mother was not there.  But one hour after she came home, she found the door locked and (inaudible).  I told her all –  “Where is she now?”  My mother was not waiting for me.  But she left a message with neighbors.  “Tell my daughter, if you should see her, I am going to the police.  I’m going with Ralph, wherever that will be.  Try to make your life.”  With her words, in my mind, I was able to find help and went underground into hiding.</p>
<p>German gentile people I have never seen before, humans, people with character and courage, helped me, who did not look away, but to do something that could have cost their head.  For 15 months, I was hiding with different people.  But in April 1944, my look – my luck ran out.  I was snitched and saw some good fortune.  I was deported to Theresienstadt, where again I was lucky to be able to work in a factory producing the splitting of glimmer that was needed for war effort.  That probably saved me from deportation from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz.  That was the fate of hundred thousands.</p>
<p>In early February 1945, a transport arrived, and with it came Adolf Friedlander.  They came from a special work arrangement near Frankfurt/Oder and because the Russians came closer, they were sent back to Theresienstadt.  I knew Adolf Friedlander years ago in Berlin.  It was so good to meet someone you had known in past life.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) I’ve lost track of where I am, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>(In English) Together, we experience the arrival of a transport in late February, about 10 days before liberation.  I got the assignment to help at the arrival of the train.  As the cattle car door was opened, the people, who were no more human – the masses fell out and were pushed out.  Many were already dead.  Men only, but indistinguishable looking – in striped-looking things like pajamas, but were already tatters.  They wear before Auschwitz was liberated on January 27, 1945, put on the death march for weeks, and the left ones, humans, were put on the cattle cars that now arrived in Theresienstadt, the one camp not liberated at the time.  At the moment I was seeing the masses, I realized I will not ever see my mother and brother again.</p>
<p>Adolf and I experienced the liberation together on the 8th of May, 1945, as, at first, the people who treated us as – left.  The Swiss International Cross came and the Red Cross flag was flying instead of the <em>Hakenkreuz</em>.  About 10 days later, they handed Theresienstadt over to the Russians.  That was on the 8th of May.</p>
<p>Weeks later, sitting on a bench talking to Adolf, he asked me if I could think of starting a life together with him in America, where his sister was living.  We got married on the 28th of June in Theresienstadt, just a day before the last rabbi left Theresienstadt.  One day after our marriage, a cable from his sister arrived, telling him how happy she is that he is alive and expect him in USA.</p>
<p>We left Theresienstadt in early July 1945 and spent one year in a DP camp in Germany before we could leave.  We arrived in July 28th in America.  My husband passed away in December 1997, after almost 53 years of a very special marriage.  We both had the same experience.  We both knew how very special life is.</p>
<p>A few months after my husband had passed away, I was asked to join the senior club of the 92nd Street Y, where my husband was in a leading position for 28 years.  There, many courses were offered, and after more than two years, a writing course started.  I was asked to join.  I was hesitant, but I did.  One night after sleep did not come, the memories, the many memories – I took paper and pen into the bed and started at last to tell my story.</p>
<p>For more than one year, for every course, I did tell the class one more experience, realizing right at the first meeting how very little they knew of these years, almost into my unimaginable happenings what was taking place under the Nazi regime, what humans did, (inaudible).</p>
<p>After living for 57 years in USA, I went for the first time in 2003 to Berlin where I was born and for a visit, and the possibility of planning to make a film, a documentary.  A filmmaker had heard about my story.  He did.  The film was shown in 2005 in Berlin at Jewish Film Festival.  After that, my life took a different turn, because I was asked to write something in German. Always thinking that for 70 years, I live with the messages my mother left for me, “Try to make your life,” I started to write my book.  It was published in Germany by Rowohlt.  It came out in (inaudible) with the title of the words my mother left for me, <em>Try To Make Your Life</em>.  In German, <em>Versuche, dein Leben zu machen</em>.</p>
<p>Right now, I came very often to Berlin because right at the start, I was asked to give readings in schools, bookstores, but many different places.  I talked – well, in cities in Germany, always finding that the students are most attentive, interested to talk to me, to ask questions, and want to know more about what my life is now after much (inaudible) experiences.  In 2009, I got surprise in German for the book as the best autobiography.  In July of 2009, I came to Berlin and stayed for seven months, having such wonderful experiences, meeting fine people.</p>
<p>People thank me for doing what now became my mission.  I often give two or three readings a week, again traveling to many cities.  I was reading always for one hour very special pages from the book, and telling to whom I spoke what I want them to do, what I do, because we will not be on with a life many – much longer, and it is for them that it should never happen again, that I don’t want anyone to experience what has been done to the 5 million Jews and millions of other innocent humans.</p>
<p>I tell them that there is no Christian, Jewish, or Muslim blood – that there’s only human blood.  We are all the same, that people did it because they did not respect humans.  Please, be a human being.</p>
<p>In 2010 I did return to Berlin for good, and never did I regret it for one moment.  And here I am and gold still – it’s now almost hundred years to talk to people.  It is for you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Thank you, Ms. Friedlander, for your words, for everything you have done for Holocaust remembrance and for everything you continue to do.  Margo Wieseler, 25 years old, will speak to us now.  She served as a volunteer at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center in Chicago, Illinois, Skokie.</p>
<p><strong>MS WIESELER:</strong>  Good morning.  Again, I would just really like to thank Ms. Friedlander.  Your words really shook me in a way I didn’t even expect, although I expected it to be emotional, but yeah.  So thank you very much, and your words of wisdom and passion are truly an inspiring call to action for my generation.</p>
<p>I also want to thank Secretary Blinken and Secretary Maas for highlighting innovative ways to commemorate the Holocaust.  Initiatives to preserve the voices of our survivors are essential to prevent my generation from choosing the ease of forgetting over the pain or the shame of remembering.  And sometimes standard high-school-level history education can sadly reinforce this tendency, as it can make the Holocaust feel unpersonal and much more distant than it is.</p>
<p>I myself only recently really started confronting my family history and involvement when I began to prepare for my year abroad with <em>Aktion Suhnezeichen Friedensdienste</em>.  <em>Aktion Suhnezeichen</em> is a German NGO aiding reconciliation between victims of Nazi persecution and young Germans today.  And with the help of them, I had the unique opportunity and great privilege to spend a year volunteering at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center, a world-leading institution in the field of digitalized Holocaust remembrance in Chicago.</p>
<p>So – and I did find my motivation for serving in the museum in my family history.  My great grandfather was a member of the Reichstag, appointed by the Nazi party.  I was, still am, and will always be ashamed of this piece of my family’s history, and I was especially anxious to share this with the survivors and their families.  They had every reason to be dismissive, hurt, or even hostile towards me, but to my great relief their response was full of love, understanding, and even curiosity towards me and my motivations.</p>
<p>This ability to distinguish between my generation and our ancestors left a lasting impression on me.  I was especially amazed by Fritzie Fritzshall, the museum’s longtime president and a teenage survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau, who heavily accepted an invitation to dinner from me and a friend.  And the cuisine would be German, obviously.</p>
<p>In devastating news, Fritzie sadly died last weekend, leaving another hole that will never be filled.  However, her impressing ability to disband black-and-white thinking in place of a more nuanced approach is, I think, something I learned from and everybody else can do.</p>
<p>My generation, young as we are, has been fortunate enough to hear the stories of the Holocaust directly from survivors, reminding us just how recent these atrocities truly were.  Because they were – they did happen before our lifetimes.  With each passing day, preserving and retelling these lessons gets more important, lest we begin to distance ourselves and forget the lessons learned.</p>
<p>My year with <em>Aktion Suhnezeichen </em>has forever changed me, and I can confidently say that I understand the importance of combating anti-Semitism and using that voice to fight for a free and fair society better than before.  If young people like me sincerely want to make “Never again” or “<em>Nie wieder</em>” a reality, we must never stop openly building bridges between the most painful hours of the past, our lives today, and the future we wish to see.</p>
<p>Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Thank you, Ms. Wieseler.  Ladies and gentlemen, the foreign ministers will now place a wreath on the Memorial to the Murdered Jews in Europe, and will then speak to the survivors who are with us today: Ms. Margot Friedlander, Peter Gardosch, and Franz Michalski.  Ms. Wieseler and a number of Anne Frank ambassadors are also here, peer guides and volunteers of the Anne Frank Center in Berlin.  Afterwards, this ceremony is concluded.  And I would like to use this opportunity to thank you on behalf of the foreign office and the U.S. Department of State for having come here.  Have a safe journey home.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

<p>And yet we stand here today, side by side, Americans and Germans, Jews, Muslims, Christians and Atheists united in shared remembrance, united by our belief in values such as freedom, democracy, and tolerance, united too in our determination to build a better future on this foundation of values.  That is what Europe is based on and that is what our transatlantic friendship is based on.</p>
<p>Dear Tony, I know how much your family’s personal experiences of the Holocaust influence what you do every day.  You’ve just shared this with us.  On your first day in office as Secretary of State, you said, and I quote, “I remember that the nation’s power isn’t measured only by the size of its military and economy, but by the moral choices it makes,” end of quote.  And the field of stelae behind us is proof of this statement cast in concrete.  America’s power, Germany’s and Europe’s power does not come from glorifying history or glossing over the wrong turns of the past, of which none led into such a terrible abyss as did the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Our strength lies in accepting the burden of historical responsibility unconditionally without drawing a final line.  Our strength lies in joining forces as we search for the best path forward and to do so together, ideally.</p>
<p>And so I am delighted, Dear Tony, that we’re here today in this unique place in the country of the perpetrators to launch a dialogue on Holocaust issues between the United States and Germany.  One of our most pressing tasks will be to prepare our culture of remembrance for changing times.  The memorial foundation with its director, Dr. Uwe Neumarker and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum do outstanding work here every day.  The American Jewish Committee and its director David Harris as well as the Leo Baeck Institute with William Weitzer are also working with us for a lively culture of remembrance.</p>
<p>And I’m grateful for these approaches for their work because I believe that future generations will no longer be able to benefit from personal encounters with contemporary witnesses.  What a great loss.  But at the same time, what a great undertaking for us to find new forms of remembrance which do not allow the stories of individuals to fade from our consciousness.  We owe this to the victims and the survivors, and we’re delighted and honored – dear Margot Friedlander; Mr. Gardosch, dear Peter; and Franz Michalski – that you are with us today.  And we owe it to our children and grandchildren who we want to prevent as far as we can from repeating the errors of the past.</p>
<p>In recent years, we have seen anti-Semitism and racism eating into our societies on both sides of the Atlantic.  Just think of the yellow star badges seen at demonstrations against COVID measures, of the torrent of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on the internet, of the attacks on synagogues and on Jewish people living in our countries, of the rioters in front of the Bundestag, or the rampaging mob in the U.S. Capitol.  The U.S. philosopher, Susan Neiman, president of the Einstein Forum in Potsdam and one of the wisest transatlantic voices in this country gave us a piece of advice some years ago that I believe to be very sage, namely that we must refuse to give evil – and racism and anti-Semitism are nothing other than that – any justification and any weight.  Only through this refusal and not through inaction, silence, or relativization can we subdue the forces that seek to divide our societies.</p>
<p>What we are doing here today will help.  Of course, remembrance is no panacea.  People in societies cannot make peace with their past as easily as that.  It remains a test, a source of inner conflict.  But sharing in remembrance with friends, as we are doing here today, unites us as we face up to this conflict.  And it strengthens us, and above all it strengthens our societies for the future.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>SAUERBREY:</strong>(Via interpreter) Thank you, Minister.  We now turn to the signing of the letter of intent.</li>
</ol>
<p>(The letter of intent is signed.)</p>
<p>And we have two more people to address us now.  First Ms. Margot Friedlander.  She was born in Berlin.  She survived the Holocaust in a number of hiding places until being deported in 1944 to Theresienstadt.  Her father, her mother, her brother, and many other relatives of her were murdered.  Margot Friedlander immigrated to the United States with her husband in 1946 and in 2010 she returned permanently to Berlin.  Ms. Friedlander, thank you for addressing us today.</p>
<p><strong>MS FRIEDLANDER:  </strong>I will tell you a little bit of my experiences.  In mid-January 1943, at about 2:00 p.m., I was on my way home from the factory where I was working (inaudible).  When I approached the house, I noticed a man entering the house.  I did not know him.  Is he waiting for someone?  To be careful, I covered my Jewish star before I was leaving – our apartment door was – happened for him, it is waiting.  I pass him coolly, walk up another floor, and ring the bell of Christian neighbors.  I hardly knew, hoping that they will be home.</p>
<p>I hear steps.  The doors open and the neighbors asked me quietly into the house.  On her face, I see stress, and I feel right away that something has happened.  She asked me into her living room; we both sit down, and she’s – she is telling me time, a few hours ago, she heard noise at the house.  “Open up,” banging on the door, then the clatter at the stairway, and she went to the window.  She saw them come out and rudely pushed them into the police car.  “Whom?” do I ask the neighbor.  “Some people I did not know?”  “The lady, Mrs. Meissner, who also lives in the apartment, and a boy.”</p>
<p>“My brother, Ralph; my mother?”  She tells me my mother was not there.  But one hour after she came home, she found the door locked and (inaudible).  I told her all –  “Where is she now?”  My mother was not waiting for me.  But she left a message with neighbors.  “Tell my daughter, if you should see her, I am going to the police.  I’m going with Ralph, wherever that will be.  Try to make your life.”  With her words, in my mind, I was able to find help and went underground into hiding.</p>
<p>German gentile people I have never seen before, humans, people with character and courage, helped me, who did not look away, but to do something that could have cost their head.  For 15 months, I was hiding with different people.  But in April 1944, my look – my luck ran out.  I was snitched and saw some good fortune.  I was deported to Theresienstadt, where again I was lucky to be able to work in a factory producing the splitting of glimmer that was needed for war effort.  That probably saved me from deportation from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz.  That was the fate of hundred thousands.</p>
<p>In early February 1945, a transport arrived, and with it came Adolf Friedlander.  They came from a special work arrangement near Frankfurt/Oder and because the Russians came closer, they were sent back to Theresienstadt.  I knew Adolf Friedlander years ago in Berlin.  It was so good to meet someone you had known in past life.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) I’ve lost track of where I am, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>(In English) Together, we experience the arrival of a transport in late February, about 10 days before liberation.  I got the assignment to help at the arrival of the train.  As the cattle car door was opened, the people, who were no more human – the masses fell out and were pushed out.  Many were already dead.  Men only, but indistinguishable looking – in striped-looking things like pajamas, but were already tatters.  They wear before Auschwitz was liberated on January 27, 1945, put on the death march for weeks, and the left ones, humans, were put on the cattle cars that now arrived in Theresienstadt, the one camp not liberated at the time.  At the moment I was seeing the masses, I realized I will not ever see my mother and brother again.</p>
<p>Adolf and I experienced the liberation together on the 8th of May, 1945, as, at first, the people who treated us as – left.  The Swiss International Cross came and the Red Cross flag was flying instead of the <em>Hakenkreuz</em>.  About 10 days later, they handed Theresienstadt over to the Russians.  That was on the 8th of May.</p>
<p>Weeks later, sitting on a bench talking to Adolf, he asked me if I could think of starting a life together with him in America, where his sister was living.  We got married on the 28th of June in Theresienstadt, just a day before the last rabbi left Theresienstadt.  One day after our marriage, a cable from his sister arrived, telling him how happy she is that he is alive and expect him in USA.</p>
<p>We left Theresienstadt in early July 1945 and spent one year in a DP camp in Germany before we could leave.  We arrived in July 28th in America.  My husband passed away in December 1997, after almost 53 years of a very special marriage.  We both had the same experience.  We both knew how very special life is.</p>
<p>A few months after my husband had passed away, I was asked to join the senior club of the 92nd Street Y, where my husband was in a leading position for 28 years.  There, many courses were offered, and after more than two years, a writing course started.  I was asked to join.  I was hesitant, but I did.  One night after sleep did not come, the memories, the many memories – I took paper and pen into the bed and started at last to tell my story.</p>
<p>For more than one year, for every course, I did tell the class one more experience, realizing right at the first meeting how very little they knew of these years, almost into my unimaginable happenings what was taking place under the Nazi regime, what humans did, (inaudible).</p>
<p>After living for 57 years in USA, I went for the first time in 2003 to Berlin where I was born and for a visit, and the possibility of planning to make a film, a documentary.  A filmmaker had heard about my story.  He did.  The film was shown in 2005 in Berlin at Jewish Film Festival.  After that, my life took a different turn, because I was asked to write something in German. Always thinking that for 70 years, I live with the messages my mother left for me, “Try to make your life,” I started to write my book.  It was published in Germany by Rowohlt.  It came out in (inaudible) with the title of the words my mother left for me, <em>Try To Make Your Life</em>.  In German, <em>Versuche, dein Leben zu machen</em>.</p>
<p>Right now, I came very often to Berlin because right at the start, I was asked to give readings in schools, bookstores, but many different places.  I talked – well, in cities in Germany, always finding that the students are most attentive, interested to talk to me, to ask questions, and want to know more about what my life is now after much (inaudible) experiences.  In 2009, I got surprise in German for the book as the best autobiography.  In July of 2009, I came to Berlin and stayed for seven months, having such wonderful experiences, meeting fine people.</p>
<p>People thank me for doing what now became my mission.  I often give two or three readings a week, again traveling to many cities.  I was reading always for one hour very special pages from the book, and telling to whom I spoke what I want them to do, what I do, because we will not be on with a life many – much longer, and it is for them that it should never happen again, that I don’t want anyone to experience what has been done to the 5 million Jews and millions of other innocent humans.</p>
<p>I tell them that there is no Christian, Jewish, or Muslim blood – that there’s only human blood.  We are all the same, that people did it because they did not respect humans.  Please, be a human being.</p>
<p>In 2010 I did return to Berlin for good, and never did I regret it for one moment.  And here I am and gold still – it’s now almost hundred years to talk to people.  It is for you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Thank you, Ms. Friedlander, for your words, for everything you have done for Holocaust remembrance and for everything you continue to do.  Margo Wieseler, 25 years old, will speak to us now.  She served as a volunteer at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center in Chicago, Illinois, Skokie.</p>
<p><strong>MS WIESELER:</strong>  Good morning.  Again, I would just really like to thank Ms. Friedlander.  Your words really shook me in a way I didn’t even expect, although I expected it to be emotional, but yeah.  So thank you very much, and your words of wisdom and passion are truly an inspiring call to action for my generation.</p>
<p>I also want to thank Secretary Blinken and Secretary Maas for highlighting innovative ways to commemorate the Holocaust.  Initiatives to preserve the voices of our survivors are essential to prevent my generation from choosing the ease of forgetting over the pain or the shame of remembering.  And sometimes standard high-school-level history education can sadly reinforce this tendency, as it can make the Holocaust feel unpersonal and much more distant than it is.</p>
<p>I myself only recently really started confronting my family history and involvement when I began to prepare for my year abroad with <em>Aktion Suhnezeichen Friedensdienste</em>.  <em>Aktion Suhnezeichen</em> is a German NGO aiding reconciliation between victims of Nazi persecution and young Germans today.  And with the help of them, I had the unique opportunity and great privilege to spend a year volunteering at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center, a world-leading institution in the field of digitalized Holocaust remembrance in Chicago.</p>
<p>So – and I did find my motivation for serving in the museum in my family history.  My great grandfather was a member of the Reichstag, appointed by the Nazi party.  I was, still am, and will always be ashamed of this piece of my family’s history, and I was especially anxious to share this with the survivors and their families.  They had every reason to be dismissive, hurt, or even hostile towards me, but to my great relief their response was full of love, understanding, and even curiosity towards me and my motivations.</p>
<p>This ability to distinguish between my generation and our ancestors left a lasting impression on me.  I was especially amazed by Fritzie Fritzshall, the museum’s longtime president and a teenage survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau, who heavily accepted an invitation to dinner from me and a friend.  And the cuisine would be German, obviously.</p>
<p>In devastating news, Fritzie sadly died last weekend, leaving another hole that will never be filled.  However, her impressing ability to disband black-and-white thinking in place of a more nuanced approach is, I think, something I learned from and everybody else can do.</p>
<p>My generation, young as we are, has been fortunate enough to hear the stories of the Holocaust directly from survivors, reminding us just how recent these atrocities truly were.  Because they were – they did happen before our lifetimes.  With each passing day, preserving and retelling these lessons gets more important, lest we begin to distance ourselves and forget the lessons learned.</p>
<p>My year with <em>Aktion Suhnezeichen </em>has forever changed me, and I can confidently say that I understand the importance of combating anti-Semitism and using that voice to fight for a free and fair society better than before.  If young people like me sincerely want to make “Never again” or “<em>Nie wieder</em>” a reality, we must never stop openly building bridges between the most painful hours of the past, our lives today, and the future we wish to see.</p>
<p>Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Thank you, Ms. Wieseler.  Ladies and gentlemen, the foreign ministers will now place a wreath on the Memorial to the Murdered Jews in Europe, and will then speak to the survivors who are with us today: Ms. Margot Friedlander, Peter Gardosch, and Franz Michalski.  Ms. Wieseler and a number of Anne Frank ambassadors are also here, peer guides and volunteers of the Anne Frank Center in Berlin.  Afterwards, this ceremony is concluded.  And I would like to use this opportunity to thank you on behalf of the foreign office and the U.S. Department of State for having come here.  Have a safe journey home.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

<p><em>“President Macron and I stand together, ready to take on the toughest challenges we face.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><em>– President Biden, June 11, 2021</em></p>
<p>Secretary Antony J. Blinken will travel to Paris, France, June 24-27, 2021, where he will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and French Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian.  During this trip to engage with the United States’ oldest Ally, Secretary Blinken will emphasize the importance of maintaining Transatlantic cooperation, addressing our joint response to the ongoing health crisis, tackling the climate crisis, and highlighting the strength of our longstanding bilateral partnership.</p>
<p><strong>The United States and France are Close Allies</strong></p>
<p>France is America’s oldest friend and Ally.  Our relationship is built upon our shared commitment to the same values – democracy, human rights, the rule of law, security, and prosperity.  The closeness of our military, economic, and political cooperation form the basis of our enduring partnership.</p>
<p>The United States has counted on France as a close partner since the very foundation of our country.  We remember Gilbert du Mortier, Marquis de Lafayette, and Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, Comte de Rochambeau, as heroes of the American Revolution.  France came to the aid of our young country; the United States has not forgotten.</p>
<p>In 2021, we commemorated the 77th anniversary of D-Day and the sacrifices made on the beaches of Normandy.  As NATO Allies, France and the United States have built and sustained the post-war global order, which promotes freedom and prosperity.  Our joint commitment to shared Transatlantic values has brought us 77 years of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p><strong>Confronting Global Challenges: The United States Counts on France as a Partner</strong></p>
<p>Today’s global challenges underscore the importance of strong partnerships.  Security, economic, and cultural cooperation form the basis of our bilateral relationship.  France is a key NATO Ally and an important bilateral economic partner.  France will assume the presidency of the Council of the European Union in January 2022, and we look forward to working with France to revitalize and raise the level of ambition in the United States’ partnership with the EU.</p>
<p>Security cooperation underpins our bilateral relationship.  France remains a steadfast partner in the fight against terrorism, as both a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and through its counterterrorism leadership in the Sahel.  Around the world, we look to France as a partner in global security.</p>
<p>The United States and France agree on the need to hold Russia accountable for its aggressive and destabilizing activities, including in Ukraine.  France is a partner in standing up to Russia’s attempts to undermine democratic systems.</p>
<p>We coordinate with France on issues like human rights, economic coercion, and corruption, to amplify our voices and combat the PRC’s attempts to erode the values and institutions that undergird the rules-based international order.</p>
<p>The United States is dedicated to raising global climate ambitions. In the lead up to COP26, we will continue to work with France in implementing climate finance to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century.</p>
<p><strong>The Thriving Bilateral Economic Relationship Supports Our Workers</strong></p>
<p>The United States and France share a deep trade and investment relationship.  France is the United States’ third largest trading partner in Europe with $99.7 billion of goods and services traded in 2020.  The United States is the top destination for French investment and the United States is the largest foreign investor in France.  In total, we have invested more than $394 billion in each other&#8217;s economies.  The 4,800 French firms in the United States support 780,000 jobs, while the 4,500 U.S. firms in France support nearly 500,000 jobs.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the United States and France share concerns about the health of our citizens as we seek to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and ensure equitable access to vaccines.  The United States and France have both committed to share vaccine doses through COVAX and will continue to support global vaccination efforts.  We must work together to safely restore global travel and trade on a sustainable basis, and the United States looks forward to partnering with France to increase global preparedness to better prevent and respond to future outbreaks.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Historical and Cultural Ties Cement Our People-to-People Bonds </strong></p>
<p>The enduring relationship between our two countries is apparent in our historical connection and people-to-people ties.  France and the United States share a strong commitment to educational exchanges.  Before the coronavirus pandemic, approximately18,000 Americans studied abroad in France each year, making France among the top four most popular study abroad destinations for American students.  French students are also attracted to educational exchange opportunities in the United States.  In the 2019/2020 academic year, 8,471 French students chose to study at a U.S. college or university.   Although COVID-19 has forced many of our exchange programs to pause this year, interest in exchanges remains strong, and we will make every effort to ensure that these exchanges between our two countries not only continue but grow.</p>
<p>Established in 1948, the U.S.-French Fulbright program is one of the oldest Fulbright programs in the world.  Every year, approximately 160 French and American students, scholars, teaching assistants, and higher education administrators receive Fulbright awards to study, teach, and conduct research.  Since its inception, the program has supported approximately 30,000 individual Fulbright exchanges between the United States and France and will celebrate its 75th anniversary in 2023.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>I would like to congratulate law professor Gay McDougall on her election as an independent expert to serve on the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).  Advancing racial equity and justice is a top priority for the United States, and in our pursuit of those ideals at home and around the world, the United States was proud to nominate her to serve a third term on the Committee.</p>
<p>The Committee is an important UN platform for addressing global systemic racism.  It is charged with the critical work of monitoring 182 States parties’ compliance with their treaty obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).  The United States takes our ICERD treaty obligations seriously and submitted our outstanding reports to the CERD Committee on June 2.</p>
<p>Professor McDougall is a globally acclaimed expert in international human rights law, a Fordham University law professor, and will serve as a principled and independent voice on the Committee.  She has successfully served on this Committee in the past, and I am confident she will continue to bring the important perspective of American jurisprudence towards the goal of eliminating global and systemic racism.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany </p>
<p>Clärchens Ballhaus</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Welcome, everyone, for our session today on the transatlantic relations.  I’m very happy that Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Maas could join us today.</p>
<p>Again, in German.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) So first of all, I’d like to say, first of all, thank you and a very, very warm welcome to all of you.  I’m so happy that first, Foreign Minister Maas, and also Secretary of State Blinken are here.  It’s great that we have the opportunity to speak with them.  I’d like to give them the chance to speak.</p>
<p>Mr. Minister Maas, you have three minutes for brief remarks for – on German foreign policy and transatlantic relations.  Three minutes, they belong to you, and then we will pass the baton onto Secretary of State Blinken.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter) A word of welcome also on my behalf.  We are delighted to have the opportunity to not only talk to those people we tend to meet regularly – ministers, politicians – but to meet with people like you.  We are dying to hear your questions.  Please be courageous.  We are willing to take any questions you might have.  I really enjoy something like this, especially as the perspective of us being given a glass of beer is there visible on the horizon.  Why are you giving me a large one?  (Laughter.)  Bad news, bad press coverage.  And that this takes place in a location like this – those who know Berlin know Clarchens Ballhaus, and I am pleased that Tony accepted to have this here.  This is not the classical Berlin style.</p>
<p>So as I said, we look forward to having your questions.  And I don’t want to be too long.  I’ll just share a story with you, if I may, Tony.  From the very first telephone conversation we had after Tony took the office of Secretary of State, at the end of the telephone call I couldn’t help myself by saying Tony, I still have to get used to the fact that I can speak to the American Foreign Secretary and always be of the same view because that used to be different beforehand.</p>
<p>This is important for the bilateral relationship between Germany and the United States.  The election of Joe Biden is a genuine game-changer for international politics, the biggest for quite a while – for many years indeed as long as I have been following events in the field of foreign policy because you once said diplomacy is back, and I think the President also said that diplomacy is back, the United States are back on the international stage.  And that is really something that we missed for quite a while – transatlantic partnership, yes, indeed.</p>
<p>I think we have to have the same objectives, and that has improved as far as that situation is concerned.  And I think this is to do with the fact that we are linked by the same values.  We share the same values: democracy, freedom, rule of law.  And I believe that that is what the vast majority of the people on this globe actually wants to have as the foundation of their lives, and that is what links us.  I think that is what brings us together and what we have in common, Europe and North America.  And the times we are experiencing is the place to be.</p>
<p>Okay, let me give you one example, a somewhat problematic one.  When we look to the flows of migration we are confronted with, the people who want to come to Europe, why do they want to come to Europe?  I know about few people – migrants who are heading in the direction of China or Moscow.  They’re coming to us.  And the same is true for the United States when you look to Latin America – South America – they are heading in your direction, your way, and towards Canada.  And that is a clear indication of the fact that this is what the people are looking for: democracy, liberal societies, freedoms, and respect for the rights of minorities too.  These are the values that we share.</p>
<p>And if you share that set of values, it’s not that difficult also to define the same objectives.  And it is now about how we can cooperate in order to achieve these objectives.  And we are cooperating.  In the past, this hasn’t been the case often enough when you look to Russia and to China.  We won’t be able to achieve as much as we would if the United States and Europe were to pursue the same strategy; we would be playing in the same camp, so to speak.  And that is or has become obvious over the last few months – the same objectives, the same set of values.</p>
<p>And every – whenever this cooperation takes place, G7, G20, we are heading for a G20 ministerial meeting at the end of – at the beginning of next week – we’ll have to unite our forces in order to protect what is important to us, the values that – our foundation and our political sphere, but also those that we want to have as a foundation for our everyday life.  They need to be protected and to be upheld day in, day out.  And if that is possible, I think then it should be possible also to make sure that they are upheld in other parts of the world too.</p>
<p>So as I said, I’m delighted that we’re back here.  We need the United States.  And yeah, I want to be quite open because it sounds so political what I’ve been saying so far.  It’s more fun too.  I’m being very honest.  We had President Trump, then we had the virus.  It has made matters extremely complicated.  I now hope that we will overcome the virus too.  We have so many things in common.  And I think there is such a great degree of readiness and willingness on both sides of the Atlantic to cooperate.  So I look forward to that.</p>
<p>Minister, thank you very much indeed.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Welcome to Berlin, the transatlantic relations and the focus today.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, first, it’s wonderful to be with all of you.  And I’ve got to say, Heiko, as much as I love the foreign ministry and as much as the chancellor’s office is extraordinary, this is a pretty good place to have a conversation.  And I asked for the smaller one.  They were going to give me a larger one, but cheers, first of all.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  A couple of things.  First of all, it’s wonderful to see all of you, and I’m really looking forward to hearing from you and talking to you.  I have a deep personal affection for Germany that goes back many years.  I had the great experience and good fortune after being born in New York and living in New York until I was nine years old and moving when I was nine to Paris, and my closest friends in school in Paris were both, as it turned out, German – both when I first got there when I was nine, ten years old, and then later another good friend who was my closest friend through high school.  And we were in a band together.  He was actually talented, unlike me.  (Laughter.)  But we – one spring break we took a road trip, and we drove from Paris to Hamburg, and we – maybe we thought we were going to be like the Beatles when they spent time in Hamburg and then they got famous afterward.  That didn’t happen.</p>
<p>But I have wonderful memories of getting to Hamburg.  And it was a holiday weekend, and we were at a place not unlike this in Hamburg, and the band that was supposed to play that weekend was unable to do it, and it was a holiday weekend.  And my friend said, well, we’re a band, and they said oh, all right, come back tomorrow and play a few songs, and if you’re even – if you’re any good, we’ll let you play over the holiday weekend.  And we had another member of the band with us on this road trip, and we met up with a couple of my German friends – his name was Carsten Gerlach – Carsten’s friends who lived – were still living in Hamburg, who were actually very good musicians.  We practiced all morning, went to the bar at night, the late afternoon, played a few songs.  They said, well, not great but it’s better than having no band.  (Laughter.)  And we played for the – we played all of the shows for the weekend.  I think we were underage, but don’t tell anyone.  (Laughter.)  Anyway, I have extremely warm and strong and long memories of being in Germany and having very close friends.</p>
<p>But I want to pick up where Heiko left off, because as in so many things, we’re in violent agreement.  We have such powerful connections between our countries – the work that our – the governments are doing together, but in a sense even more important, just the connections between our people.  So many generations of Americans who have German ancestry; student-to-student, young people-to-young people exchanges that most of you are involved with; our scientists, including on COVID and bio and tech, for example, working together; businesses.  It’s powerful and it’s deep.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure in my small way that that endures and maybe even grows stronger.  And there are a number of important reasons for that, but it’s really what Heiko was saying that’s most important:  When you think about the problems that we have to deal with, the challenges that we face that are actually having an impact on our lives, your lives, my life, the life of our fellow citizens, whether it’s this pandemic, whether it’s climate change, whether it’s the way new technologies are changing our lives, whether it’s migration, I think the one thing we strongly agree on and believe together is that there’s not a single one of those big things that are having an impact that any one country can effectively deal with alone.  And there is no wall high enough or wide enough to prevent some of the problems that result.</p>
<p>So I think almost more than any time in my life, there is an imperative, a need, for countries to cooperate, to work together.  And the natural thing is when you have the same basic values, that brings you together in cooperation, but it doesn’t just happen; you have to work at it.  And we have – and sometimes we have differences of approach, tactics, et cetera, but the fundamentals are very, very strong.  And I think what so many of you are doing, especially in creating experiences, creating friendships, creating networks even with Americans, with Germans, these kinds of connections are exactly the way going forward we’re going to find ways to cooperate and deal together with the challenges that we face.</p>
<p>We both know that our responsibility in whatever way we can is to try to demonstrate that our countries, our democracies – that’s what joins us in terms of values – that we can actually produce results that – whether it’s a problem or an opportunity, we can help address it.  If we can’t do that, we are not going to have a lot of confidence of the people that we represent.  If we can do that, that’s how you make progress.  And you are all very much a part of that idea.  This can’t happen without the connections that you’re making, without the – I think the – hopefully the cooperation and work that you’ll do with people, not just United States and Germany, but across Europe and across the world.  It’s never been more important, and so I’m really glad to have this opportunity to exchange some ideas and to hear from you what you’re thinking about, what concerns you, because we have to be able to meet the things that are shaping your lives, that you care about, that you see as having an impact for good or for bad on your futures.  That’s our responsibility, but we need to know that we’re actually focused on the right thing.</p>
<p>And it’s – we talked about having an event with young people, and I said, “Oh, I don’t feel that old.”  (Laughter.)  But it really does make a big, big difference because – I won’t speak for Heiko, but you get to a certain age, and as much as you try to have an open mind, you can get set in your ways, in your viewpoint, in the way you approach things.  And it’s so important for me, for us, to hear from people from different backgrounds, different experiences, different generations.  So thank you for being here today.  (Applause.)</p>

<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Welcome to Berlin, the transatlantic relations and the focus today.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, first, it’s wonderful to be with all of you.  And I’ve got to say, Heiko, as much as I love the foreign ministry and as much as the chancellor’s office is extraordinary, this is a pretty good place to have a conversation.  And I asked for the smaller one.  They were going to give me a larger one, but cheers, first of all.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  A couple of things.  First of all, it’s wonderful to see all of you, and I’m really looking forward to hearing from you and talking to you.  I have a deep personal affection for Germany that goes back many years.  I had the great experience and good fortune after being born in New York and living in New York until I was nine years old and moving when I was nine to Paris, and my closest friends in school in Paris were both, as it turned out, German – both when I first got there when I was nine, ten years old, and then later another good friend who was my closest friend through high school.  And we were in a band together.  He was actually talented, unlike me.  (Laughter.)  But we – one spring break we took a road trip, and we drove from Paris to Hamburg, and we – maybe we thought we were going to be like the Beatles when they spent time in Hamburg and then they got famous afterward.  That didn’t happen.</p>
<p>But I have wonderful memories of getting to Hamburg.  And it was a holiday weekend, and we were at a place not unlike this in Hamburg, and the band that was supposed to play that weekend was unable to do it, and it was a holiday weekend.  And my friend said, well, we’re a band, and they said oh, all right, come back tomorrow and play a few songs, and if you’re even – if you’re any good, we’ll let you play over the holiday weekend.  And we had another member of the band with us on this road trip, and we met up with a couple of my German friends – his name was Carsten Gerlach – Carsten’s friends who lived – were still living in Hamburg, who were actually very good musicians.  We practiced all morning, went to the bar at night, the late afternoon, played a few songs.  They said, well, not great but it’s better than having no band.  (Laughter.)  And we played for the – we played all of the shows for the weekend.  I think we were underage, but don’t tell anyone.  (Laughter.)  Anyway, I have extremely warm and strong and long memories of being in Germany and having very close friends.</p>
<p>But I want to pick up where Heiko left off, because as in so many things, we’re in violent agreement.  We have such powerful connections between our countries – the work that our – the governments are doing together, but in a sense even more important, just the connections between our people.  So many generations of Americans who have German ancestry; student-to-student, young people-to-young people exchanges that most of you are involved with; our scientists, including on COVID and bio and tech, for example, working together; businesses.  It’s powerful and it’s deep.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure in my small way that that endures and maybe even grows stronger.  And there are a number of important reasons for that, but it’s really what Heiko was saying that’s most important:  When you think about the problems that we have to deal with, the challenges that we face that are actually having an impact on our lives, your lives, my life, the life of our fellow citizens, whether it’s this pandemic, whether it’s climate change, whether it’s the way new technologies are changing our lives, whether it’s migration, I think the one thing we strongly agree on and believe together is that there’s not a single one of those big things that are having an impact that any one country can effectively deal with alone.  And there is no wall high enough or wide enough to prevent some of the problems that result.</p>
<p>So I think almost more than any time in my life, there is an imperative, a need, for countries to cooperate, to work together.  And the natural thing is when you have the same basic values, that brings you together in cooperation, but it doesn’t just happen; you have to work at it.  And we have – and sometimes we have differences of approach, tactics, et cetera, but the fundamentals are very, very strong.  And I think what so many of you are doing, especially in creating experiences, creating friendships, creating networks even with Americans, with Germans, these kinds of connections are exactly the way going forward we’re going to find ways to cooperate and deal together with the challenges that we face.</p>
<p>We both know that our responsibility in whatever way we can is to try to demonstrate that our countries, our democracies – that’s what joins us in terms of values – that we can actually produce results that – whether it’s a problem or an opportunity, we can help address it.  If we can’t do that, we are not going to have a lot of confidence of the people that we represent.  If we can do that, that’s how you make progress.  And you are all very much a part of that idea.  This can’t happen without the connections that you’re making, without the – I think the – hopefully the cooperation and work that you’ll do with people, not just United States and Germany, but across Europe and across the world.  It’s never been more important, and so I’m really glad to have this opportunity to exchange some ideas and to hear from you what you’re thinking about, what concerns you, because we have to be able to meet the things that are shaping your lives, that you care about, that you see as having an impact for good or for bad on your futures.  That’s our responsibility, but we need to know that we’re actually focused on the right thing.</p>
<p>And it’s – we talked about having an event with young people, and I said, “Oh, I don’t feel that old.”  (Laughter.)  But it really does make a big, big difference because – I won’t speak for Heiko, but you get to a certain age, and as much as you try to have an open mind, you can get set in your ways, in your viewpoint, in the way you approach things.  And it’s so important for me, for us, to hear from people from different backgrounds, different experiences, different generations.  So thank you for being here today.  (Applause.)</p>
