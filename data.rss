		<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Los Angeles, California</p>
<p>Los Angeles Convention Center</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Good afternoon, everyone. It’s good to see everyone, and I don’t want to be the only thing standing between you and – I guess it’s lunch. Well, yes, we’re in Latin America, so it’s lunch. Wonderful to see everyone here today and thank you all for joining for lunch. Folks will be flying home in just a few hours, and that’s actually when the real work begins – implementing, doing what we said we would do here at the summit.</p>
<p>But I just wanted to take a minute to say, first of all, how grateful we are that everyone here has put so much into making this summit a success. What we’ve accomplished in Los Angeles is the result of months of consultation and coordination among all of our teams.</p>
<p>And now, as I said, we have to make good on our pledges and turn them into concrete progress, and to do that, we have to keep that collaboration going. So I hope we can take the spirit that we have here and work together to turn it into real results.</p>
<p>I wanted to say a few words about the Joint Summit Working Group organizations, because you will play a key role in making this happen. This, as you know, is a network of regional and international institutions that gives critical technical guidance and other support for summit commitments across our hemisphere.</p>
<p>To cite a few examples, last month, the Pan-American Health Organization launched a new information platform for our countries to share data on public health and on migration, so that we can better meet the medical needs of migrants, from COVID-19 to pre- and post-natal care.</p>
<p>Last year, the Caribbean Development Bank – another Joint Working Group organization – helped to mobilize $80 million to support the pandemic response in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The Organization of American States played a critical role in the Energy and Climate Partnership that came out of the Fifth Summit of the Americas back in 2009 – holding more than 40 technical meetings, workshops, policy dialogues to advance renewable energy and to mitigate the dangerous effects of climate change across our region.</p>
<p>Speaking of the OAS, we have a law in the United States known as the OAS Legislative Engagement Act, and that calls for the creation of a forum for legislators across the hemisphere to increase their participation in OAS activities. We have a bipartisan team of U.S. senators, led by Senator Ben Cardin, Senator Roger Wicker, who are helping to drive that process. Many of the members of Congress here today will be part of that endeavor, and we’re grateful for that.</p>
<p>Having elected officials from across our region become more involved in the OAS – a leading institution for supporting democracy in the Americas – that will make its work stronger.</p>
<p>Speaking for the United States, we look forward to working with partners across the region to carry out the initiatives that our leaders announced in these days.</p>
<p>This includes the Americas Health Corps, to train half a million – I’m going to repeat that number – half a million health professionals across the region over the next five years. Imagine what that can do to lift the foundation of health care across our region, not only in dealing with potentially future pandemics but in day-in/day-out health care for all the peoples of our region. Half a million trained workers.</p>
<p>The Digital Agenda for Transformation in the Americas, to try to increase access to digital tools, to training and opportunities – that too has tremendous potential to bridge the digital divide, to connect small businesses to the marketplace, to bring education to students where it’s needed.</p>
<p>The Cities Forward initiative, to direct more support to cities, because we know that’s where so much innovation and problem-solving is actually taking place. Parenthetically, I think as many of you know, next year we’re going to have our first Cities Summit of the Americas – Denver will host it – because again, so much is happening at a local municipal level. We want to tap into that.</p>
<p>On these and all the ambitious initiatives that our countries made, we will lean on our Joint Working Group partners to actually make them real, to actually produce concrete results.</p>
<p>So that’s why we wanted to convene one more time before leaving California – so we can get started on hammering out our next steps.</p>
<p>Let me say again how much I’ve appreciated our time together here in Los Angeles. It has been inspiring. It’s been energizing. And I think seeing representatives come together from across the region – not just from government, as important as that is, but from civil society, from the private sector, young people, international organizations – all driven by a fundamental desire to deliver results that will make a real difference in the lives of our people, to actually be responsive to what our citizens demand, what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>Last word. The theme of this summit – “Building a Sustainable, Resilient, Equitable Future” – that speaks to many of the challenges facing our countries, from climate to COVID to building stronger economies. But we throw these words around – sustainable, resilient, equitable. They have a real meaning, and that’s important. We need to focus on what they actually mean.</p>
<p>So we seek a sustainable future, through long-term investments – not just expensive short-term fixes – on energy, on economic development, and so much else, so that we have a real and durable foundation for progress that can pay off not just in the next months but over many years and over many decades.</p>
<p>We seek a resilient future, and that simply means that our governments and our societies will be better placed to respond to crises of all kinds, to do it swiftly, to do it capably, learning from the lessons of the past to try to protect our people and help them get back on their feet when emergencies happen.</p>
<p>And we seek an equitable future, and that simply means that everyone – no matter where they live, no matter who they are – have access to economic, social, educational opportunities, and are treated with equal respect and dignity.</p>
<p>That is the meaning of those words, and now our challenge is to make them real, to make them concrete, to make genuine progress. It’s a shared vision for the hemisphere that we share. And as President Biden said on Wednesday, there has never been a greater need for cooperation, for common purpose, and yes, for transformative ideas. Here in Los Angeles, we’ve actually deepened that cooperation. We’ve affirmed a common purpose. And we’re embracing transformative ideas, which we now have to turn into lasting progress.</p>
<p>That’s what the partnerships represented in this room are charged with now. And as we think about leaving Los Angeles, I can say that we’ve come together for three days. I’m looking forward to the next 362 days, and then the 365 days after that, and after that, when we demonstrate that what we did here is going to bring real positive change in the lives of our people.</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for being here. Let’s carry on the work. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>

<p>Canada, Mexico, and the United States share a close relationship based on shared values and priorities. We acknowledge that working together as North America we can bring new ideas and energy to the hemisphere, and we commit to reinvigorating how we address together the issues of our time. As three likeminded countries, we affirm our strong commitment to democratic principles and intend to cooperate closely to stand up for multilateralism and the rules-based international order, support the rule of law, promote inclusive growth, invest in the development of communities, protect and promote human rights, advance gender equality, and reinforce democracy at home and inspire democratic development around the world. We worked together towards ending the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to create the conditions for equitable growth and strengthening North American competitiveness. On the occasion of today’s North American Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Los Angeles, our three countries commit to further enhancing our deep partnership and to continue working together in support of peace and prosperity around the globe.</p>
<p>We reaffirm our support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and condemn Russia’s unprovoked invasion of its sovereign and democratic neighbor in violation of international law. Canada, Mexico, and the United States have repeatedly condemned civilian deaths resulting from Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and stated the importance of upholding international law, including the UN Charter. We also emphasize the urgent need to allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need. These are principles that sustain our rules-based order. We affirm the need to ensure accountability in relevant national and international courts for crimes committed, without exceptions, and support the work of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine established by the Human Rights Council. We are united in our continued support for the people of Ukraine. We also express our commitment to work together in support of those suffering around the world from the global impacts of this invasion, particularly vulnerable populations now experiencing greater food and economic insecurity.</p>
<p>Our coordinated responses to Russian aggression against Ukraine, including calls to establish a diplomatic path forward, demonstrate the importance of North American solidarity. We call on the Russian Federation to withdraw immediately all its military forces and equipment from within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine and return to a path of dialogue and diplomacy. Canada,</p>
<p>Mexico, and the United States – as close hemispheric partners and friends – are committed to further strengthening our relations, which is key to our collective security and prosperity.</p>
<p>We reaffirm our commitment to addressing the root causes of irregular migration and poverty and to investing in the region – prioritizing cooperation for development to create economic opportunity for all. In particular, the three governments are united in efforts towards investing in initiatives that directly benefit the most marginalized communities. We support multilateral efforts to develop value chains and physical infrastructure in the Americas that will generate employment and equitable growth. We acknowledge that addressing irregular migration in the region requires a coordinated approach, and we support the Regional Conference on Migration, the Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework and the vision of the Global Compact on Migration.</p>
<p>We celebrate the tradition of our region in welcoming refugees and migrants, and we recognize the positive contributions of refugees and migrants to the socio-economic development of their host communities. We applaud the sustained efforts of States in our hemisphere in ensuring safe, orderly, and regular migration by hosting refugees, providing regular migration pathways, promoting local economic and social integration, facilitating voluntary return, and supporting the reintegration of returnees. We remain committed to collectively leveraging the benefits of migration while addressing its challenges in countries and communities of origin, transit, destination, and return.</p>
<p>We are committed to continuing our cooperation to support and strengthen Haiti’s democratic process, including through our collective efforts to promote an inclusive, Haitian-led political path forward. We are also committed to working closely with the United Nations and other regional partners to promote peaceful, fair, and sustainable growth throughout the hemisphere.</p>
<p>We reaffirm our commitment to protect human rights, particularly for members of vulnerable and historically marginalized communities, like the LGBTQI+ and two spirit community, and afro-descendant communities, as well as the rights of Indigenous peoples. We also stress the importance of individual freedom of expression and media freedom, and together advocate for addressing impunity and inequality.</p>
<p>We collectively commit to taking bold, swift, and coordinated action to address the climate crisis. Climate change threatens our economies and our communities, especially those who are vulnerable and underserved. As we work to address the climate crisis, we recognize the tremendous opportunity to build back better, to create well-paying and reliable jobs in ever-growing markets, and to position North America as a global leader in clean energy solutions.</p>
<p>As partner countries in championing development in the Americas, we reaffirm our commitment to advancing feminist approaches, eliminating structural and indirect barriers for women, girls and marginalized people, and to integrate gender perspectives in our shared priorities. We continue to advocate for feminist approaches for a more effective, fair, relevant and accountable United Nations in support of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>We recognize the integral place of Indigenous peoples in North America, and their contributions to the diversity and richness of our culture and society. We acknowledge that cultural diversity and linguistic plurality are part of the heritage of humanity, so we place great value in the historical and cultural legacy of indigenous communities in the region.</p>
<p>By recognizing the historical legacy towards indigenous communities, our vision aims to achieve real progress towards reconciliation and a renewed relationship based on respect, truth, cooperation, partnership, and in recognition of the rights of Indigenous peoples. We reiterate our unwavering commitment to ensure that Indigenous rights, interests, and aspirations are recognized in decision-making. We intend to work together, in partnership with Indigenous peoples from our three countries, to attain our goals of safety, security, well-being, socio-economic development, and empowerment for all Indigenous peoples. We also recognize that ending violence against Indigenous women and girls requires a holistic, multidimensional, and multi-sectoral approach.</p>
<p>During our meeting today, we also discussed planning for the next North American Leaders’ Summit in Mexico in December.</p>
<p>We look forward to our increased cooperation in the years to come.</p>

We affirm the need to ensure accountability in relevant national and international courts for crimes committed, without exceptions, and support the work of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine established by the Human Rights Council. We are united in our continued support for the people of Ukraine. We also express our commitment to work together in support of those suffering around the world from the global impacts of this invasion, particularly vulnerable populations now experiencing greater food and economic insecurity.</p>
<p>Our coordinated responses to Russian aggression against Ukraine, including calls to establish a diplomatic path forward, demonstrate the importance of North American solidarity. We call on the Russian Federation to withdraw immediately all its military forces and equipment from within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine and return to a path of dialogue and diplomacy. Canada,</p>
<p>Mexico, and the United States – as close hemispheric partners and friends – are committed to further strengthening our relations, which is key to our collective security and prosperity.</p>
<p>We reaffirm our commitment to addressing the root causes of irregular migration and poverty and to investing in the region – prioritizing cooperation for development to create economic opportunity for all. In particular, the three governments are united in efforts towards investing in initiatives that directly benefit the most marginalized communities. We support multilateral efforts to develop value chains and physical infrastructure in the Americas that will generate employment and equitable growth. We acknowledge that addressing irregular migration in the region requires a coordinated approach, and we support the Regional Conference on Migration, the Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework and the vision of the Global Compact on Migration.</p>
<p>We celebrate the tradition of our region in welcoming refugees and migrants, and we recognize the positive contributions of refugees and migrants to the socio-economic development of their host communities. We applaud the sustained efforts of States in our hemisphere in ensuring safe, orderly, and regular migration by hosting refugees, providing regular migration pathways, promoting local economic and social integration, facilitating voluntary return, and supporting the reintegration of returnees. We remain committed to collectively leveraging the benefits of migration while addressing its challenges in countries and communities of origin, transit, destination, and return.</p>
<p>We are committed to continuing our cooperation to support and strengthen Haiti’s democratic process, including through our collective efforts to promote an inclusive, Haitian-led political path forward. We are also committed to working closely with the United Nations and other regional partners to promote peaceful, fair, and sustainable growth throughout the hemisphere.</p>
<p>We reaffirm our commitment to protect human rights, particularly for members of vulnerable and historically marginalized communities, like the LGBTQI+ and two spirit community, and afro-descendant communities, as well as the rights of Indigenous peoples. We also stress the importance of individual freedom of expression and media freedom, and together advocate for addressing impunity and inequality.</p>
<p>We collectively commit to taking bold, swift, and coordinated action to address the climate crisis. Climate change threatens our economies and our communities, especially those who are vulnerable and underserved. As we work to address the climate crisis, we recognize the tremendous opportunity to build back better, to create well-paying and reliable jobs in ever-growing markets, and to position North America as a global leader in clean energy solutions.</p>
<p>As partner countries in championing development in the Americas, we reaffirm our commitment to advancing feminist approaches, eliminating structural and indirect barriers for women, girls and marginalized people, and to integrate gender perspectives in our shared priorities. We continue to advocate for feminist approaches for a more effective, fair, relevant and accountable United Nations in support of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>We recognize the integral place of Indigenous peoples in North America, and their contributions to the diversity and richness of our culture and society. We acknowledge that cultural diversity and linguistic plurality are part of the heritage of humanity, so we place great value in the historical and cultural legacy of indigenous communities in the region.</p>
<p>By recognizing the historical legacy towards indigenous communities, our vision aims to achieve real progress towards reconciliation and a renewed relationship based on respect, truth, cooperation, partnership, and in recognition of the rights of Indigenous peoples. We reiterate our unwavering commitment to ensure that Indigenous rights, interests, and aspirations are recognized in decision-making. We intend to work together, in partnership with Indigenous peoples from our three countries, to attain our goals of safety, security, well-being, socio-economic development, and empowerment for all Indigenous peoples. We also recognize that ending violence against Indigenous women and girls requires a holistic, multidimensional, and multi-sectoral approach.</p>
<p>During our meeting today, we also discussed planning for the next North American Leaders’ Summit in Mexico in December.</p>
<p>We look forward to our increased cooperation in the years to come.</p>

		<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Los Angeles, California</p>
<p>Los Angeles Convention Center</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good morning, everyone.  It’s a great pleasure to be here in Los Angeles with my friends and partners from Mexico and from Canada.  Foreign Minister Ebrard, Foreign Minister Joly, thank you for joining us today.  Simply put, Mexico and Canada are our two literally and figuratively closest partners in the hemisphere.  We are working together every single day on the issues that have animated this summit, including working together to try to engage the COVID challenge, the climate challenge, the migration challenge, the technology challenge that each of our countries faces.  And I think we are brought together by a common conviction that we are going to be much more effective in dealing with these challenges when we work together than when we stand alone.  And that’s been the spirit that’s animated the relationships among us, including at the North American Leaders’ Summit that President Biden and President López Obrador and Prime Minister Trudeau have animated so strongly.</p>
<p>Our ability to coordinate, collaborate, cooperate is going to make a huge difference in actually advancing the various initiatives that this summit is launching or reinforcing.  So I welcome this opportunity for us to compare notes as we head into the final day of the summit, and to look not just at the three days that we spent together here in Los Angeles, but the next 362 days to work together to make good on the commitments that we share.</p>
<p>So with that, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:  </strong>Good morning.  Thank you very much, Antony, in the first place for the warm reception for the Mexican delegation, and congratulations for the summit.  Really amazing, the organization and everything.  Thank you very much for that.</p>
<p>Hello, Mélanie.  Nice to meet you – to see you again and the Canadian delegation.  It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p>As Antony Blinken mentioned, we have a lot of things to work on daily – daily – because it’s a very intense relationship between our countries.  And we have common purposes in order to prepare the North American Leaders’ Summit this year, which is going to be held in Mexico, maybe Mexico City.  And so we have right now some results for the summit which are very positive in our view, from the Mexico view – point of view, regarding the America prosperity, all the continent prosperity in the next months and years, how to recover from pandemic, how to coordinate our efforts in order to strengthen our inter-American organizations, and how to deal with a regional approach for migration and labor mobility.</p>
<p>So a lot of work to do, and we have a very positive relationship, very honest one between us, and we hope that we are going to have this meeting today, other steps ahead in our common objectives.  Thank you very much, Antony.  Thank you, Mélanie.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:  </strong>Thank you, Tony, for hosting us.  It’s always a pleasure to see you.  We’ve been seeing each other a lot over the past months.  Good to see you, Marcelo, as well, and thank you for organizing this meeting.  It is the first meeting of the foreign ministers of the three countries together, so I hope this becomes a tradition, and of course we will work on preparing the North American Leaders’ Summit which will be happening in Mexico, and I think, Marcelo, you just said to the press Mexico City.</p>
<p>So at the same time, we will work on many issues.  Tony mentioned them, from climate change to the question of the impacts of the pandemic and migration.  Of course, we’ve seen strong support throughout the hemisphere about the importance of what is happening in Ukraine.  We need to make sure that we continue to have that strong unity across the hemisphere.  And we will talk about how we can continue to address the impacts of this war, including on the question of food security, food prices, and the impacts of – also on gas prices.  So affordability is also a part of the discussions we’ll be having today.</p>
<p>So thank you both.  It’s a pleasure to be working with you again.</p>
<p>(In French.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  (In French.)</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) And of course, what it is in our thoughts now are the impacts of the war in Ukraine, impacts not only in Ukraine but throughout the world, here in the hemisphere, in our continent.  We know the geopolitical impacts of the war are huge, specifically when it comes to food and gas prices.  Thank you very much.</p>

		<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Los Angeles, California</p>
<p>Magic Box</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We appreciate, Secretary, this interview.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Via interpreter) My name is Alejandro.  Thank you for being on SinEmbargo.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  (In Spanish.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Via interpreter) So the president of Mexico did not come to this summit, but that will be solved with a future meeting in July at the White House.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And – but the thing is, what about – (in Spanish) – the OAS &#8212;</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) What about the OAS?  There’s been pressure for so many countries about the utility of the OAS.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  So two things.  First of all, President Biden is very much looking forward to seeing President López Obrador at the White House in July.  They have a very good relationship, great mutual respect, and as do I with my friend and counterpart Marcelo Ebrard.  We talk all the time.  And in this case, we had a good-faith difference of opinion.  That’s – and that’s fine.  I’m very happy that Marcelo is here leading the Mexican delegation, and Mexican civil society and so many others, business leaders, all here at the summit.  So Mexico is very strongly represented, and that’s good.</p>
<p>When it comes to the OAS, listen, this is an organization that we – the United States supports, and its mission, among other things, is to try to uphold the principles that are enshrined in the Democratic Charter of our hemisphere, a charter that really was launched at a Summit of the Americas in 2001, and should be a common document for all of us to be held accountable to.  And the OAS works to do that.  Sometimes that creates some friction, but it’s important that we be held accountable to our democratic principles.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Via interpreter) So why did the U.S. decide not to invite certain countries to this summit, even though the president of Mexico asked for that, and when this is a summit that’s intended – intention is to work on structural problems like inequity and poverty in the Americas?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Yeah.  Well, first I would say that a number of those countries are here.  They are at the summit.  I met yesterday with Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, all of whom are representing their country, from civil society, from the human rights community, from the artistic community.  They are as representative – I would argue more representative – of their countries than their governments at this point in time.  So they’re here; those countries are all here at the summit.</p>
<p>And of course, in a different way, as I said, Mexico is fully here with a very strong delegation led by my friend and counterpart, the Foreign Minister Ebrard.  As I said, we had a very respectful difference of opinion on this.  Usually the host country makes the decisions, and we felt it was important at this time to reinforce the Democratic Charter of our hemisphere, and to remind people that we’re supposed to be joined by these democratic principles, and the countries here should reflect that.</p>
<p>But again, all of these countries actually are here.  It may not be in some cases their governments or regimes, which really do not have popular legitimacy.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Thank you very much for being here, Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  <em>Gracias</em>.  Thank you so much.  <em>Gracias.  </em>Nice to meet with you.</p>

<p>The following is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:<b><u></u></b></p>
<p>Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman met today with Thongphane Savanphet, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, in Vientiane.  The Deputy Secretary reaffirmed the United States’ strong support for Lao sovereignty and economic development and underscored the importance of ASEAN centrality and regional stability.  The Deputy Secretary thanked Laos for its participation at the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit and noted the summit demonstrated how the United States prioritizes its relationship with Southeast Asian partners.  The Deputy Secretary and the Deputy Foreign Minister discussed ways to deepen U.S.-Laos cooperation in several areas underpinned by ASEAN unity, respect for human rights, and the rule of law.  The Deputy Secretary highlighted our two countries’ cooperation as current Mekong-U.S. Partnership co-chairs.  Deputy Secretary Sherman also condemned Putin’s war of choice against Ukraine and discussed the impact of Putin’s decision on the global economy. Deputy Secretary Sherman also urged Laos to press for progress on implementing ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus in Burma.  The Deputy Secretary emphasized the importance of war legacy cooperation, our robust U.S.-Laos unexploded ordnance clearance program, and the United States’ continued support to Laos’ COVID-19 recovery efforts.</p>
