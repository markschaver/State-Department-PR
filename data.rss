					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Joining us now is Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good to be with you, Norah.  Thanks.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Well, there were a number of alarming developments today.  Do you believe that Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv could soon fall to Russian forces?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, it’s certainly under threat and it could well be under siege.  This is this opening salvo of a massive invasion, and we see this continuing and threatening Kyiv and threatening other major cities in Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And where is Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy, and how concerned are you about his safety right now?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  To the best of my knowledge, President Zelenskyy remains in Ukraine at his post.  And of course, we’re concerned for the safety of all of our friends in Ukraine, government officials and others.  And we’re doing everything we can to stand with them, to support them.  We’re there for them – not only us, countries throughout Europe and countries around the world.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And we learned today that Russia captured Chernobyl.  Ukraine’s foreign minister raised the specter of another nuclear disaster.  Is that something the U.S. Government is concerned about?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, they’re going after various utilities, power facilities.  Chernobyl is one of them.  Obviously, that causes heightened concern and scrutiny.  It’s something we’re looking very carefully at.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  When President Biden addressed the nation today, he said that Putin wants a new Soviet Union.  Is there intelligence to suggest that President Putin will advance beyond Ukraine?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  You don’t need intelligence to tell you that that’s exactly what President Putin wants.  He’s made clear that he’d like to reconstitute the Soviet empire.  Short of that, he’d like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc.  Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine’s borders, there’s something very powerful standing in his way.  That’s Article 5 of NATO – an attack on one is an attack on all.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  So on that point, I mean, while U.S. troops are not in Ukraine, they are close by.  So what’s being done to lower the risk of some accidental escalation with Russian forces?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, you always want to make sure that you don’t have miscalculations, accidents, and so one of the things we’re looking to do is to be in communication with Russia on a military basis to make very clear what it risks if it miscalculates.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I want to ask you about some of the troubling words from Vladimir Putin’s speech.  He warned of consequences never seen in history.  Was he threatening a nuclear attack?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, I can’t begin to get into his head and to say exactly what he means by that – by those kinds of words, that kind of bluster.  But again, we’ve been prepared for whatever course that he chooses to take.  We were prepared to engage diplomatically, if we could, to divert him from the aggression that he has pursued.  We were also equally prepared now that he’s committed that aggression.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Russia’s economy is fueled by gas, and the U.S. is a consumer.  So would the U.S. consider cutting off oil and gas purchases from Russia?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, what we’re doing, Norah, across the board is making sure that we inflict maximum pain on Russia for what President Putin has done while minimizing any of the pain to us.  We’re in full coordination with other countries, both consumers and producers alike, to minimize any impact that this may have on energy prices and on gasoline.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks, Norah.  Good to be with you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And once again tonight I am joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Mr. Secretary, nothing the U.S. or Europeans have done has been able to stop any of this from happening.  Now the President has announced new and harsher sanctions.  What’s the goal at this point?  Do you believe Putin will suddenly turn around his tanks and head home because of harsher sanctions?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Lester, we’ve been warning about this for a long time.  We’ve been planning on this for a long time.  We’ve gotten allies and partners together for a long time.  And we’ve made it clear that, on the one hand, if President Putin decided to pursue the path of diplomacy and dialogue, we’re ready for that and prepared to engage on that; but equally, if he pursued the path of aggression – which, tragically, is exactly what he’s done – we’re prepared on that too.  And as a result, we have responded in a united way, swiftly, and with real consequence to impose very severe costs on Russia for the aggression it’s committing against Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  If Russia begins to feel cornered and maybe even desperate in all this, do you worry they could become more dangerous and perhaps directly threaten NATO countries?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, first, Lester, when it comes to threatening NATO countries, we have something very powerful called Article 5 – an attack on one is an attack on all.  Russia knows that, and that’s exactly why, among other things, one of our responses has been to shore up NATO’s defenses – to put more forces, to put more equipment on its eastern flank, the countries closest to Russia – to deter any aggression that Russia might be contemplating against NATO countries.</p>
<p>But in terms of doing other things, look, I think you just have to listen to President Putin’s own words.  This is something he was planning all along.  We made every possible effort to deter him, to dissuade him from taking this course.  But clearly, this has been something that he’s planned for a long time, and it’s much bigger than NATO.  This is all about trying to get Ukraine back into his orbit, to reconstitute, if he could, something approximating the Soviet empire, short of that re-exerting a sphere of influence to subjugate countries on his borders to his will.  That’s what’s going on.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And very quickly, any signs that he is losing support at home?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Look, much, much too early to say.  We’ve seen protests.  We’ve seen at least reports of more than a thousand people being arrested for protesting against war, but much too soon to say.  As the impact of this is felt, as the consequences of what President Putin has done is felt, including in Russia, that will have an impact.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Secretary Blinken, always good to talk to you.  Thank you for joining us.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks.  Thanks for having me.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary Blinken, thanks for coming on again tonight.  We heard the President list these new sanctions today against several Russian banks, among other steps being taken.  The President also said direct sanctions against Vladimir Putin, himself, are still on the table here.  You’ve got Putin invading Ukraine from the north, the east, the south, ignoring all calls from the U.S. to stop.  So why is the U.S. not sanctioning him right now?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, first of all, David, the sanctions that we’ve taken – not just us, in coordination with European partners and allies – are going to have severe consequences on Russia &#8211; some immediate, some that play out over time.  We’ve taken the 10 largest financial institutions, holding about 80 percent of Russia’s banking assets; can’t do transactions in dollars or for the most part in Euros.  The ability for Russia to raise money on international market – we’re taking that away.  Their ability to import the technology necessary to modernize their economy, to put into critical industries like defense, like aerospace – that too being taken away.  And this is going to have a very significant impact.</p>
<p>Now, having said that, as the President said, other things remain on the table.  If they continue to escalate, we’ll have the ability to do the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Is there any sign here, though, that Putin cares about these sanctions?  The threats don’t appear to be working so far.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Sanctions have an immediate impact.  We’re seeing that in terms of Russia’s currency, in terms of its markets.  But the impact is really felt over time as, again, it spreads across the economy, about their ability to raise money, to conduct transactions around the world.  That will be felt more and more and more over time.  So, if this continues, the pain will continue, the pain will grow, and that’s going to have an effect too.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  But to be clear here, you are willing to sanction Putin directly, if you have to.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  As the President said, everything’s on the table, including that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I want to ask you about the fighting we know that’s taking place at a military airfield about 20 miles from the capital of Kyiv.  Do we know who is in control of that airfield tonight?  And is it possible Kyiv falls in the next 24 hours?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I’m not in a position to comment on exactly what’s going on, on the ground, at this moment.  But what we do know, and part of the Russian plan has been, to put Kyiv in danger, to assault the capital, to go after other major cities.  We’re seeing forces come in from the north, from the east, from the south, and that’s all part of the plan that we’ve laid out for the world in recent weeks.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  You’re convinced Putin’s going to overthrow this government.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I’m convinced he’s going to try to do that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We’ve seen Ukrainians fight back, the resistance to the Russians in the east.  Is there any chance the Ukrainians can hold on here?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  One of the things that Vladimir Putin has done, starting back in 2014 when they first went into Ukraine, seizing Crimea, seizing a part of eastern Ukraine, is to totally alienate the Ukrainian people from Russia.  Before 2014, actually, Russia was pretty popular in Ukraine.  It had a 70 percent favorability rating.  Right now, it’s exactly the opposite – more than the opposite.  Ninety percent of Ukrainians now, if I can use the word, “detest” Russia and certainly detest President Putin.  My prediction would be that one way or another, they will strongly resist any effort to take away their sovereignty, take away their independence, take away their government.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  They’ll resist, but can they beat the Russians here?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Over – whether it’s in the near term, whether it’s in the medium term, whether it’s in the long term, I am convinced that democracy and the independence of Ukraine is going to prevail.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary Blinken, I know you know there are a lot of people watching tonight, likely wondering could Vladimir Putin go further here.  The President was asked today what if this goes beyond Ukraine, and he said if Putin moves into NATO countries, “we will be involved.”  He said, “We will be involved.”  Is this a possibility?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Is it a possibility that Putin goes beyond Ukraine?  Sure, it’s a possibility, but there’s something very powerful standing in the way of that.  That’s something we call Article 5 of NATO.  That means an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members of NATO.  The President’s been very clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory.  I think that’s the most powerful deterrent against President Putin going beyond Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  You know the President has said all along U.S. troops will not fight in Ukraine against the Russians, but again, this hypothetical – if he goes beyond Ukraine and into NATO – given what you just cited, that means all bets are off the table here.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, it’s not a question of all bets being off the table.  It’s being very clear that we are committed to Article 5.  We’re committed to defending our NATO Allies; and if it comes to that, we’ll do it.  But right now, our focus is on Ukraine, our focus is on trying to prevent President Putin from going even further, but it looks like he’s going for everything he can get.  And so, we’re doing what we said we would do all along.  We’re imposing massive costs.  We’re doing it with allies and partners.  We’re doing it together.  We’re doing it swiftly.  And you’ve seen that already today.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary Blinken, we do appreciate your time again tonight.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks, David.  It’s good to be with you.</p>

<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Sanctions have an immediate impact.  We’re seeing that in terms of Russia’s currency, in terms of its markets.  But the impact is really felt over time as, again, it spreads across the economy, about their ability to raise money, to conduct transactions around the world.  That will be felt more and more and more over time.  So, if this continues, the pain will continue, the pain will grow, and that’s going to have an effect too.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  But to be clear here, you are willing to sanction Putin directly, if you have to.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  As the President said, everything’s on the table, including that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I want to ask you about the fighting we know that’s taking place at a military airfield about 20 miles from the capital of Kyiv.  Do we know who is in control of that airfield tonight?  And is it possible Kyiv falls in the next 24 hours?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I’m not in a position to comment on exactly what’s going on, on the ground, at this moment.  But what we do know, and part of the Russian plan has been, to put Kyiv in danger, to assault the capital, to go after other major cities.  We’re seeing forces come in from the north, from the east, from the south, and that’s all part of the plan that we’ve laid out for the world in recent weeks.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  You’re convinced Putin’s going to overthrow this government.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I’m convinced he’s going to try to do that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We’ve seen Ukrainians fight back, the resistance to the Russians in the east.  Is there any chance the Ukrainians can hold on here?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  One of the things that Vladimir Putin has done, starting back in 2014 when they first went into Ukraine, seizing Crimea, seizing a part of eastern Ukraine, is to totally alienate the Ukrainian people from Russia.  Before 2014, actually, Russia was pretty popular in Ukraine.  It had a 70 percent favorability rating.  Right now, it’s exactly the opposite – more than the opposite.  Ninety percent of Ukrainians now, if I can use the word, “detest” Russia and certainly detest President Putin.  My prediction would be that one way or another, they will strongly resist any effort to take away their sovereignty, take away their independence, take away their government.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  They’ll resist, but can they beat the Russians here?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Over – whether it’s in the near term, whether it’s in the medium term, whether it’s in the long term, I am convinced that democracy and the independence of Ukraine is going to prevail.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary Blinken, I know you know there are a lot of people watching tonight, likely wondering could Vladimir Putin go further here.  The President was asked today what if this goes beyond Ukraine, and he said if Putin moves into NATO countries, “we will be involved.”  He said, “We will be involved.”  Is this a possibility?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Is it a possibility that Putin goes beyond Ukraine?  Sure, it’s a possibility, but there’s something very powerful standing in the way of that.  That’s something we call Article 5 of NATO.  That means an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members of NATO.  The President’s been very clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory.  I think that’s the most powerful deterrent against President Putin going beyond Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  You know the President has said all along U.S. troops will not fight in Ukraine against the Russians, but again, this hypothetical – if he goes beyond Ukraine and into NATO – given what you just cited, that means all bets are off the table here.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, it’s not a question of all bets being off the table.  It’s being very clear that we are committed to Article 5.  We’re committed to defending our NATO Allies; and if it comes to that, we’ll do it.  But right now, our focus is on Ukraine, our focus is on trying to prevent President Putin from going even further, but it looks like he’s going for everything he can get.  And so, we’re doing what we said we would do all along.  We’re imposing massive costs.  We’re doing it with allies and partners.  We’re doing it together.  We’re doing it swiftly.  And you’ve seen that already today.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary Blinken, we do appreciate your time again tonight.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks, David.  It’s good to be with you.</p>
