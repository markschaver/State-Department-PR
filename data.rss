					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It’s a pleasure to be able to receive Foreign Minister Popescu, to return some of the very warm hospitality that the foreign minister, the president, the prime minister showed me and our team when we were in Moldova just a couple of months ago.  And needless to say, this is an especially timely visit given the ongoing Russian aggression against Ukraine and the challenge that it poses to other countries in the region.</p>
<p>We in the United States strongly support Moldova’s independence, its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, and we continue to work very closely together in practical support of all of those things.  I have to say, Nicu, that the humanitarian response that you’ve provided to the Russian aggression in Ukraine is extraordinary, something like 400,000 refugees from Ukraine going to and through Moldova, about 100,000 or so will remain in Moldova.  And the generosity that Moldova is showing – the Moldovan people are showing – is really exceptional.  We have tried to be as helpful as we can be, including at the most recent conference that took place to help support the efforts that you’re undertaking, and we’ll continue to do that.</p>
<p>I’m very pleased much more broadly, though, that we are actually coming together as a result of our strategic dialogue.  We welcome you for that, glad that you had an opportunity to meet with other colleagues and for the dialogue to go forward so that our partnership could even strengthen, especially in these challenging times.  So welcome.  It’s great to have you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER POPESCU:  </strong>Thank you very much for this – for these kind words.  And this year the United States and Moldova have 30 years of diplomatic relations.  This is happening around with – in these first few months of the year.  And in this period, the United States has been a strong supporter of Moldovan independence, of Moldovan reforms, of Moldovan democracy.</p>
<p>And we are very grateful for this support, and this occasion of my visit to Washington with strategic dialogue that we are relaunching now is focused on key elements that would allow Moldova to continuously strengthen its resilience, its capacity to perform as a democratic state and society.  And today I met your colleagues, and we have been – we’ve structured our dialogue on three – on three pillars, if you want.  One working group was on energy and economic issues; the second working group on rule of law and anti-corruption; and the third group on political and security cooperation.  And all – on all of these three fronts, we think that our relation is excellent.  We have a very good interaction with your colleagues, and we’ve always felt U.S. support for Moldova.</p>
<p>Of course, we are in a very difficult region at a very difficult time.  And everyone in Europe is affected by this war.  Everyone in Europe feels less secure than just two months ago, but that is a new situation that is challenging also us in Moldova.  As you mentioned, we have had a huge wave of refugees.  Almost 4 percent of our population are refugees today.  Half of them are minors under 18 years old, so this represents 10 percent of our population of minors in Moldova.  With that dramatic numbers, we have been handling the situation reasonably well, but of course that affects us all and that will continue to affect our region and our society for a long time.</p>
<p>Of course, we from the first days and hours of the war, we have strongly condemned the Russian aggression of Ukraine – against Ukraine, and we’re looking forward for a peaceful resolution of this war which is completely unjustified and is making whole of Europe less secure.  And just this last thing that matters for us and for our government is to continue our strong focus on reforms, strong focus on delivering of the mandate given by our population, and this mandate presupposes a fight against corruption, economic progress, modernization of our country, because I think it’s important for us but it’s also important for everyone else in the region to show that democracy works in our part of the world and that the reforms pay off and that people can feel the results of these reform efforts.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you very much.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States welcomes the arrival today of a truck convoy carrying over 1,700 metric tons of life-saving humanitarian assistance in Tigray. We appreciate the efforts of the government of Ethiopia, Tigrayan regional authorities, and Afar regional authorities in facilitating that delivery. We also commend the United Nations agencies, international organizations, U.S. government partners, and the ongoing efforts of humanitarian organizations across Ethiopia to provide aid to all those in need. We reiterate the importance of significant, sustained, unconditional, and unhindered humanitarian access to Tigray—as well as to all communities that are suffering, including the people in Afar —and the urgency of the resumption of basic services, including electricity, telecommunications, and banking.</p>
<p>The continued commitment of the government of Ethiopia and Tigrayan authorities to a cessation of hostilities remains a critical step toward reconciliation and peace. In that regard, we welcome the withdrawal of Tigrayan forces from Erebti and underscore the importance of further withdrawals from Afar regional state. The parties must continue to build on this progress to advance a negotiated and sustainable end of conflict. Progress toward this goal is an essential foundation for restoration of essential services in Tigray and an inclusive political process to provide security and prosperity for all Ethiopians.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>At the end of a three-week trip to Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Qatar by U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking, we have seen U.S. diplomatic efforts yield tangible results that improve the lives of Yemenis and advance peace.  The United States supported the UN’s efforts to secure a two-month truce, which began on April 2 and provides immediate relief to Yemenis by easing the movement of people and goods, including fuel.  In Special Envoy Lenderking’s subsequent engagements, he has urged the parties to adhere to the UN truce terms to pave the way for a viable, durable resolution to the conflict.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the Special Envoy has pressed for transparent, inclusive Yemeni-led efforts to reform the government of Yemen to ensure it meets the needs of all citizens and address their calls for justice, accountability, and redress for human rights violations and abuses.  On April 7, we welcomed Yemen’s establishment of a Presidential Leadership Council, which we urge to advance these goals in partnership with Yemeni civil society and members of marginalized communities.  We urge the Leadership Council to work closely with the Prime Minister and his government to strengthen basic services and economic stability as soon as possible, so that Yemenis can receive the tangible benefits of recent reforms.</p>
<p>During his trip, Special Envoy Lenderking continued his advocacy for additional humanitarian assistance to help close funding gaps that have reduced life-saving assistance for millions of Yemenis, as well as for additional economic assistance to address Yemen’s growing economic crisis.  In this regard, we welcomed the pledge by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to each provide $1 billion in economic support for the Central Bank of Yemen, and Saudi Arabia’s pledge to provide $1 billion for development projects and fuel support as well as $300 million for the UN’s humanitarian response plan.</p>
<p>The Special Envoy concluded his trip by joining a UN-led mission to raise awareness about the threat posed by the derelict <em>Safer </em>oil tanker and raise funds for an emergency UN plan to avert the devastating regional economic, humanitarian, and environmental consequences of a spill.  We commend those who have pledged financial support and encourage other donors to contribute to this new UN-coordinated plan to protect shipping, commerce, tourism, livelihoods, and coastal habitats across the Red Sea.</p>
<p>We must capitalize on this positive, unique momentum by securing a more lasting halt to fighting and a renewed, comprehensive peace process.  Yemenis are expressing cautious optimism for the first time in years as a result of the constructive steps in recent weeks.  All parties to the conflict must answer Yemenis’ demands for peace by choosing dialogue over destruction and cooperating with UN-led peace efforts.  There is hard work ahead and the United States remains committed to supporting the people of Yemen’s aspirations for a more prosperous and stable future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will travel to Panama April 19-20 to co-host a Ministerial Conference on Migration and Protection with the Government of Panama.  Following the commitments expressed at the Regional Migration Ministerial in Colombia in October 2021, Secretary Blinken and representatives of regional governments participating in the Ministerial will discuss collaboration on safe, orderly, and humane migration throughout our hemisphere.  Bringing together leaders from twenty Western Hemisphere nations, this Ministerial represents an important step forward in developing a migration management and protection framework for the Americas.</p>
<p>Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas will join Secretary Blinken in Panama.  The United States will also be represented by State Department Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian A. Nichols and Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees, and Migration Julieta Noyes, DHS Assistant Secretary for International Affairs Serena Hoy, DHS Assistant Secretary for Border and Immigration Policy Blas Nunez Neto, USAID Assistant Administrator for the Bureau of Latin America and the Caribbean Marcela Escobari, and Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Transborder Security Catherine Tobin.</p>
<p>While in Panama, Secretary Blinken will meet with President Laurentino Cortizo Cohen, Foreign Minister Erika Mouynes, multilateral development banks, international financial institutions, international organizations, and NGOs to discuss economic recovery; migration; protection for refugees, asylum seekers, and vulnerable migrants; anti-corruption efforts; and support for civil society, in addition to other regional and bilateral issues of importance to the United States and Panama.  The Secretary will also tour the Panama Canal to review this vital component of regional and international trade and host a roundtable discussion with regional civil society leaders focused on transparency and anti-corruption efforts, a growing challenge for democracy and economic stability in the hemisphere.</p>
<p>Through this visit, the Secretary will draw further attention and excitement in the region towards the Ninth Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, California on June 6-10, 2022, where Western Hemisphere leaders will expand on efforts to address our hemisphere’s most pressing issues with the aim of building a sustainable, resilient, and equitable future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of State has no greater responsibility than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas.  We are committed to providing U.S. citizens with up-to-date and timely information, so they are informed as they make international travel plans and when they are abroad.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Given the increases in international travel, the availability of effective COVID-19 mitigation measures, and recently announced changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) COVID-19 Travel Health Notice (THN) process, we have reassessed how COVID-19 considerations factor into our Travel Advisory levels for U.S. citizens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Starting next week, the State Department Travel Advisory levels will no longer automatically correlate with the CDC COVID-19 THN level.  However, if the CDC raises a country’s COVID-19 THN to a Level 4, the State Department’s Travel Advisory for that country will also be raised to a Level 4: Do Not Travel due to COVID-19.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This update will leave approximately 10% of all Travel Advisories at Level 4: Do Not Travel.  This 10% includes Level 4 Travel Advisories for all risk indicators, not just COVID-19.  We believe the updated framework will help U.S. citizens make better informed decisions about the safety of international travel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Although conditions have recently improved, the COVID-19 pandemic is not over.  We continue to advise travelers to consider COVID-19 conditions and restrictions at their destinations when considering international travel.  Our embassies and consulates around the world will continue to provide the latest country-specific COVID-19-related information on their<span> </span><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/COVID-19-Country-Specific-Information.html">websites</a>.  To see the latest State Department Travel Advisories for any country in the world, visit<span> </span><a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA0MTQuNTY0MTEyNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RyYXZlbC5zdGF0ZS5nb3YvY29udGVudC90cmF2ZWwvZW4vdHJhdmVsYWR2aXNvcmllcy90cmF2ZWxhZHZpc29yaWVzLmh0bWwvIn0.C7cqloGI8MkiT5P5zJpM4iJ8E3yEosgtEjgDjCBlZ8Q%2Fs%2F402704358%2Fbr%2F129806199590-l&amp;data=04%7C01%7CTranMJ%40state.gov%7C4b26ab571062491264f808da1e1ae649%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637855398126092257%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=MpcHcvOH71wY4nTyIrQvuM7wO4f8ge4wSsntlFx2EOU%3D&amp;reserved=0">travel.state.gov</a>.  We encourage U.S. citizens who are considering international travel this summer to check their passport expiration date and act now to renew or apply for the first time.  Keep in mind many countries require passports to have at least six months’ remaining validity for entry.  Routine passport processing can take eight to eleven weeks.
