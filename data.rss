					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><i>The text of the following communiqué was agreed upon by the Special Representatives and Envoys for Afghanistan from the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States in Brussels, April 5, 2022. </i></p>
<p><i>Begin Text:</i></p>
<p>The Special Representatives and Special Envoys of the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States met in Brussels on 5 April 2022 to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. Deborah Lyons, SRSG for Afghanistan, also attended the meeting, which included technical sessions with the World Bank and UNICEF.</p>
<p>The Special Representatives and Envoys:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reaffirmed their strong commitment to the Afghan people and the need to continue to address the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan; the importance of adherence to International Humanitarian Law and the independence of humanitarian operations; stressed the importance of all humanitarian staff, including female staff, having unhindered access to any areas of the country necessary to perform their jobs effectively and the need for all Afghans in need to have unhindered access to humanitarian aid; and called for any remaining obstacle to the provision of humanitarian assistance to be removed immediately.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Condemned the Taliban’s decision on 23 March 2022 to continue denying Afghan girls the ability to attend secondary education, which contradicts the Taliban’s assurances to the Afghan people and to the international community; affirmed that every Afghan citizen, in all provinces of the country and regardless of gender, has an equal right to education at all levels; called for an immediate reversal of the ban on education for girls above grade 6; and emphasised that the type and scope of international donor assistance will depend, among other things, on the right and ability of girls to attend equal education at all levels.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Noted that their governments and organisations had already substantially increased humanitarian and basic needs support, including for healthcare, to the Afghan people to mitigate Afghanistan’s humanitarian and economic crisis and to ensure the continuation of basic services. Highlighted that 2.23 billion EUR were raised at the international humanitarian pledging conference on 31 March 2022, and nearly two thirds (1.42 billion EUR) of this total came from the combined pledges of the EU, EU Member States, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Reaffirmed that progress towards normalised relations between the Taliban and the international community will depend mostly on the Taliban’s actions and their delivery on commitments and obligations to the Afghan people and to the international community.</li>
<li>Raised strong concerns about the continued structural and systemic abuse of Afghans’ economic, social, legal, political and cultural rights, recognised in the international conventions to which Afghanistan is a State Party, including rights of ethnic and religious minorities and groups; and noted that such violations and abuses include killings, arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, physical abuse, torture, and the shrinking space for civil society, freedom of peaceful assembly and of movement.</li>
<li>Specifically condemned violations and abuses of the rights of Afghan women and girls in the country, including restrictions on freedom of movement, as well as exclusion from political, economic, educational and social spaces, and acknowledging also that women and girls are disproportionally affected by the humanitarian and economic crisis in Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Expressed concern over restrictions on freedom of opinion and freedom of expression, notably through media crackdowns, the increasing restrictions on broadcasters, journalists and media workers, particularly restrictions on women working in the media, as well as unjust detentions of journalists, and the prohibition on some international media outlets within Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Raised the importance of a genuine and credible inclusive political process in Afghanistan with the meaningful participation of women and religious groups and minorities, that leads to national reconciliation and broad-based and representative governance; emphasised that an inclusive and representative government is crucial for lasting peace and stability in the country; and noted the importance of the Taliban engaging regularly with other political and civil society leaders in a sincere dialogue that leads to an inclusive political system in which the rights of all Afghans are respected.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li>Discussed additional ways to help the Afghan people in sustaining their livelihood by stabilizing the economy and increasing liquidity in the country, and particularly highlighted the necessity of the Taliban creating favourable conditions, including an enabling environment for stimulating investment and other economic activity by adherence to rule of law; made clear that the Taliban expanding the capability and professionalism of the Afghan Central Bank, free from political interference, will be an important step toward stabilisation of the financial sector; agreed to further explore ways of addressing the macro-economic and financial sector crisis in the country and to closely coordinate on this issue.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="10">
<li>Noted that the type and scope of future non-humanitarian development assistance to Afghanistan will be determined in large part by the Taliban’s actions and their upholding of the rights of all Afghans, particularly women, girls and members of minority groups.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="11">
<li>Underscored that the Taliban must fulfil their counterterrorism commitments as well as their commitments to counter drug production and trafficking and welcomed the Taliban’s recent decision to ban opium cultivation.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="12">
<li>Reaffirmed their expectations that the Taliban must allow safe, secure and orderly travel to and from Afghanistan, of both Afghans and foreign nationals, in full respect of freedom of movement and travel, policies to which the Taliban have committed in the past, as was highlighted in the UN Security Council Resolution 2593 (2021).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="13">
<li>Highlighted the need for the neighbours of Afghanistan, the countries of the region, other Muslim-majority countries and all international partners to cooperate in Afghanistan with the interest of the Afghan people in mind, in view of alleviating their humanitarian and economic situation, meeting their basic needs, and promoting their human rights.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="14">
<li>Welcomed the expanded role for the United Nations work in Afghanistan as spelled out in the Security Council Resolution 2626 (2022) renewing the mandate of UNAMA, and by the appointment by the Human Rights Council (HRC) of Richard Bennett as Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, and emphasised the importance of the United Nations, including the Special Rapporteur, having unhindered access throughout the territory of Afghanistan and to all Afghans.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="15">
<li>Expressed their appreciation to the European Union for organizing these consultations and hosting the meeting.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States, I extend best wishes to Roma everywhere on this special day when we celebrate the rich culture, language, heritage, and aspirations of Roma globally, including the generations of Romani Americans who have helped build and continue to enhance the United States.</p>
<p>We also recognize today that many of the world’s Roma continue to suffer from marginalization, systemic discrimination, statelessness, and violence. This treatment and exclusion prevent many Roma from reaching their full potential in political, social, and economic spheres. As Europe’s largest ethnic minority, we acknowledge the challenges experienced by Roma who have fled Ukraine in the face of President Putin’s unjustified and brutal attack on that country. In addition to the trauma of war, they must frequently cope with a lack of documentation and stigmatization along their evacuation routes.</p>
<p>The United States calls on all governments to uphold their international obligations, respect the human rights of all people, and provide equitable access to civil registration, housing, health care, and public services. We condemn bigotry in any form—including persistent anti-Roma bigotry—and underscore our support of the<em> Action Plan on Improving the Situation of Roma and Sinti within the OSCE Area</em>.</p>
<p>Every individual is born free and equal in dignity and rights, and the United States remains devoted to inclusion and equity for members of all races and ethnicities, both at home and abroad. To commemorate International Roma Day, we reaffirm this commitment to Roma throughout the world.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States and over 30 allies and partners across the world have levied the most impactful, coordinated, and wide-ranging economic restrictions in history in response to the Russian government&#8217;s war against Ukraine.  Today, we take additional actions to raise the economic cost on President Putin.  We are imposing blocking sanctions on two Russian state-owned enterprises:  Joint Stock Company United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC), as well as 28 USC subsidiaries and eight members of the USC board of directors; and Public Joint Stock Company Alrosa.</p>
<p>USC is one of Russia’s largest state-owned enterprises, and it developed and constructed the warships that have bombarded Ukraine’s cities.  Alrosa is a diamond-mining company, controlled by the Russian government, the proceeds of which help to finance the Russian government’s war and atrocities against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Our actions today, alongside the actions we have taken since the beginning of President Putin’s brutal and unjustified war in Ukraine, are designed to reinforce each other and intensify over time.  We remain committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and condemn Russia’s atrocities and disregard for life.  We support accountability for the Kremlin’s wrongdoing in this war of choice.  As long as the Kremlin continues its brutal assault on Ukraine and its people, we stand united with our allies and partners in imposing additional costs on Russia.</p>
<p>For more information on today’s action, please see the Department of the Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0707" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a> and the State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/additional-state-department-designations-targeting-russian-state-owned-defense-shipbuilding-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">fact sheet</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States welcomes the pledge by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to provide $2 billion in economic support for the Central Bank of Yemen, as well as the pledge by Saudi Arabia to provide $1 billion for development projects and fuel support. This economic support will help stabilize the economy, improve Yemenis’ access to basic services, and ease the economic crisis that causes so much suffering. The United States looks forward to working with regional, international, and private sector partners to strengthen the Yemeni economy.</p>
<p>At a time when funding gaps have forced humanitarians to cut life-saving assistance for millions of Yemenis, the United States also welcomes Saudi Arabia’s pledge to provide $300 million for the UN’s humanitarian response plan. We hope that this support reaches Yemenis in need as soon as possible. The Yemen humanitarian appeal remains less than forty percent funded, and the United States urges more donors to contribute generously and expeditiously to address the suffering of Yemenis.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>By suspending Russia from the UN Human Rights Council, countries around the world chose to hold Moscow to account today for gross and systematic violations of human rights in its premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war of choice against Ukraine.  We have seen growing evidence of Russia’s brutal disregard for international law and human rights in Ukraine, most notably in the death and devastation it has caused in communities such as Bucha, Irpin, and Mariupol.  The atrocities the world has witnessed appear to be further evidence of war crimes, which serves as another indication that Russia has no place in a body whose primary purpose is to promote respect for human rights.  As I said earlier today, today a wrong has been righted.</p>
<p>The world is sending another clear signal that Russia must immediately and unconditionally cease its war of aggression against Ukraine and honor the principles enshrined in the UN Charter.  The international community will continue to hold Russia to account, and the United States will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine as they fight for their sovereignty, democracy, and freedom.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States welcomes the announcement of the formation of a Presidential Leadership Council in Yemen. We support the aspirations of the Yemeni people for an effective, democratic, and transparent government that includes diverse political and civil society voices, including women and other marginalized groups. Most importantly, Yemenis deserve a government that protects rights and freedoms while promoting justice, accountability, and reconciliation.</p>
<p>The United States remains committed to helping advance a durable, inclusive resolution to the conflict in Yemen. We urge the Presidential Leadership Council to abide by the UN-negotiated truce and cooperate with comprehensive UN-led efforts to end the conflict.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>On behalf of Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs is soliciting public input for recommendations for this year’s Secretary of State’s Award for Corporate Excellence (ACE).  Now in its 23rd year, the ACE honors U.S. companies demonstrating leadership in their overseas operations, and whose operational practices and decision-making exemplify American values and international best practices.  Recommendations should be submitted to embassies and consulates by June 1, 2022.</p>
<p>For 2022, the ACE categories are:</p>
<p><b>Award for Corporate Excellence in Responsible Business Operations</b></p>
<p><i>This category recognizes a company’s commitment to upholding American values abroad in all its operations, including respecting human rights and labor rights, ethical supply chain management, and promoting democracy.  Candidate companies excelling in this field embrace core American values at home and abroad, including those emphasized during the Summit for Democracy.</i></p>
<p><strong>Award for Corporate Excellence in Climate Resilience</strong></p>
<p><em>This category recognizes a company’s commitment to using methods, investments, and approaches that enable its business and the communities in which it operates to adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis.  Candidate companies excelling in this field address shared climate challenges by contributing to global emissions monitoring, abatement, and adaption, and thus to global economic and human development.  Of particular focus is the candidate company’s efforts to implement solutions and initiatives to protect its own operations as well as communities from the impacts of the climate crisis.</em></p>
<p><strong>Award for Corporate Excellence in Inclusive Economic Growth</strong></p>
<p><em>This category recognizes companies that, through their business and outside efforts, emphasize equity and sustainable development in their host country, including through promoting sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, raising basic standards of living, and fostering social development.  Candidate companies excelling in this field promote American ideals and values such as equality and fairness and are taking concrete steps to ensure under-served populations are not being left out by the economy.  </em></p>
<p><strong>Details on Submitting a Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>ACE nominations are focused on the exemplary operations of a company in a specific country and nominations are officially put forward to the Secretary of State’s office by Chiefs of Mission from U.S. embassies and consulates.  As such, recommendations should be directed to a specific U.S. embassy or consulate for the operations of a U.S. firm in that country.</p>
<p>Stakeholders should contact the U.S. embassy or consulate switchboard during normal business hours and ask to speak with the economic section regarding the Award for Corporate Excellence.  Contact information can be obtained on the website of the respective embassy or consulate.  Chiefs of Mission will evaluate recommendations and determine which to send forward as nominations to the Secretary of State.  Stakeholders are asked to put forward recommendations to embassies and consulates for their consideration and should refrain from lobbying for a particular recommendation once it has been submitted.</p>
<p>Compelling recommendations will include proof of positive impact, particularly with metrics when available; show alignment of core business operations with the category for which the company is being nominated; and demonstrate commitment to the communities where a company does business.  Nominations of small-and-medium-sized firms are encouraged.</p>
