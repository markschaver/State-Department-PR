		<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, DC</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin Room</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, first let me say I’m just going to drop the microphone and leave it to these two, because who wants to follow that?  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>It is so wonderful to see everyone here.  And as Jessica said, there’s something wonderful about just being back in this room, in the Ben Franklin Room.  We haven’t had a chance to use it very much because of COVID in recent years, but to see it filled with all of you, to feel the energy in this room that you’re bringing to it, is a powerful thing.</p>
<p>And in some ways, it’s very appropriate that we’re here with Ben Franklin.  He was our nation’s first diplomat, as I think all of you know.  He charted the Gulf Stream, he pioneered electricity, he authored America’s first treaty, he helped forge a new ethos of self-government.  And virtually none of this did he do while sober.  (Laughter.)  So I know that’s not going to be an issue here tonight.</p>
<p>But first, Happy Pride, everyone.  (Cheers.)</p>
<p>As you’ve heard, this is our first in-person Pride reception in far too long – six years – and I’m thrilled that we’re finally able to do it, because Pride Month is all about love, authenticity, justice, equality, and those are very much worth celebrating.</p>
<p>Jessica, thank you for that introduction.  But mostly, thank you for your tireless efforts already as our special envoy to stand up for the rights of LGBTQI+ persons around the world, to tackle discrimination and violence wherever we find it.</p>
<p>We spent some time together this week.  I would not want to be in the way of Jessica Stern.  (Applause.)  I’m so glad that I’m on her team.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>And I also want to say a few words about a few other people.  Uzra Zeya – Uzra, are you here somewhere?  There.  (Applause.)  Uzra, as I think most of you know, is our under secretary of state for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, and she is leading our efforts to defend rights around the world, including for LGBTQI+ persons.</p>
<p>And Michael, thank you, thank you, thank you for your extraordinary leadership of glifaa.  You’ve done a remarkable job.  We’re very, very pleased that you’re now off on a mission very soon to Luxembourg, but to you, to everyone from glifaa’s board and membership who is here, thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>We’re here tonight because, first and foremost, Pride Month is about supporting and celebrating LGBTQI+ persons everywhere, including in the workplace.  And simply put, we wouldn’t be able to do our work without you – and we wouldn’t want to.  You’re dedicated public servants, incredibly talented diplomats, cherished colleagues and teammates.  You make our country safer; you make our foreign policy stronger.  And we want to do everything we can to make sure that this department, the State Department, always recognizes your worth, supports you and your families, and is a place where you can bring your whole self to work every single day.</p>
<p>Now, to do that, we need to be honest about the work it’s taken to get where we are today, and you’ve heard reference to some of it.  For a long time, LGBTQI+ people couldn’t live openly and still get a State Department security clearance.  In contrast – in contrast – this week and this weekend, Diplomatic Security agents marched with glifaa in the DC Pride Parade.  (Applause.)  That in and of itself is a pretty remarkable journey.  And it’s thanks in large part to glifaa, and to all the people who stood up and fought for America’s foreign affairs agencies to be better.  That took courage.  It took resilience.  And it’s achieved real results.</p>
<p>But again, as you’ve heard, there’s still a lot of work to do.  The work is ongoing, and in a sense, it always will be.  We can’t ever become complacent in advancing equity in our workplace.  And especially now, it is so critical that we reaffirm our shared commitment to an America where all people are treated with equal respect and equal humanity, and where all kids know that they’re perfect just the way they are.  (Applause.)  At the same time, we’re also working very closely with glifaa to see to it that when an LGBTQI+ officer serves overseas, they can do so with their partner.  That is a priority for me and for all of us.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>So we here at State have another responsibility as well.  It is our job – and it’s quite literally Jessica’s job – to stand up for human rights all over the world.  And the fact is, again, as you’ve heard, the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons are vulnerable or actively violated in far too many places.  Homosexual status or conduct is still illegal in 70 countries around the world.  That’s about a third of the world’s countries.  In some, it’s punishable by death.  And in too much of the world, being lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, or simply gender non-conforming means that you’re going to be dealing with violence, you’re going to be dealing with harassment, targeted by the police or security forces, denied education, denied employment, denied equal access to the justice sector or to healthcare, experiencing profoundly isolating social exclusion.</p>
<p>These are human rights abuses – and the United States fights for human rights.  Human rights are indivisible.  Whenever one group of people is targeted, all vulnerable groups are less safe.  And whenever one group’s rights are protected, societies as a whole become both more free, more prosperous, more secure.  This is the “inescapable network of mutuality” that Dr. Martin Luther King talked about when he said that “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”  That’s why it’s not just enough to stand up for LGBTQI rights at home. We have to continue and we will continue to stand up for equal rights everywhere, in partnership with local activists and local communities.</p>
<p>Human rights are also central to our support for democracy around the world, because any system in which some groups are treated as “less than” – as second-class citizens with fewer rights and protections – is fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>Wednesday, as you heard, President Biden signed an executive order to advance LGBTQI+ equality at home and abroad that includes direction to this department, to the State Department, along with other relevant agencies, to develop a plan to promote an end to the profoundly harmful and medically discredited practice of so-called “conversion therapy” around the world and to ensure that our foreign – (applause) – and to ensure, to ensure, that our foreign assistance dollars do not fund it.</p>
<p>At the Human Rights Council, we are supporting renewing the mandate of the Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity for another three years, so that this vital work to protect people facing violence and discrimination continues.</p>
<p>We’ll keep supporting marriage equality and legal recognition for same-sex relationships around the world.</p>
<p>And this year, we’re celebrating the 10th anniversary of the State Department’s Global Equality Fund.  With support from Congress, from other countries, private sector partners, we have provided more than $100 million to LGBTQI+ organizations in more than 100 countries.  (Cheers.)</p>
<p>We will continue to find ways to advance this work around the world.  And I have a pretty good feeling I can count on everyone in this room to help us do that – (laughter) – because many of you have been pushing us to do more and to do better for a long time.</p>
<p>So as Mike noted at the outset, this is the 30th anniversary of glifaa’s founding.  I think probably all of you know the backstory, but for the few of you who don’t:  David Buss was a Foreign Service officer.  He was posted to the Seychelles.  David Larson was there with the Peace Corps.  They became great friends.  Eventually, they fell in love.</p>
<p>As a result, David Larson was removed from the Peace Corps for his, quote, “inappropriate lifestyle.”  David Buss learned that the State Department was investigating him because of his sexuality.  He also learned that other people at State and USAID were going through the same ordeal.</p>
<p>So the two Davids invited some of those colleagues over for brunch one weekend back in 1992.  They included Bryan Dalton, Danny Hall, Jan Krc, Eric Nelson, John Schneider.  That’s how glifaa was born.</p>
<p>This story reminds us that powerful moments are often rooted in necessity, but also – also – in love, in friendship – and sometimes brunch.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>It’s a story about who we were but also who we’ve become.</p>
<p>And I just want to thank everyone who has courageously carried forward that legacy, the legacy that glifaa’s founders began all those years ago.  We will continue to march together.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)</p>

		<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>On Monday, June 20, representatives from the United States and twenty-eight other governments, along with non-governmental organizations, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, academia, refugees, and the private sector will convene the Annual Tripartite Consultations on Resettlement (ATCR) in Geneva, Switzerland. The three-day ATCR is a high-level, multilateral forum to discuss and advance refugee resettlement issues of common interest.</p>
<p>The 2022 ATCR is chaired by the Government of the United States, represented by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) and co-chaired by Refugee Council USA (RCUSA). Interagency representatives from the U.S. Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services and the White House will be in attendance. This will be the first in-person ATCR event since 2019 and the first time the U.S. has chaired since 2011. The first day of the ATCR, June 20, also coincides with World Refugee Day. Secretary Blinken will address the delegates by video, highlighting renewed U.S. leadership on refugee resettlement.</p>
<p>The ATCR allows existing and emerging resettlement countries to share best practices, discuss priorities, and engage with resettlement stakeholders on global needs and opportunities for the upcoming year. The event will emphasize strengthening partnerships and increasing capacity for resettlement, complementary protection pathways, and integration of refugees into welcoming and inclusive societies. As a global leader in refugee resettlement, the United States will outline plans at the ATCR to not only restore the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, but also expand and modernize it. The theme of this year’s ATCR is Reemerging and Building Globally.</p>
<p>Throughout the ATCR, the focus will be on reemerging from a year of unprecedented humanitarian emergencies such as Afghanistan and Ukraine, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic through renewed commitments to increased resettlement and complementary pathways, more innovative and nimble responses to emerging crises, and more equitable responsibility-sharing for supporting refugees globally.

<p>On Monday, June 20, representatives from the United States and twenty-eight other governments, along with non-governmental organizations, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, academia, refugees, and the private sector will convene the Annual Tripartite Consultations on Resettlement (ATCR) in Geneva, Switzerland. The three-day ATCR is a high-level, multilateral forum to discuss and advance refugee resettlement issues of common interest.</p>
<p>The 2022 ATCR is chaired by the Government of the United States, represented by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) and co-chaired by Refugee Council USA (RCUSA). Interagency representatives from the U.S. Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services and the White House will be in attendance. This will be the first in-person ATCR event since 2019 and the first time the U.S. has chaired since 2011. The first day of the ATCR, June 20, also coincides with World Refugee Day. Secretary Blinken will address the delegates by video, highlighting renewed U.S. leadership on refugee resettlement.</p>
<p>The ATCR allows existing and emerging resettlement countries to share best practices, discuss priorities, and engage with resettlement stakeholders on global needs and opportunities for the upcoming year. The event will emphasize strengthening partnerships and increasing capacity for resettlement, complementary protection pathways, and integration of refugees into welcoming and inclusive societies. As a global leader in refugee resettlement, the United States will outline plans at the ATCR to not only restore the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, but also expand and modernize it. The theme of this year’s ATCR is Reemerging and Building Globally.</p>

<p>The Ortega-Murillo regime for years has chipped away at Nicaragua’s democratic institutions and, along with a small circle of enablers, has allowed corruption and impunity to reign. Nicaragua is increasingly deepening its relationship with Russia as it turns its back on the Nicaraguan people.</p>
<p>Today, the United States took additional actions to promote accountability for the Ortega-Murillo regime’s attacks on civil liberties and democracy.  The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on Nicaraguan state-owned mining company ENIMINAS and the president of its board of directors, Ruy Delgado Lopez.  The Nicaraguan National Assembly’s 2017 creation of ENIMINAS increased the government’s involvement in the mining sector, notably gold mining.  The Ortega-Murillo regime promotes the gold mining industry, driving profits to its allies in the private sector and increasing ENIMINAS revenues that are managed by senior figures in the ruling party. As the Ortega-Murillo regime continues to isolate itself by repressing Nicaragua’s democracy and Nicaraguans’ human rights, it finds itself moving closer to other authoritarian nations like Russia.</p>
<p>On November 7, 2021, following months of repression and the imprisonment of more than 40 democratic leaders, including seven potential presidential candidates, opposition members, journalists, students and members of civil society, the Ortega-Murillo regime stole an election that denied Nicaraguans their ability to choose their own government.  By declaring victory after the fraudulent election, the regime entrenched itself in power and established a dynastic dictatorship similar to the Somoza regime, which the Sandinistas overthrew more than 40 years ago.  In the months that have followed, the Ortega-Murillo regime has closed over 500 non-governmental organizations and universities and refused to release the more than 180 political prisoners who remain unjustly detained.</p>
<p>With these new sanctions, the United States adds its voice to the international condemnation of the Ortega-Murillo regime’s malign behavior.  The United States joins the regional calls for a return to democracy in Nicaragua and will continue to use the diplomatic and economic tools available to us to promote accountability for the Ortega-Murillo regime.  We call again for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners.</p>

<p>Just days after they returned home from a year-long study abroad as part of the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange (CBYX), Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will deliver remarks to 350 American high school, vocational, and young professional program participants at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, June 21, 2022.  The Secretary will be joined by Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs Lee Satterfield.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken will speak to the CBYX alumni about the importance of citizen diplomacy, youth empowerment, and the role of the CBYX program in advancing the U.S.-Germany partnership and transatlantic relations.  The event will provide a forum for young citizen ambassadors who represent the diversity of the United States to reflect on their CBYX experience, discuss its impact, and strategize how to share their experiences in their home communities across nearly 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>CBYX is an immersive exchange program jointly offered by the U.S. and German governments. It offers opportunities to study or work abroad for high school students, recent high school graduates with a vocational interest, and young professionals.  CBYX provides a crucial thread in the people-to-people ties between the United States and Germany.</p>

<p>Just days after they returned home from a year-long study abroad as part of the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange (CBYX), Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will deliver remarks to 350 American high school, vocational, and young professional program participants at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, June 21, 2022.  The Secretary will be joined by Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs Lee Satterfield.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken will speak to the CBYX alumni about the importance of citizen diplomacy, youth empowerment, and the role of the CBYX program in advancing the U.S.-Germany partnership and transatlantic relations.  The event will provide a forum for young citizen ambassadors who represent the diversity of the United States to reflect on their CBYX experience, discuss its impact, and strategize how to share their experiences in their home communities across nearly 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>CBYX is an immersive exchange program jointly offered by the U.S. and German governments. It offers opportunities to study or work abroad for high school students, recent high school graduates with a vocational interest, and young professionals.  CBYX provides a crucial thread in the people-to-people ties between the United States and Germany.</p>
<p>The remarks will be available via livestream on <a title="Original URL: https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA2MTcuNTk1NzI4NjEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlLmdvdiJ9.X5JUury-Wfe3yz1u7ZMiim45L6tEt2siw_w3qyyJmeM/s/1436012980/br/133266815191-l.

		<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, DC</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, good morning, everyone.  It’s a pleasure to be able to receive my colleague and my friend, the foreign minister of Senegal.  Welcome, Aïssata, to the State Department.  I had a wonderful visit where we spent a lot of time together in Senegal.  We’ve had many conversations since then.</p>
<p>And our two countries are strong partners on so many issues based on many shared values.  I’m looking forward to continuing the discussions that we started in Dakar last November and things that we’ve been working on since, including at the United Nations.  I think we’ll talk about the ways that we can address the growing food security crisis that has been exacerbated by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.  This is a very important topic for both of us and for many countries around the world, and we’ve been working concretely on how to address it both in the near term and the longer term.</p>
<p>Senegal, of course, has been a leader on trying to end the acute phase of COVID-19 and more broadly on global health security.  We’ll be talking about that.  And of course, we’re partners on security cooperation, on economic prosperity, on dealing with climate change and on resolving regional issues.</p>
<p>So there is, as always, a broad agenda, but I’m just particularly pleased to be able to reciprocate for the incredibly warm hospitality but also the incredibly productive visit that I had with you and with President Macky Sall.</p>
<p>Aïssata, welcome.  Over to you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER TALL SALL:</strong>  Thanks you so much, Secretary of State.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter)  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell you how delighted I am, me and my delegation, to have this working visit at the State Department, invited by the Secretary of State Mr. Blinken, who, as you reminded us, in last November you were in Dakar in order to strengthen further this wonderful relationship of cooperation between the United States and Senegal.</p>
<p>Our cooperation is a historical cooperation.  It is based on political values, human values, moral values which are our own and which are shared – democratic values, values of respect for human rights, fundamental values – freedom, freedom of thought, freedom of acting, freedom to assemble, to choose our political orientation and choose one’s religion, which we respect in Senegal just as is respected wonderfully in the United States.</p>
<p>This already is what’s at the basis of the construction of this relationship which is ours.  And I was telling the Secretary of State Mr. Blinken last November in Dakar that all secretaries of state of the United States made a visit to Dakar, but his own visit was historical because it was in a double context.  The first context is that we had not overcome the pandemic, and he decided in spite of these constraints to come visit to Senegal.  This is something that the President Macky Sall, the Government of Senegal, were very much appreciated by the government.</p>
<p>And the second context is that Senegal was the only French-speaking country to benefit from this very first secretary – visit of the Secretary of State Mr. Blinken in Africa.  To us this was a very strong message, a message of friendship but also a message which indicates that we need to work side by side to meet all the challenges that are shaking the world.  You – he said it.  There’s this crisis in Ukraine.  We’ll talk about it once again.  How can we cooperate further?</p>
<p>Senegal very much appreciated the United States’ support in the fight against COVID-19 as part of COVAX, but also all of the initiatives carried out currently by President Biden to position the world towards democracy and the fight against COVID-19.</p>
<p>And at these very summits – the Summit for Democracy online, everywhere – Senegal was there.  Senegal benefitted at all times of this cooperation and of all of the economic initiatives launched by the United States on behalf of the entire world.  USAID is in our country for a very long time, but before that the Peace Corps was already there in 1963, and after that AGOA, and after that MCC, and after that, now today, DPW and then DFC, and after that, and so on and so on.  So this is the status of our cooperation at the economic level, alongside our political commitments, alongside the Government of the United States, because we do share the same values that I just mentioned.</p>
<p>That’s why, dear Antony, I am very happy to see you once again this morning and to have this working meeting to establish once again a new landmark that will be written in the historical books.  I’ve just signed the guest book, and I said this is a very long road, but on a periodical – once in a while each actor will play their part.  And today it’s you for the United States, and myself, humbly, on behalf of Senegal, I do know that we’ll write many more beautiful pages to further deepen the cooperation between our two countries, which are friends.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

		<p>The following text was released by the Governments of the United States of America and the European Union.</p>
<p>Today, the United States, the European Union, and 11 countries launched the Global Methane Pledge Energy Pathway to catalyze methane emissions reductions in the oil and gas sector, advancing both climate progress and energy security.</p>
<p>To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C and avoid near-term tipping points, the world must rapidly reduce methane emissions in addition to decarbonizing the global energy sector. This is why the United States, the European Union, and more than 100 countries launched the Global Methane Pledge (GMP) at COP26 to reduce anthropogenic methane emissions at least 30 percent by 2030 from 2020 levels. With the recent additions of Egypt, Kosovo, Moldova, Oman, Qatar, Saint Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Uzbekistan, 120 countries have now endorsed the Pledge, representing half of global methane emissions and nearly three-quarters of the global economy.</p>
<p>Tackling methane emissions in the oil and gas sector is critical to achieving the Global Methane Pledge target—and will also bolster global energy security by preventing the needless waste of valuable gas resources. The oil and gas sector contributes roughly one-quarter of all anthropogenic methane emissions due to flaring, venting, and leaking of methane, which is the principal component of natural gas. Globally, more than 250 bcm of natural gas was flared, vented, or leaked in 2021—exceeding the annual output of the world’s third-largest gas producer. Reducing flaring and methane emissions in the oil and gas sector is immediately cost-effective and has the triple benefit of acting on climate change, improving health outcomes, and enhancing global gas supply at existing levels of production—simply by capturing gas that would otherwise be wasted due to flaring or methane emissions.</p>
<p>The Energy Pathway is a critical implementation step of the Global Methane Pledge that will accelerate deployment of the fastest and most cost-effective methane mitigation solutions available today. The GMP Energy Pathway aims to encourage all nations to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Capture the maximum potential of cost-effective methane mitigation in the oil and gas sector, and</li>
<li>Eliminate routine flaring as soon as possible, and no later than 2030.</li>
</ul>
<p>Participating countries commit to support these efforts by providing new technical and financial resources and/or by enhancing domestic project and policy action.</p>
<p>According to an International Energy Agency report released this week, deploying all available abatement technologies to reduce methane emissions and flaring from the oil and gas sector can avoid nearly 0.1 degree C of warming by mid-century—the equivalent of immediately eliminating the greenhouse gas footprint of all cars, trucks, buses, and two- and three-wheelers in the world.</p>
<p>Today, Argentina, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, and Oman joined the United States and the European Union as inaugural members of the Pathway. Malaysia&#8217;s national oil company, PETRONAS, supports the Global Methane Pledge Energy Pathway and other regional and global methane management initiatives towards achieving the intent of the Global Methane Pledge. Together, the participants in the Pathway account for two-fifths of global gas production and three-fifths of global gas imports.</p>
<p><strong>Countries and supporting organizations announced nearly $60 million in dedicated funding to support implementation of the Pathway.</strong></p>
<p>Countries and supporting organizations have announced $59 million in dedicated funding and in-kind assistance in support of the GMP Energy Pathway that was announced at today’s MEF, including:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>$4 million</strong> to support the <strong>World Bank Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR)</strong>. The United States intends to support the transfer by the World Bank of at least $1.5 million in funding to the GGFR. <strong>Germany</strong> intends to provide $1.5 million, and <strong>Norway</strong> intends to provide approximately $1 million to GGFR.</li>
<li><strong>$5.5 million</strong> to support the <strong>Global Methane Initiative (GMI)</strong>. The <strong>United States</strong> will provide $3.5 million. Guided by the recommendations of the GMI, <strong>Canada</strong> will contribute $2 million over the next four years, as part of its global climate finance commitment, to support methane mitigation projects in developing countries including in the oil and gas sector.</li>
<li>Up to <strong>$9.5 million</strong> from the UNEP <strong>International Methane Emissions Observatory</strong> to support scientific assessments of methane emissions and mitigation potential in the oil and gas sector that are aligned with the Global Methane Pledge Energy Pathway.</li>
<li>Up to <strong>$40 million</strong> annually from the philanthropic <strong>Global Methane Hub</strong> to support methane mitigation in the fossil energy sector.</li>
</ul>
<p>These funds will be critical to improve methane measurements in the oil and gas sector, identify priority areas for methane mitigation, develop technical assessments for project development, strengthen regulator and operator capacity, support policy development and enforcement, and other essential activities to achieve reductions in methane emissions.</p>
<p>In addition, the <strong>UNEP International Methane Emissions Observatory</strong> will work with partners to launch the first phase of an alert and response system for satellite-detected methane emissions by COP27. The EU has so far committed 17 million EUR to support the work of the UNEP International Methane Emissions Observatory and has envisaged further funding in the coming months.</p>
<p>The <strong>Climate and Clean Air Coalition</strong> will also support the goals of the Pathway through its Hub on Fossil Energy to reduce methane and other short-lived climate pollutant mitigation in this sector.</p>
<p><strong>Global gas producers announced significant new commitments to develop projects and strengthen policies to cut methane emissions and ensure clean, secure gas supply.</strong></p>
<p>Domestically, the <strong>United States</strong> is continuing its progress on reducing oil and gas methane emissions across the value chain, supporting American gas companies in cutting emissions and saving consumer costs. Building upon the new source performance standards and emissions guidelines proposed in November 2021, the <strong>Environmental Protection Agency</strong> will issue a supplemental proposed rule for public comment in 2022 to reduce methane and other air emissions from new and existing oil and gas facilities. The <strong>Department of Interior</strong> will be proposing new regulations to reduce the wasteful flaring and venting of gas produced on public lands. The <strong>Department of Transportation</strong> is putting in place a comprehensive set of safety-related regulations that will reduce or eliminate methane emissions from gas pipeline systems that stretch from production-related gathering lines, through trunk line transmission pipelines, and into local distribution pipelines. In addition, new funding provided under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is enabling the Department of Transportation to spend $1 billion on replacing unsafe and leaking gas distribution pipelines.</p>
<p>The <strong>United States</strong> also intends to take the steps necessary to rejoin the World Bank Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Mexico</strong> and <strong>PEMEX</strong> will advance, with an investment of close to $2 billion of its own resources and international credits at special rates, a comprehensive assessment and implementation of projects and actions translating into a reduction of between 86 percent and 100 percent of methane gas emissions in gas exploration, production and processing processes by 2024. Mexico joins the United States and the rest of the countries adhering to the proposals for energy implementation of the Global Methane Pledge Energy Pathway to eradicate flaring and methane emissions in the oil and gas sector.</p>
<p><strong>Argentina</strong> committed to present its National Climate Action Plan 2030 at COP27 including specific measures that will lead to the limitation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, the reinforced control of flaring and venting, and an increase of the share of renewable energy in its electricity generation mix.</p>
<p><strong>Nigeria</strong> announced its intention to publish methane regulations in the oil and gas sector by COP27.</p>
<p><strong>Canada</strong> is developing a national methane strategy, which will build on commitments to reduce oil and gas methane by at least 75 percent below 2012 levels by 2030. Canada is also proud to be one of the founding partners and a top donor to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, recently contributing an additional $10 million over 5 years to support the Coalition as it enters its next phase. In addition, Canada has also invested $20 million in GHGSat which uses high-tech satellites to detect and quantify methane emissions from point sources as small as individual oil and gas wells.</p>
<p><strong>PETRONAS</strong>, Malaysia’s national oil company, reaffirmed its endorsement of the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 Initiative and pledges to avoid routine flaring in new oil field developments and end routine flaring at existing oil production sites by 2030. It continues to assess opportunities to help strengthen policies and regulations for flaring and oil and gas methane reductions, and to cooperate with global partners on best practices for measurement, reporting, and verification of oil and gas methane emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Egypt</strong> joined the Global Methane Pledge with regards to the oil and gas sector, under the Energy Pathway, which will provide resources and support for flare capture, methane reductions, and clean energy expansion in Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>Egypt, Israel, and the EU</strong> have concluded a trilateral agreement on June 15 on natural gas, in which they declare their intention to promote the reduction of methane leakages, and in particular, examine new technologies for reducing venting and flaring and explore possibilities for the utilization of captured methane throughout the entire supply chain.</p>
<p><strong>Major consumers of natural gas announced efforts to reduce the methane emissions associated with gas production and consumption.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>EU</strong> and the <strong>Government of Japan</strong> will endeavor to reduce the methane emissions from the entire value chain of oil and gas production and consumption, including by promoting appropriate international monitoring, reporting, and verification standards; by providing technical assistance and investment for methane emissions reduction along the fossil fuel value chain; and by supporting lower-GHG emissions oil and gas production and consumption.</p>
<p>The <strong>EU</strong> is committed to implementing the UN Oil and Gas Methane Partnership in domestic law.</p>
<p>The <strong>United States</strong> and <strong>EU</strong> reaffirmed their commitment to cooperate on a common tool for life cycle analysis of methane emissions for hydrocarbon suppliers through the U.S.-EU Energy Council that will advance global efforts to move toward improved consistency and accuracy of the measurement, reporting, and verification of greenhouse gas emissions from the production of hydrocarbons and support improved reporting on methane in national greenhouse gas inventories.</p>
<p><strong>Germany</strong> also announced its participation in the World Bank Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Methane mitigation in the oil and gas sector is a necessary complement to renewable energy expansion in advancing global climate progress and supporting energy security.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions across the fossil fuel supply chain, the world must also accelerate renewables deployment and energy efficiency to reduce reliance on volatile fossil fuels. The clean energy transition is the ultimate energy security solution by reducing dependence on volatile fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency and energy saving has a vital role in addressing today’s climate change crisis and spike in energy prices, while strengthening energy security by decreasing price and demand pressures on global energy markets. The International Energy Agency estimates that improvements in efficiency, accelerated deployment of renewables, and other clean energy solutions can free up 350 bcm of natural gas by 2025—exceeding the annual gas consumption of all of Africa and Central and South America.</p>
<p>Rapid renewables deployment can also help alleviate global gas supply shortages by offsetting gas consumption in sectors where alternatives are easily available. Specifically, in gas-producing countries, renewables expansion can reduce domestic gas consumption and free up gas for export at today’s high market prices.</p>
