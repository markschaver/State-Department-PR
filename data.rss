					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The text of the following statement was released by the Governments of the United States of America and the United Arab Emirates.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin Text:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Eighth U.S.-UAE Economic Policy Dialogue on June 8 was co-chaired by the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation’s Assistant Minister for Economic and Trade Affairs HE Abdulnasser Alshaali and Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs Peter Haas to further develop bilateral ties and solidify the economic partnership between the two countries.  The dialogue was opened by Ambassador Marcia Bernicat, Senior Official for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, and Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Joey Hood.  The Deputy Chief of Mission of the UAE Embassy to the United States Shaima Gargash also participated along with numerous officials from both governments.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the discussions, both countries reaffirmed their desire to expand engagement and pursue new health research, space program, environmental, and commercial opportunities.  Despite the challenges embodied by the current global health situation, both sides applauded the convening of the event with significant in-person participation and emphasized their shared commitment to maintain open and regular communication.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two delegations confirmed that the U.S.-UAE economic relationship remains close and constructive, with the UAE maintaining its position as the United States’ largest trading partner in the Middle East and North Africa for the twelfth year in a row.  They highlighted a number of achievements with respect to women’s economic empowerment, cooperation on economic and social development initiatives, the effectiveness of anti-money laundering and the counter-financing of terrorism policies, improvements in intellectual property protections, and positive developments in the investment climate.  They also commended the historic signing of the Abraham Accords in September 2020.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States and the UAE also committed to exploring new and expanding existing cooperation in a range of areas, including, climate change and the environment, global health security and health care research, space, the digital economy and emerging technologies, the prevention of financial crime, and women’s economic empowerment.  Upon conclusion of the meeting, the U.S. and the UAE delegations reiterated their desire to work closely and collaboratively in promoting bilateral cooperation, identifying avenues for regional partnerships, and seeking new opportunities for positive engagement.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, the UAE and United States partnered to form the Economic Policy Dialogue, which serves as an annual platform for both governments to promote bilateral trade and investment and to facilitate a more cooperative business environment.   </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States is committed to ensuring the stability and security of the Western Balkans, allowing countries in the region to fulfill their potential as free and prosperous democracies. We are also committed to combatting corruption and demonstrating the advantages of transparent and accountable governance.  The United States recognizes that corruption threatens economic equity, global anti-poverty and development efforts, and democracy itself.  Corruption anywhere directly damages the foreign policy, national security, and economic health of the United States and our partners and allies.  That is why we are committed to promoting accountability and combating impunity for those involved in significant corruption in the Western Balkans and throughout the world.</p>
<p>In furtherance of this commitment, President Biden issued today an Executive Order (E.O.) that builds on and expands previous E.O.s, modernizing the Western Balkans sanctions regime by including references to the 2018 Prespa Agreement and the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals.  Additionally, the new E.O. provides for sanctions against persons whose actions destabilize the region by undermining democratic institutions and the rule of law or by violating human rights. To best address region-wide networks of corruption, Albania has been added to the scope of the E.O.</p>
<p>The E.O. also authorizes the imposition of sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for corruption in the region, including misappropriation of public assets, expropriation of private assets for personal gain or political purposes, or bribery. All property and interests in property of persons designated pursuant to this E.O. that are or come within the United States or the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.  In addition, individuals sanctioned under this E.O. are not eligible to enter the United States and are not eligible for a U.S. visa.</p>
<p>Our commitment to promoting democracy, transparency, and accountability, across the Western Balkans is both unwavering and consistent with the standards the countries of the region must meet to secure their goals of advancing on the European path.</p>

<p align="left">Our ocean covers more than 70 percent of the Earth’s surface, supports billions of livelihoods worldwide, and provides more than half the oxygen we breathe.  The United States has set a goal of conserving 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030.  Efforts to expand marine protected areas are an important part of meeting that goal, as they are an essential tool that can help protect biodiversity and habitats, support fisheries, capture and store carbon, and build ocean resilience. We must also address the ocean plastic pollution crisis.  The United States looks forward to working with countries as we consider global action.</p>
<p align="left">The climate crisis is also an ocean crisis. The ocean has absorbed 20 to 30 percent of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions since the 1980s, and more than 90 percent of the Earth’s warming over the past 50 years has occurred in the ocean.  Sea level rise, ocean acidification, coral bleaching, storm and flood damage, change in abundance and distribution of marine species, and biodiversity loss are just some of the effects of greenhouse gas pollution on the ocean, imperiling communities worldwide.</p>
<p align="left">Protecting our ocean also means fighting illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which costs the world tens of billions of dollars each year.  The United States actively supports efforts to combat the threat that IUU fishing poses to the livelihoods of coastal communities.  IUU fishing operations may also be linked to criminal activities such as money laundering, drug trafficking, and human trafficking, including forced labor.  The United States champions building cooperative, science-based rules to ensure that these fisheries can be sustainable for the long term, helping to work together with countries around the world towards our shared goals.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  There we go.  Mr. Chairman, Vice Chairman Shelby, Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, all the committee members, thank you very much for coming together today and giving me this opportunity to talk about the administration’s proposed budget and how we believe it will help us achieve our national security priorities and deliver results for the American people, which is our common mission.</p>
<p>Let me just say that the last time I had the honor of actually appearing before the subcommittee, and Senator Graham will remember this, I had – was seated next to another witness who seemed to get a lot more attention: Bono.  (Laughter.)  So a very, very memorable day before the subcommittee, but Senator Coons, Senator Graham, very much looking forward to working with you going forward as well.</p>
<p>This is a critical moment for the United States and for our global leadership.  We have major tests, including stopping COVID-19; rising to the challenge of the climate crisis; supporting a global economic recovery that delivers for American workers and families; we have to revitalize our alliances and partnerships; outcompete China and defend the international rules-based order against those who seek to undermine it; renew democratic values at home and abroad; and push back against malign activity by our adversaries.</p>
<p>In a more competitive world, other countries are making historic investments in their foreign policy toolkit.  We need to do the same thing.  That’s why in this budget we proposed $58.5 billion for the State Department and USAID for Fiscal Year 2022.  And just to cover some of the specifics, this budget will strengthen global health.  The United States has been a leader in this field for decades – in Africa, around the world.  We’re asking for $10 billion for global health programs, including nearly $1 billion for global health security to help us prevent, prepare for, respond to future global health crises so we can stop outbreaks before they turn into pandemics that put our safety and prosperity in danger.</p>
<p>The budget will accelerate the global response to the climate crisis by providing $2.5 billion for international climate programs, including 1.25 billion to the Green Climate Fund to help developing countries implement climate adaptation and emissions mitigation programs, which is directly in our interest.</p>
<p>The budget will double down on the fight for democracy, which, as we all know, is under threat in many places around the world.  People talk of a democratic recession around the world.  Our budget request includes $2.8 billion in foreign assistance to advance human rights, fight corruption, stem the tide of democratic backsliding, and strengthen and defend democracies – for example, through technical training for elections and support for independent media and civil society.  It also requests $300 million for the National Endowment for Democracy.</p>
<p>The budget will support a comprehensive strategy to address the root causes of irregular migration from Central America.  It will invest 861 million in the region as a first step toward a four-year commitment of $4 billion to help prevent violence, reduce poverty, curtail endemic corruption, and expand job and educational opportunities.</p>
<p>The budget would re-establish U.S. humanitarian leadership with a request of $10 billion in assistance to support refugees, victims of conflict, other displaced people, and to rebuild our refugee admissions program.</p>
<p>It will support our partners in the Middle East by fully funding our commitments to key countries, including Israel and Jordan, and by restoring humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>It includes a budget request of 3.6 billion to pay our assessed contributions in full to international organizations, initiatives, peacekeeping efforts, including to restore our annual contributions to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>As China and others work hard to bend international organizations to their worldview, we have to ensure that these organizations instead remain grounded in the values, principles, and rules of the road that have made our shared progress possible for so many decades.</p>
<p>Finally, to deliver in all of these areas, the budget will reinvest in our most vital asset, and that’s our people.  It will provide new resources to recruit, to train, and to retain a first-rate, diverse global workforce, with nearly 500 additional Foreign and Civil Service positions – the largest increase for State Department staffing, excuse me, in a decade.  And it will modernize our technology – cybersecurity – protect our embassies and consulates, and include a direct appropriation of $320 million for consular services worldwide so that we can continue to provide these vital services to Americans and those who seek to study, to travel, to do business with the United States.</p>
<p>Our national security depends not only on the strength of our armed forces, but also our ability to conduct effective diplomacy and development.  That’s how we solve global challenges, forge cooperation, advance our interests and values, protect our people, prevent crises overseas from becoming emergencies here at home.  And that’s why diplomacy and development are smart investments for American taxpayers.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice Chairman, a top priority for me as Secretary is to restore the traditional role of Congress as a partner in our foreign policymaking.  That’s the spirit that I bring to today’s conversation, the spirit I’ll bring to all future conversations and engagements with this committee, and I’m grateful for the chance to answer your questions.  Thank you very much.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p align="left">Today’s decision from the United Nations International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals affirming the conviction of Ratko Mladic on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes brings a measure of long-awaited justice to victims and their families in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p align="left">As the former Commander of the Bosnian Serb Army, Mladic was a key figure in a campaign with the horrifying objective to permanently remove the Bosniak and Croat populations of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Serb-controlled territory.  The crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina mark one of the darkest chapters of history following the Second World War.</p>
<p align="left">Despite efforts of perpetrators to silence witnesses, keep evidence of their crimes buried, and evade warrants of arrest, justice has prevailed in this case. We commend the courage and resilience of survivors and their loved ones who have continued to fight for the official acknowledgment of these crimes.  As we approach the 26th anniversary of the genocide at Srebrenica, we hope the verdict of the Appeals Chamber brings a measure of peace to the victims and their loved ones.  We are grateful for the years of work by the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals in carrying out justice in this case.</p>
<p align="left">The United States will continue to press for justice, mutual trust, and reconciliation as the foundation for peace and stability.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Since the January 28, 2021 Presidential Memorandum on Protecting Women’s Health at Home and Abroad, the United States has been re-engaging with UNFPA in support of its essential work to address preventable maternal deaths and the unmet need for family planning, and prevent and respond to gender-based violence and harmful practices around the world.  Our re-engagement directly benefits communities around the globe, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Some of the efforts that have taken place or are currently underway include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revitalizing High-Level Engagement: On June 7, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield met with UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalie Kanem.  This meeting represents the top-level U.S. government commitment to rebuilding U.S. support for UNFPA, implementing the directive of the January 28 Presidential Memorandum to advance sexual and reproductive health and rights.</li>
<li>Restoring Core Funding: The U.S. Department of State is taking the necessary steps to provide $30.8 million to UNFPA in Fiscal Year 2021.</li>
<li>Responding to the Rohingya Refugee Crisis: Some $2.6 million of the nearly $155 million in U.S. humanitarian assistance announced on May 18, 2021 will support UNFPA operations in responding to this crisis.</li>
<li>Responding to the Tigray Humanitarian Crisis: Nearly $1.2 million in U.S. humanitarian assistance for UNFPA will increase support for crisis-affected women who have fled the violence and instability in Ethiopia’s Tigray region to seek safe haven in Sudan.</li>
<li>Responding to Humanitarian Needs in Afghanistan: Nearly $1.5 million of the more than $266 million in U.S. humanitarian assistance announced on June 4, 2021 will support UNFPA operations as part of our commitment to international protection in Afghanistan, particularly for Afghan returnees and internally displaced persons.</li>
<li>Responding to Humanitarian Needs in Sudan: Some $1.3 million in humanitarian assistance in Sudan for a strengthened and coordinated multi-sectoral response to gender-based violence to support internally displaced persons and vulnerable populations.</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, DC</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Great.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it, and again, it’s really a pleasure to be with both of you and all the members of this committee, and I really appreciate this opportunity to talk about the administration’s proposed budget and how it will help achieve our national security priorities and deliver results for the American people, which is our common objective.</p>
<p>I do think this is a critical moment for the United States and our global leadership.  As you both alluded to, we face major tests, including stopping COVID-19, rising to the challenge of the climate crisis, supporting a global economic recovery that delivers for American workers and families.</p>
<p>We have to revitalize our alliances and partnerships; out-compete China and defend the international rules-based order against those who seek to undermine it; renew democratic values at home and abroad; and push back against malign activity by our adversaries.</p>
<p>In a more competitive world, other countries are making historic investments in their foreign policy toolkit.  We need to do the same thing.  That’s why, in this budget, we’ve requested 58.5 billion for the State Department and USAID for Fiscal Year 2022.  And Ranking Member Rogers, I just want to point out I’m already saving you some money right there.  I think it’s 58.5 billion, so I’ve been responsive to your concern.</p>
<p>And let me just give you some specifics about how we plan to spend these funds if you support them.</p>
<p>First, the budget will strengthen global health.  The United States has been a leader in this field for decades in Africa, around the world.  We’re asking for $10 billion for global health programs, including nearly $1 billion for global health security, to help us prevent, prepare for, and respond to future global health crises so we can stop outbreaks before they turn into pandemics that put our safety and prosperity in danger.</p>
<p>This budget will accelerate the global response to the climate crisis by providing 2.5 billion for international climate programs, including $1.25 billion to the Green Climate Fund, to help developing countries implement climate adaptation and emissions mitigation programs, which is directly in our interest.</p>
<p>The budget would double down on the fight for democracy, which, as we all know, is under threat in too many places.  The budget request includes $2.8 billion in foreign assistance to advance human rights, fight corruption, stem the tide of democratic backsliding, and strengthen and defend democracies – for example, through technical training for elections and support for independent media and civil society.  It also requests $300 million for the National Endowment for Democracy.</p>
<p>The budget will support a comprehensive strategy to address the root causes of irregular migration from Central America.  It will invest $861 million in the region as a first step toward a four-year commitment of $4 billion to help prevent violence, reduce poverty, curtail endemic corruption, and expand job and educational opportunity.</p>
<p>It will re-establish American humanitarian leadership, with a request of $10 billion in assistance to support refugees, victims of conflict, other displaced people, and to rebuild the refugee admissions program.</p>
<p>It will support our partners in the Middle East by fully funding our commitments to key countries, including Israel and Jordan, and by restoring humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>It includes a budget request of $3.6 billion to pay our assessed contributions in full to international organizations, initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts, including to restore our annual contribution to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>As China and others work hard to bend international organizations to their worldview, we need to ensure that these organizations remain grounded in the values, principles, and rules of the world – road, excuse me – that have made our shared progress possible for so many decades.</p>
<p>Finally, to deliver in all these areas, the budget will reinvest in our most vital asset – our people.  It will provide new resources to recruit, train, and retain a first-rate, diverse global workforce, with nearly 500 additional Foreign and Civil Service positions – the largest increase in State staffing in a decade.</p>
<p>And it will modernize our technology and cyber security; protect our embassies and consulates; and include a direct appropriation of $320 million for consular services worldwide, so we can continue to provide these vital services to Americans and those who seek to travel, study, or do business with the United States.</p>
<p>Our national security depends not only on the strength of our armed forces but also our ability to conduct effective diplomacy and development.  That’s how we solve global challenges, forge cooperation, advance our interests and values, protect our people, and prevent crises overseas from turning into emergencies here at home. And that’s why diplomacy and development are smart investments for American taxpayers.</p>
<p>A top priority for me as Secretary is to restore the traditional role of Congress as a partner in our foreign policy making.  That’s the spirit that I bring to today’s conversation, and I’m very grateful for this opportunity and the chance to answer any questions.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States is deeply concerned by the continued violence in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon.  We continue to call for both the Cameroonian government and separatist armed groups to end the violence and engage in a dialogue without preconditions to peacefully resolve the crisis.  It is important that children can attend school and that humanitarian aid can be delivered.  We urge all relevant stakeholders in Cameroon and in the diaspora to engage constructively and seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis.</p>
<p>We condemn those who undermine peace through engaging in or inciting violence, human rights violations and abuses, and threats against advocates for peace or humanitarian workers.</p>
<p>I am establishing a policy imposing visa restrictions on individuals who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining the peaceful resolution of the crisis in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon. This decision reflects our commitment to advance a dialogue to peacefully resolve the Anglophone crisis and support respect for human rights.  The United States strongly supports the Cameroonian people, and we remain committed to working together to advance democracy and mutual prosperity for both our countries.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Secretary Antony Blinken signed an agreement for the United States to join the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals, and Sustainable Development (IGF).  The IGF is a voluntary partnership that includes more than 75 member nations from six continents.  Its members share a commitment to ensure mining contributes to sustainable development and that negative impacts are limited, and financial benefits shared.</p>
<p>By joining the IGF, the United States strengthens its dedication to mining that seeks poverty reduction, inclusive growth, social development, and environmental stewardship.  The United States will continue to forge a path to improve resource governance and decision making by governments involved in mining, as it has done with the Energy Resource Governance Initiative (ERGI), which was launched in 2019.  IGF and ERGI efforts will dovetail to foster the adoption of responsible mining practices with strong environmental and ecological standards internationally and work to strengthen mineral supply chains through engagement with governments, industry, and civil society.</p>
<p>For further information, contact Donald Kilburg, Spokesperson for the Bureau of Energy Resources, at <a href="mailto:KilburgDF@state.gov">KilburgDF@state.gov</a> or visit <a href="http://www.state.gov/e/enr" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.state.gov/e/enr&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623172661120000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFmf2gQ8GFMm9jWprzSgtGE07iWow">http://www.state.gov/e/enr</a>.  Additional information is also available on Twitter at @EnergyAtState.</p>

<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member McCaul, all committee members, thank you very, very much for this opportunity to talk about our proposed budget and how it will help achieve our national security priorities and deliver results for the American people, which is what I know all of us are about.</p>
<p>This is a critical moment for the United States and our global leadership.</p>
<p>We face major tests – you’ve alluded to some of them already – including stopping COVID-19, rising to the challenge of the climate crisis, supporting a global economic recovery that delivers for our workers and their families.</p>
<p>We got to revitalize our alliances and partnerships, out-compete China, and defend the international rules-based order against those who would seek to undermine it, renew democratic values at home and abroad, and push back against malign activity by our adversaries.</p>
<p>In a more competitive world, other countries are making historic investments in their foreign policy toolkits.  We need to do the same.</p>
