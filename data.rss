					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of State has no greater responsibility than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas.  We are committed to providing U.S. citizens with up-to-date and timely information, so they are informed as they make international travel plans and when they are abroad.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Given the increases in international travel, the availability of effective COVID-19 mitigation measures, and recently announced changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) COVID-19 Travel Health Notice (THN) process, we have reassessed how COVID-19 considerations factor into our Travel Advisory levels for U.S. citizens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Starting next week, the State Department Travel Advisory levels will no longer automatically correlate with the CDC COVID-19 THN level.  However, if the CDC raises a country’s COVID-19 THN to a Level 4, the State Department’s Travel Advisory for that country will also be raised to a Level 4: Do Not Travel due to COVID-19.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This update will leave approximately 10% of all Travel Advisories at Level 4: Do Not Travel.  This 10% includes Level 4 Travel Advisories for all risk indicators, not just COVID-19.  We believe the updated framework will help U.S. citizens make better informed decisions about the safety of international travel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Although conditions have recently improved, the COVID-19 pandemic is not over.  We continue to advise travelers to consider COVID-19 conditions and restrictions at their destinations when considering international travel.  Our embassies and consulates around the world will continue to provide the latest country-specific COVID-19-related information on their<span> </span><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/COVID-19-Country-Specific-Information.html">websites</a>.  To see the latest State Department Travel Advisories for any country in the world, visit<span> </span><a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA0MTQuNTY0MTEyNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RyYXZlbC5zdGF0ZS5nb3YvY29udGVudC90cmF2ZWwvZW4vdHJhdmVsYWR2aXNvcmllcy90cmF2ZWxhZHZpc29yaWVzLmh0bWwvIn0.C7cqloGI8MkiT5P5zJpM4iJ8E3yEosgtEjgDjCBlZ8Q%2Fs%2F402704358%2Fbr%2F129806199590-l&amp;data=04%7C01%7CTranMJ%40state.gov%7C4b26ab571062491264f808da1e1ae649%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637855398126092257%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=MpcHcvOH71wY4nTyIrQvuM7wO4f8ge4wSsntlFx2EOU%3D&amp;reserved=0">travel.state.gov</a>.  We encourage U.S. citizens who are considering international travel this summer to check their passport expiration date and act now to renew or apply for the first time.  Keep in mind many countries require passports to have at least six months’ remaining validity for entry.  Routine passport processing can take eight to eleven weeks.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good morning, everyone.  It is a great pleasure to have my colleague and friend Foreign Minister Hoekstra here.  We’ve been seeing each other at NATO it seems on a now almost regular basis, on the phone, but it’s especially good to have you here in Washington.</p>
<p>And it’s simply evidence of the fact that the partnership between the United States and the Netherlands couldn’t be stronger and also couldn’t be more important.  At a time of tremendous challenge in Europe and around the world, we are standing strongly, resolutely together in support of Ukraine, against Russia’s aggression, in defense of the rules-based order that both of our countries are united in our determination to defend.  We could not be more grateful for this partnership.  It’s a longstanding one, one that we place tremendous value on, and particularly in challenging times it always demonstrates its great value.</p>
<p>So we’re grateful for the leadership that the Netherlands is showing throughout Europe and indeed around the world.  The voice is strong, the voice is important, the voice is valued, and so is the partnership.</p>
<p>We’ve got lots of other things to talk about, but I’m really grateful for the opportunity to actually have you here in Washington and to continue the conversations we’ve been having these many weeks.  So welcome.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER HOEKSTRA:</strong>  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary, Dear Tony. Thank you very much for having us in what is truly an unprecedented era in history.  And it’s also a time where we see more than ever the tremendous importance of the transatlantic bonds.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your leadership, for making sure that you and NATO work seamlessly together, for making sure the excellent bond between our two countries is as strong as ever.  And we will make sure that we continue to work together on all the challenging events – currently Ukraine, but there is much more to do, much more geopolitical challenges that we will face, and we value very much the bilateral bonds but also the excellent relationship between the U.S. and the European Union.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you, all.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><span>Today, the White House released the U.S. Department of State’s Equity Action Plan to implement Executive Order (E.O.) 13985 on <em>Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government</em>.  On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued E.O. 13985 directing the federal government to take comprehensive action in policymaking and operations to address racial equity and barriers to opportunity for underserved communities.  E.O. 13985 also mandated every federal agency develop an Equity Action Plan outlining its implementation efforts. </span><span>Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Brian P. McKeon has led the enterprise-wide implementation of E.O. 13985 for the U.S. Department of State.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The U.S. Department of State’s Equity Action Plan targets five priority areas for embedding equity into foreign affairs work: (1) foreign policy development and implementation, (2) foreign assistance, (3) public diplomacy, (4) consular services, and (5) procurement, contracts, and grants.  The Equity Action Plan outlines specific actions, metrics, and accountability efforts to successfully integrate E.O. 13985 into the U.S. Department of State’s foreign affairs mission.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Inequity is a national security challenge with global consequences. The systematic exclusion of individuals from historically marginalized and vulnerable groups from full participation in economic, social, and civic life impedes equity globally, while fueling corruption, economic migration, distrust, and authoritarianism. That is why the Administration pledged to “defend and protect human rights and address discrimination, inequity, and marginalization in all its forms” in its interim national security strategy. It is also why President Biden on his first day in office directed his Administration to take comprehensive action to address barriers to opportunity for underserved communities with Executive Order (E.O.) 13985 on <em>Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government</em>. This E.O. mandated every federal agency produce an Equity Action Plan outlining its implementation efforts.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Deputy Secretary of State Brian P. McKeon has led the Department’s implementation of the E.O., and today, the White House released our Equity Action Plan to implement the E.O. In the coming months, we will also establish a Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice to continue operationalizing this E.O. across our foreign affairs work.</p>
<p>We know that embedding equity across our foreign affairs work will raise the visibility of racial and other inequities globally and generate better-informed foreign policies to decrease barriers to equity and equality worldwide. This Equity Action Plan identifies ways to successfully integrate the E.O. into our externally-facing efforts, such as diplomatic engagements, high-level dialogues, multilateral efforts, foreign assistance, public diplomacy and exchanges, procurement and contracts, and more.</p>
<p>The Department is committed to the principle of equity across all of our programs and policies, and the plan released today will serve as our blueprint for achieving that goal.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>I extend my congratulations to Jim O’Brien, who began serving this week after his confirmation by the Senate as the Department’s Head of the Office of Sanctions Coordination with the rank of Ambassador.  Ambassador O’Brien brings decades of foreign policy experience to this role, having held senior positions at the Department and in the private sector.</p>
<p>The new Office of Sanctions Coordination will oversee work on sanctions and further strengthen cooperation with allies and partners in the use of this critical tool.  It will also promote accountability for corruption and human rights abuse and deter and disrupt activities that threaten our national security.</p>
<p>This is a critical office at a critical time, and I am confident Ambassador O’Brien and his team will serve the Department and the American people extraordinarily well.</p>
