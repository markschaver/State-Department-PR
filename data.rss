					<description><![CDATA[<p>Acting Assistant Secretary for Near East Asian Affairs Joey Hood, Acting Director of the Office of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS Patrick Worman, And Office of Monetary Affairs Director Susannah Cooper</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Yes, thank you.  Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.  It’s my pleasure to welcome you to this call previewing Secretary Blinken’s trip to Italy for meetings on Syria, the D-ISIS coalition, and the G20.  The trip was announced officially on June 18th.</p>
<p>Before we get started, I would like to give you a quick reminder that this call is on the record, but that the contents are embargoed until the call is completed.  I’ll also add that we will be focusing on answering questions and giving information related to this trip.  As always, a transcript of this call will be posted on <a href="http://state.gov/">state.gov</a>.</p>
<p>And again, as part of that focus, we’re looking at the Syria meeting, the D-ISIS coalition, and the G20, so I’d ask that you limit your questions to those topics.</p>
<p>Now, it’s my pleasure to let you know that we have with us today Acting Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, Joey Hood; Acting Director of the Office of the Special Envoy to Defeat ISIS, Patrick Worman; and the Director of the Office of Monetary Affairs in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, Susannah Cooper.  These are the three who will be briefing you today.  Here at the top, I’m going to ask our briefers to give an overview of these segments of Secretary Blinken’s trip, and then we’ll take some of your questions.</p>
<p>And with that, I’m now going to hand it over to Acting Assistant Secretary Hood to start us off.</p>
<p><strong>MR HOOD:</strong>  Thank you very much, JT.  Good afternoon and good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining us today.</p>
<p>The Secretary and Italian Foreign Minister De Maio will co-host on June 28th a ministerial on Syria to discuss the crisis there.</p>
<p>The meeting will be an opportunity for the Secretary to hear directly from key allies and countries as we continue to discuss the best way forward for a resolution toward that crisis.</p>
<p>And during the meeting, the Secretary will underscore the importance of meeting humanitarian needs throughout the country, including through the provision and expansion of the UN cross-border mechanism.</p>
<p>The United States supports all forms of assistance for the Syrian people – we want to make this clear – including cross-line assistance from Damascus.  But the truth is that cross-line assistance alone cannot meet the current needs in Syria.  Cross-border assistance is critical to avoiding a greater humanitarian catastrophe there.</p>
<p>The Secretary will also make clear our support for an immediate nationwide ceasefire to ensure the safe delivery of aid and to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people.</p>
<p>We intend to retain a limited military presence in the northeast for the sole purpose of defeating ISIS in partnership with the Syrian Democratic Forces and to stabilize areas liberated from that group.</p>
<p>Stability in Syria, and the greater region, can only be achieved through a political process that represents the will of all Syrians.  We’re committed to working with allies, partners, and the UN to ensure that a durable political solution remains within reach.  The international community must renew its shared resolve to ensure the protection, dignity, and human rights of the Syrian people.</p>
<p>There can be no sustainable end to the conflict without progress in this area.</p>
<p>We’re grateful to Italy for co-hosting the ministerial.  Italy’s commitment to Syria has been key for coordinating international efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and access to – for millions of Syrians who desperately need our help.</p>
<p>And now, it’s my pleasure to hand over to Patrick Worman from our Office of the Special Envoy to Defeat ISIS and to the coalition – the ISIS – Defeat ISIS coalition, sorry.</p>
<p>Patrick, over to you.</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  Joey, thanks, and hello, everyone, and thank you for the opportunity to speak today.</p>
<p>Since complete territorial defeat of ISIS in 2019 and the end of major combat operations, our work has continued steadily.  ISIS remains a determined enemy.  There is still much work to do in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS continues to conduct attacks and sow fear among local populations.</p>
<p>We continue to strengthen our efforts to counter ISIS’s global network of branches and affiliates, as well as its twisted ideology and capability to plan terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is committed to carrying forward the important mission to defeat ISIS.  The 83-member Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS remains critically important to our efforts to ensure ISIS’s lasting defeat.</p>
<p>This is why we are so glad that the coalition can meet in person once again.  It will be the first time in-person full coalition ministerial since February of 2019.  During our meeting in Rome, we will discuss key objectives in our continued efforts.  At this meeting, ministers will discuss ways to sustain pressure in Iraq and Syria and counter ISIS networks globally, including in Africa.</p>
<p>The coalition’s mission in Iraq is to support the Government of Iraq’s efforts to secure the enduring defeat of ISIS.</p>
<p>We are committed to working with the Government of Iraq to target remaining ISIS cells, deny ISIS sanctuary, and to eliminate ISIS media, finance, and facilitation networks.  This includes providing support to Iraqi counterterrorism operations and continued support to the Government of Iraq’s development of a professional and capable Iraqi security force.  Our deep political and military partnership with the Government of Iraq has been essential to our recent successes and will be key to any future successes.</p>
<p>In addition to security, we must also address remaining humanitarian stabilization and early recovery gaps to help victims of ISIS atrocities and others impacted by the conflict recover and thus minimize ISIS’s recruitment and resurgence capability.  As part of the civilian effort, ensuring ISIS members are held accountable for their crimes and promoting community-based reconciliation will be critical to countering ISIS messaging and combating ISIS’s depraved ideology.  Accountability efforts must be accompanied by support for survivors of ISIS atrocities to increase their access to legal and psychosocial services needed for their journey to healing, but also to amplify their voices in all discussions on justice and the future of Syria and Iraq.  We will continue to provide targeted assistance to bolster justice and accountability efforts and provide survivors of ISIS crimes with the support they deserve.</p>
<p>While we have succeeded in facilitating the safe and voluntary return of over 4 million Iraqis to their homes, 1.2 million remain displaced.  Some of those will need to be reintegrated into local communities; others will need resolution of complex political and security challenges before they are able to safely return home.</p>
<p>The coalition will continue to press the Government of Iraq to do more in support of recovery, reconciliation, and increased decentralization in liberated areas to address this challenge.</p>
<p>In Syria, working “by, with, and through” the Syrian Democratic Forces, the coalition effectively secured the territorial defeat of ISIS in Syria at an exceptionally low cost and with a very small number of casualties for coalition forces, though we must recognize the toll paid by the SDF, which is over 11,000 killed in action and tens of thousands more wounded.</p>
<p>President Biden has expressed support for maintaining our small number of U.S. forces in northeast Syria to support local partners and prevent an ISIS resurgence.</p>
<p>We are continuing to monitor ISIS activity throughout the country and assess that ISIS has continued its efforts to regroup and carry out attacks, but has been able to do so more effectively in non-SDF-controlled areas, particularly in the Badiya Desert.  We continue to advise and support counterterrorism operations against ISIS remnants in the northeast and conduct strikes on ISIS and al-Qaida targets across Syria.  We also rely on the SDF to ensure the security necessary for the delivery of humanitarian and stabilization assistance in the northeast, which is needed now more than ever to support locals’ needs amid the northeast’s struggling economy, and stabilize liberated areas to allow IDP returns.</p>
<p>Two key areas of concern in the northeast remain the 10,000 captured ISIS fighters in makeshift SDF detention facilities and tens of thousands of women and children in humanitarian camps subject to significant security issues and ISIS efforts to exploit the camps.</p>
<p>On detainees, the coalition is working to ensure that 2,000 foreign terrorist fighters and 2,000 Iraqis in SDF custody are ultimately returned to their countries of origin and face accountability.  U.S. and coalition support to SDF detentions is critical, but this should not be misunderstood to be the long-term solution.  Repatriation, then prosecution or rehabilitation, as appropriate, is the only long-term solution for the non-Syrians.</p>
<p>For better long-term security, we continue to encourage repatriations and support IDP returns via stabilization assistance.  Humanitarian agencies are providing basic psychosocial support to some camp residents with a focus on more than 40,000 children.  But more in-depth psychosocial support, child-focused services, protection, and education activities, especially in the areas that Syrians leaving al-Hol return to, are needed as a foundation for any future disengagement and reintegration efforts.</p>
<p>We are working with our partners to consider how they might support humanitarian agencies providing to these populations.  These issues are exceptionally complex and span counterterrorism, security, and humanitarian imperatives.  We will continue to work diligently with our partners on the breadth of issues raised by this challenging problem.</p>
<p>Despite territorial setbacks in Iraq and Syria, ISIS is actively expanding globally.  We are keeping our focus on the continuing efforts in the core, but simultaneously putting increasing pressure on ISIS’s global networks.  It has worked to make its branches and networks more resilient and continues to exploit areas of local instability and conflict to recruit and train new generations of terrorist fighters.</p>
<p>The coalition is going to discuss new challenges ISIS is posing in Africa, with a focus on West Africa and the Sahel.</p>
<p>Not one of its branches has renounced its allegiance to ISIS, despite its territorial setbacks.  These branches have also served as trans-regional enablers, providing support to organize, raise funds, communicate, recruit, train, produce media, maintain local terrorist activities, and plan operations.</p>
<p>While each branch remains unique, with local and opportunistic motivations, coalition information and intelligence sharing, as well as the exchange of expertise and lessons learned from Iraq and Syria, are maintained and encouraged between coalition partners and through select working groups to address ISIS’s threat at the global level.</p>
<p>The 83 members of our global coalition will continue to draw on all elements of national power – military, intelligence, diplomacy, economic, law enforcement, and the strength of our communities to defeat this brutal terrorist organization, while acknowledging that there is no single approach to the global defeat of ISIS; indeed, most approaches will not mirror the military-centric efforts in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>Well, thank you, again, for the opportunity to speak with you today, and I look forward to answering your questions.</p>
<p>And with that, I’ll now hand it over to Susannah.</p>
<p><strong>MS COOPER:</strong>  Thanks very much, Patrick.  During President Biden’s participation in the G7 summit in Cornwall, the President underscored the U.S. commitment to multilateralism, a theme which Secretary Blinken will reinforce during his June 28-29th trip to the G20 Foreign and Development Ministers’ Meetings in Bari and Matera, Italy.</p>
<p>G20 members account for more than 80 percent of global gross domestic product, three-quarters of global trade, and at least three-quarters of global emissions, and two-thirds of the world’s population, so it is an important forum for international economic policy coordination.</p>
<p>This engagement is an opportunity for the Secretary to encourage greater cooperation in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing the climate crisis, supporting and promoting food security, advancing democracy and human rights, and building back better with global partners, including the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, in support of an inclusive and sustainable economic recovery.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken will travel to Matera on June 29th, where he will participate in several events including the G20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and the Joint Foreign Affairs and Development Ministerial.  This will be the first in-person meeting of G20 foreign ministers since 2019, and we thank Italy, which currently holds the G20 presidency, for its leadership in hosting this event.  The United States fully supports Italy’s focus for its G20 presidency on combating COVID-19, tackling the climate crisis, and fostering a strong, equitable, and sustainable economic recovery.</p>
<p>At the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, Secretary Blinken will stress the importance of multilateralism as our best tool for tackling global challenges while highlighting U.S. leadership in the multilateral response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>To address the climate crisis, Secretary Blinken will encourage G20 members to work together toward ambitious outcomes, including a recognition of the need to keep a 1.5 degree celsius of warming threshold within reach, the importance of actions this decade that are aligned with that goal, and taking other steps like committing to end public finance for overseas unabated coal.</p>
<p>In support of building a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery and building back better worldwide, Secretary Blinken will call upon members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework to join consensus in building a global tax system that is equitable and equipped to meet the needs of the 21st century global economy, including an ambitious global minimum corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>The Secretary will also urge G20 creditor nations to fully and transparently implement the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatments.</p>
<p>During the foreign ministers’ working lunch, Secretary Blinken and his G20 counterparts will discuss supporting inclusive economic development and prosperity in Africa, including addressing ongoing humanitarian and human rights challenges, such as the conflict-induced famine and ongoing abuses and atrocities in Ethiopia, youth engagement, gender equity, and regional integration.</p>
<p>Finally, at the Joint Foreign Affairs and Development Ministerial session, the Secretary will join G20 foreign and development ministers to discuss global food security.  USAID Administrator Ambassador Samantha Power will join Secretary Blinken virtually from Washington to jointly represent the United States at this session.  Ambassador Marcia Bernicat, who is serving as the department senior official for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment and acting assistant secretary for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, will accompany Secretary Blinken to the G20.</p>
<p>I’m happy to take your questions on the G20 aspect of the trip during the Q&amp;A, but for now we’ll give the floor back to JT.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Thank you so much.  Okay, at this point I’m going to ask the operator to give the instructions again on how to get into our question queue, and then we’ll get started.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Of course.  And ladies and gentlemen, once again, if you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your telephone keypad.  You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the 1 then 0 command.  Once again, if you have any questions at this time, please press 1 then 0.  And one moment, please, for our first question.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay.  Let’s go to the line, please, of Arshad Mohammed.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Mr. Mohammed, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  This is a question for Acting Assistant Secretary Hood.  As I’m sure you’re aware, IAEA Director General Grossi today said Iran has not responded to its letter about continuing the technical understandings agreement on monitoring its nuclear program, and he has asked for an immediate response from the Iranians on this.  As you know, that understanding expired yesterday.  Is the U.S. Government going to reconsider its participation in the Vienna talks if Iran does not respond and ultimately extend the monitoring agreement?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR HOOD:</strong>  Well, Arshad, I’m going to refer to JT to get you someone to address that question after the call, because my – I’m prepared to talk about the Syria ministerial here, and I’m also on the road in Europe, and so probably I’m not the best place – person to address that.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Yes.  Thank you, Acting Assistant Secretary Hood.  This is JT.  Yeah, Arshad, we can take that question – we can take that question for you.</p>
<p>Okay, at this point let’s please go to the line of Jared Szuba.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Mr. Szuba, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, thanks for doing this.  I’m just wondering if the Syria policy review is still ongoing, or is the policy, as stated on this call, that which Secretary Blinken will be presenting to allies (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>MR HOOD:</strong>  Thank you for the question, Jared.  The policy that I laid out here is what the Secretary’s going to be talking about.  He’s going to be talking about how we are very much focused right now on meeting the immediate needs of the Syrian people, which includes not just the provision of vital humanitarian assistance, but also maintaining ceasefires around the country and ensuring the defeat of ISIS, because we don’t want to drop the focus on these issues and see more people start dying again.</p>
<p>We also – he’s going to talk about how we’re committed to the political process led by the Syrian people, as envisioned in UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and in holding the regime accountable for the innumerable atrocities it has inflicted on its own people.  So that’s what ministerial attendees are going to hear about from the Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay.  Let’s go to the line of Jessica Donati.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I was wondering – a question about ISIS.  The U.S. is leaving Afghanistan; there are no plans for bases in Pakistan or the general neighborhood.  What is the plan to deal with ISIS emerging in the east?</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  ISIS-Khorasan, or ISIS-K as they’re referred to within the halls of the USG, is something that we’ve remained focused on for some time.  They remain one of the more lethal and active ISIS branches that are in Afghanistan.  And I think that you can be assured that the attention of the administration through our continuing security partnership with the Afghan Government is going to remain focused on making sure that ISIS-K is not able to conduct attacks and threaten populations in Afghanistan.  And that’s what I can provide for now outside of the constructs of the ISIS ministerial itself.  We could get you further information after the briefing.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay, let’s please go to the line of Paolo Mastrolilli.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you very much for the briefing.  During a recent briefing in view of this trip, Ambassador Norland spoke about the activity of ISIS in Libya.  Do you see the risk, the possibility, that Libya could be used by ISIS to do terroristic activity in Europe?</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  Yes, we remain closely focused on all ISIS branch and network activity worldwide.  And suffice to say it is of particular concern – the ISIS branch and network threat across West Africa, to include portions of North Africa, including Libya.  That’s something that we and our partners, particularly our Western European partners, as you note, are particularly focused on.  But yes, that clearly encompasses our continued and growing secure – concern, I’m sorry, with the ISIS branch and network threat across West and Northern Africa.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Let’s now go to the line of Eric Schmitt.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  President Macron recently announced the end of Operation Barkhane in the Sahel will be coming soon, reducing the French military presence in that region.  How will that affect the U.S. military presence in the Sahel, which is now roughly 1,100 troops, which has largely been in support of the French?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  Hi, Eric.  Yes, that’s something we’re definitely paying close attention to and have been in close conversations with our French and as well as our other Western European counterparts about.  But since that is rather, as I think you know, a more encompassing issue than just the ISIS threat and there are other malign terrorist actors across West Africa, I think we prefer to take that one offline, but we can certainly get you an answer after the briefing.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay, let’s go to the line of Elizabeth Hagedorn.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Inaudible) and of course to see the resolution renewed.  But has any consideration been given to scaling up direct U.S. funding to the local Syrian NGOs in the event that they lose their UN funding with a non-renewal?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MR HOOD:</strong>  Well, Elizabeth, I think you’re aware that the reason why we’re relying on the UN for the major part of humanitarian assistance to Syrians is because no one has the scale and scope and logistical backbone of the United Nations system.  So that’s why we’re putting our efforts toward renewing the Security Council resolution and expanding the access points to not just Bab al-Hawa but Bab al-Salam and Yarubiyah as well.  And we think that’s what’s vital and that’s what we need to push for.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Let’s now go to the line of Jonathan Landay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, thanks for doing this.  I’d like to go back to the question of ISIS-K.  Your response was that the United States will continue to work with its counterterrorism partner in Afghanistan on ensuring that you keep the ISIS-K – you can control the ISIS-K threat.  But your partners in Afghanistan, the CT forces that have been trained by the United States in particular, are deeply engaged in combat with the Taliban, who are on a spring offensive.  How do you propose to work with them and keep a efficient eye on ISIS-K when they are at – they are deeply involved in combat?  And I recall the head of the CIA testifying earlier this year that the United States will lose intelligence on threats coming out of Afghanistan when the U.S. – when the U.S. military drawdown is done.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  Yeah, thanks for the question.  I think we’re going to have to take that one offline as well, as it’s almost certainly going to include getting – gathering some information with other bureaus within the department in order to get you a more comprehensive answer.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay, let’s go to the line of Laura Kelly, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Yes, we have you, Laura.  Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Okay, thank you so much for taking my question.  Following President Biden’s meeting with Russian President Putin, is Secretary Blinken optimistic that the border crossing between Turkey and Syria will remain open for humanitarian assistance?</p>
<p>And if I may, another question.  How many U.S. forces are remaining in Syria, and does Turkey’s opposition to Kurdish forces in that area hurt or harm the U.S. presence in the region?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR HOOD:</strong>  Okay, I’m going to try to remember all three of those.  I would defer to DOD on the number of forces in the region, but they are remaining there, as I said, solely focused on the defeat of ISIS.  The relationship between the Turks and our Kurdish partners and Arab partners in the northeast is something that we’re obviously very concerned about, and we want to make sure that Turkey understands our intentions with regards to northeast Syria and exactly what our focus is.  And we want to continue to focus on not just the defeat of ISIS but also the remaining of the humanitarian access points across the borders.</p>
<p>I think you asked at first whether we were confident that we would be able to maintain the border crossing at Bab al Hawa, and the answer is yes.  I think that we see here an opportunity to work constructively with Russia on this issue of getting humanitarian assistance to Syrians all across the country, especially now that we have the COVID pandemic to deal with and there has been virtually no assistance to battle COVID that’s gotten into the northeast in particular.  So it’s a growing humanitarian problem and one that I don’t think anyone wants to see exacerbated.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  I think we have time for just a couple more questions.  Let’s please go to the line of Joseph Haboush.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Mr. Haboush, your line is open.  Please, go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  I wanted to ask if there is any comment on what’s perceived to be changing climate in the Middle East for traditional U.S. allies to re-establish diplomatic ties with the Assad regime.  And also, is there a concern that these pockets of ISIS could re-emerge in neighboring Lebanon with the ongoing crises there?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR HOOD:</strong>  Hi, Joseph.  Sorry, it’s taking me a couple of minutes to deal with the buttons on my phone, so sorry for the pause.</p>
<p>But with regard to normalization, we are – do not intend to normalize the Assad regime absent a major change in behavior on its part.  And with regard to others who may be considering making moves, we are asking them to consider very carefully the atrocities committed by the regime on the Syrian people over the last decade as well as the regime’s continuing efforts to deny much of the country access to humanitarian aid and security.</p>
<p>And I would also, of course, add that we also have the Caesar Act sanctions.  This is a law that has wide bipartisan support in the Congress, and the administration is going to follow the law on that.  And so governments and businesses need to be careful that their proposed or envisioned transactions don’t expose them to potential sanctions from the United States under that act.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay, and I think we have time for one more question.  Let’s please go to the line of Mitch Tanaka.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, thank you for taking my question.  My question is on G20.  Are there any plans to have any bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the meeting, especially with the Russian or Chinese and Japanese counterparts?</p>
<p><strong>MS COOPER:</strong>  Thank you.  I don’t have any additional meetings to announce at this time.  Obviously, we can refer you back to JT and the spokesperson about this.  I can say there is no meeting planned between Secretary Blinken and the Chinese foreign minister at the G20 Ministerial.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay.  And I think with that quick one, we can take just one more.  Let’s go to the line of Noor Zahra.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello, thank you very much for your time.  I was just wondering with the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, did that help in decreasing Iran’s influence in the region, or does it actually help with increasing the presence of ISIS?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Patrick, can you take that question?</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  Yeah, could you just repeat the end of that really quickly?  I think I lost that.  My apologies.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes.  Was the assassination of Qasem Soleimani – I was wondering does that help in decreasing the presence of the interference of the Iranian influence in the neighboring countries like Bahrain and Iraq, or did it help increase the number of ISIS fighters?</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  I’m not sure we see really necessarily any clear connection per se.  ISIS branches and affiliates both within the region and beyond continue to pose a somewhat persistent threat.  But we feel quite good both within the coalition and within – with our – with the international system more broadly on the sort of scheme and effort that we have set out, which is highlighted by close intelligence and information sharing, border security efforts, rule of law, and efforts to counter ISIS’s malign narratives.  So I think those efforts continue apace, and I think they continue successfully quite independent of any implications emanating from the assassination of Soleimani.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay.  And with that that’s all the time we have today.  I do want to take a moment to thank our briefers, Acting Assistant Secretary Joey Hood, Acting Director Patrick Worman, and Director Susanna Cooper, for being with us today.  And I’d like to thank everyone who dialed in for their participation.  With that, the call is ended, and the embargo is lifted.  Everyone have a nice weekend.</p>

<p>The Secretary and Italian Foreign Minister De Maio will co-host on June 28th a ministerial on Syria to discuss the crisis there.</p>
<p>The meeting will be an opportunity for the Secretary to hear directly from key allies and countries as we continue to discuss the best way forward for a resolution toward that crisis.</p>
<p>And during the meeting, the Secretary will underscore the importance of meeting humanitarian needs throughout the country, including through the provision and expansion of the UN cross-border mechanism.</p>
<p>The United States supports all forms of assistance for the Syrian people – we want to make this clear – including cross-line assistance from Damascus.  But the truth is that cross-line assistance alone cannot meet the current needs in Syria.  Cross-border assistance is critical to avoiding a greater humanitarian catastrophe there.</p>
<p>The Secretary will also make clear our support for an immediate nationwide ceasefire to ensure the safe delivery of aid and to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people.</p>
<p>We intend to retain a limited military presence in the northeast for the sole purpose of defeating ISIS in partnership with the Syrian Democratic Forces and to stabilize areas liberated from that group.</p>
<p>Stability in Syria, and the greater region, can only be achieved through a political process that represents the will of all Syrians.  We’re committed to working with allies, partners, and the UN to ensure that a durable political solution remains within reach.  The international community must renew its shared resolve to ensure the protection, dignity, and human rights of the Syrian people.</p>
<p>There can be no sustainable end to the conflict without progress in this area.</p>
<p>We’re grateful to Italy for co-hosting the ministerial.  Italy’s commitment to Syria has been key for coordinating international efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and access to – for millions of Syrians who desperately need our help.</p>
<p>And now, it’s my pleasure to hand over to Patrick Worman from our Office of the Special Envoy to Defeat ISIS and to the coalition – the ISIS – Defeat ISIS coalition, sorry.</p>
<p>Patrick, over to you.</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  Joey, thanks, and hello, everyone, and thank you for the opportunity to speak today.</p>
<p>Since complete territorial defeat of ISIS in 2019 and the end of major combat operations, our work has continued steadily.  ISIS remains a determined enemy.  There is still much work to do in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS continues to conduct attacks and sow fear among local populations.</p>
<p>We continue to strengthen our efforts to counter ISIS’s global network of branches and affiliates, as well as its twisted ideology and capability to plan terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is committed to carrying forward the important mission to defeat ISIS.  The 83-member Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS remains critically important to our efforts to ensure ISIS’s lasting defeat.</p>
<p>This is why we are so glad that the coalition can meet in person once again.  It will be the first time in-person full coalition ministerial since February of 2019.  During our meeting in Rome, we will discuss key objectives in our continued efforts.  At this meeting, ministers will discuss ways to sustain pressure in Iraq and Syria and counter ISIS networks globally, including in Africa.</p>
<p>The coalition’s mission in Iraq is to support the Government of Iraq’s efforts to secure the enduring defeat of ISIS.</p>
<p>We are committed to working with the Government of Iraq to target remaining ISIS cells, deny ISIS sanctuary, and to eliminate ISIS media, finance, and facilitation networks.  This includes providing support to Iraqi counterterrorism operations and continued support to the Government of Iraq’s development of a professional and capable Iraqi security force.  Our deep political and military partnership with the Government of Iraq has been essential to our recent successes and will be key to any future successes.</p>
<p>In addition to security, we must also address remaining humanitarian stabilization and early recovery gaps to help victims of ISIS atrocities and others impacted by the conflict recover and thus minimize ISIS’s recruitment and resurgence capability.  As part of the civilian effort, ensuring ISIS members are held accountable for their crimes and promoting community-based reconciliation will be critical to countering ISIS messaging and combating ISIS’s depraved ideology.  Accountability efforts must be accompanied by support for survivors of ISIS atrocities to increase their access to legal and psychosocial services needed for their journey to healing, but also to amplify their voices in all discussions on justice and the future of Syria and Iraq.  We will continue to provide targeted assistance to bolster justice and accountability efforts and provide survivors of ISIS crimes with the support they deserve.</p>
<p>While we have succeeded in facilitating the safe and voluntary return of over 4 million Iraqis to their homes, 1.2 million remain displaced.  Some of those will need to be reintegrated into local communities; others will need resolution of complex political and security challenges before they are able to safely return home.</p>
<p>The coalition will continue to press the Government of Iraq to do more in support of recovery, reconciliation, and increased decentralization in liberated areas to address this challenge.</p>
<p>In Syria, working “by, with, and through” the Syrian Democratic Forces, the coalition effectively secured the territorial defeat of ISIS in Syria at an exceptionally low cost and with a very small number of casualties for coalition forces, though we must recognize the toll paid by the SDF, which is over 11,000 killed in action and tens of thousands more wounded.</p>
<p>President Biden has expressed support for maintaining our small number of U.S. forces in northeast Syria to support local partners and prevent an ISIS resurgence.</p>
<p>We are continuing to monitor ISIS activity throughout the country and assess that ISIS has continued its efforts to regroup and carry out attacks, but has been able to do so more effectively in non-SDF-controlled areas, particularly in the Badiya Desert.  We continue to advise and support counterterrorism operations against ISIS remnants in the northeast and conduct strikes on ISIS and al-Qaida targets across Syria.  We also rely on the SDF to ensure the security necessary for the delivery of humanitarian and stabilization assistance in the northeast, which is needed now more than ever to support locals’ needs amid the northeast’s struggling economy, and stabilize liberated areas to allow IDP returns.</p>
<p>Two key areas of concern in the northeast remain the 10,000 captured ISIS fighters in makeshift SDF detention facilities and tens of thousands of women and children in humanitarian camps subject to significant security issues and ISIS efforts to exploit the camps.</p>
<p>On detainees, the coalition is working to ensure that 2,000 foreign terrorist fighters and 2,000 Iraqis in SDF custody are ultimately returned to their countries of origin and face accountability.  U.S. and coalition support to SDF detentions is critical, but this should not be misunderstood to be the long-term solution.  Repatriation, then prosecution or rehabilitation, as appropriate, is the only long-term solution for the non-Syrians.</p>
<p>For better long-term security, we continue to encourage repatriations and support IDP returns via stabilization assistance.  Humanitarian agencies are providing basic psychosocial support to some camp residents with a focus on more than 40,000 children.  But more in-depth psychosocial support, child-focused services, protection, and education activities, especially in the areas that Syrians leaving al-Hol return to, are needed as a foundation for any future disengagement and reintegration efforts.</p>
<p>We are working with our partners to consider how they might support humanitarian agencies providing to these populations.  These issues are exceptionally complex and span counterterrorism, security, and humanitarian imperatives.  We will continue to work diligently with our partners on the breadth of issues raised by this challenging problem.</p>
<p>Despite territorial setbacks in Iraq and Syria, ISIS is actively expanding globally.  We are keeping our focus on the continuing efforts in the core, but simultaneously putting increasing pressure on ISIS’s global networks.  It has worked to make its branches and networks more resilient and continues to exploit areas of local instability and conflict to recruit and train new generations of terrorist fighters.</p>
<p>The coalition is going to discuss new challenges ISIS is posing in Africa, with a focus on West Africa and the Sahel.</p>
<p>Not one of its branches has renounced its allegiance to ISIS, despite its territorial setbacks.  These branches have also served as trans-regional enablers, providing support to organize, raise funds, communicate, recruit, train, produce media, maintain local terrorist activities, and plan operations.</p>
<p>While each branch remains unique, with local and opportunistic motivations, coalition information and intelligence sharing, as well as the exchange of expertise and lessons learned from Iraq and Syria, are maintained and encouraged between coalition partners and through select working groups to address ISIS’s threat at the global level.</p>
<p>The 83 members of our global coalition will continue to draw on all elements of national power – military, intelligence, diplomacy, economic, law enforcement, and the strength of our communities to defeat this brutal terrorist organization, while acknowledging that there is no single approach to the global defeat of ISIS; indeed, most approaches will not mirror the military-centric efforts in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>Well, thank you, again, for the opportunity to speak with you today, and I look forward to answering your questions.</p>
<p>And with that, I’ll now hand it over to Susannah.</p>
<p><strong>MS COOPER:</strong>  Thanks very much, Patrick.  During President Biden’s participation in the G7 summit in Cornwall, the President underscored the U.S. commitment to multilateralism, a theme which Secretary Blinken will reinforce during his June 28-29th trip to the G20 Foreign and Development Ministers’ Meetings in Bari and Matera, Italy.</p>
<p>G20 members account for more than 80 percent of global gross domestic product, three-quarters of global trade, and at least three-quarters of global emissions, and two-thirds of the world’s population, so it is an important forum for international economic policy coordination.</p>
<p>This engagement is an opportunity for the Secretary to encourage greater cooperation in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing the climate crisis, supporting and promoting food security, advancing democracy and human rights, and building back better with global partners, including the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, in support of an inclusive and sustainable economic recovery.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken will travel to Matera on June 29th, where he will participate in several events including the G20 Foreign Ministers’ Meeting and the Joint Foreign Affairs and Development Ministerial.  This will be the first in-person meeting of G20 foreign ministers since 2019, and we thank Italy, which currently holds the G20 presidency, for its leadership in hosting this event.  The United States fully supports Italy’s focus for its G20 presidency on combating COVID-19, tackling the climate crisis, and fostering a strong, equitable, and sustainable economic recovery.</p>
<p>At the Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, Secretary Blinken will stress the importance of multilateralism as our best tool for tackling global challenges while highlighting U.S. leadership in the multilateral response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>To address the climate crisis, Secretary Blinken will encourage G20 members to work together toward ambitious outcomes, including a recognition of the need to keep a 1.5 degree celsius of warming threshold within reach, the importance of actions this decade that are aligned with that goal, and taking other steps like committing to end public finance for overseas unabated coal.</p>
<p>In support of building a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery and building back better worldwide, Secretary Blinken will call upon members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework to join consensus in building a global tax system that is equitable and equipped to meet the needs of the 21st century global economy, including an ambitious global minimum corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>The Secretary will also urge G20 creditor nations to fully and transparently implement the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatments.</p>
<p>During the foreign ministers’ working lunch, Secretary Blinken and his G20 counterparts will discuss supporting inclusive economic development and prosperity in Africa, including addressing ongoing humanitarian and human rights challenges, such as the conflict-induced famine and ongoing abuses and atrocities in Ethiopia, youth engagement, gender equity, and regional integration.</p>
<p>Finally, at the Joint Foreign Affairs and Development Ministerial session, the Secretary will join G20 foreign and development ministers to discuss global food security.  USAID Administrator Ambassador Samantha Power will join Secretary Blinken virtually from Washington to jointly represent the United States at this session.  Ambassador Marcia Bernicat, who is serving as the department senior official for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment and acting assistant secretary for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, will accompany Secretary Blinken to the G20.</p>
<p>I’m happy to take your questions on the G20 aspect of the trip during the Q&amp;A, but for now we’ll give the floor back to JT.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Thank you so much.  Okay, at this point I’m going to ask the operator to give the instructions again on how to get into our question queue, and then we’ll get started.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Of course.  And ladies and gentlemen, once again, if you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your telephone keypad.  You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the 1 then 0 command.  Once again, if you have any questions at this time, please press 1 then 0.  And one moment, please, for our first question.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay.  Let’s go to the line, please, of Arshad Mohammed.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Mr. Mohammed, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  This is a question for Acting Assistant Secretary Hood.  As I’m sure you’re aware, IAEA Director General Grossi today said Iran has not responded to its letter about continuing the technical understandings agreement on monitoring its nuclear program, and he has asked for an immediate response from the Iranians on this.  As you know, that understanding expired yesterday.  Is the U.S. Government going to reconsider its participation in the Vienna talks if Iran does not respond and ultimately extend the monitoring agreement?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR HOOD:</strong>  Well, Arshad, I’m going to refer to JT to get you someone to address that question after the call, because my – I’m prepared to talk about the Syria ministerial here, and I’m also on the road in Europe, and so probably I’m not the best place – person to address that.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Yes.  Thank you, Acting Assistant Secretary Hood.  This is JT.  Yeah, Arshad, we can take that question – we can take that question for you.</p>
<p>Okay, at this point let’s please go to the line of Jared Szuba.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Mr. Szuba, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, thanks for doing this.  I’m just wondering if the Syria policy review is still ongoing, or is the policy, as stated on this call, that which Secretary Blinken will be presenting to allies (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>MR HOOD:</strong>  Thank you for the question, Jared.  The policy that I laid out here is what the Secretary’s going to be talking about.  He’s going to be talking about how we are very much focused right now on meeting the immediate needs of the Syrian people, which includes not just the provision of vital humanitarian assistance, but also maintaining ceasefires around the country and ensuring the defeat of ISIS, because we don’t want to drop the focus on these issues and see more people start dying again.</p>
<p>We also – he’s going to talk about how we’re committed to the political process led by the Syrian people, as envisioned in UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and in holding the regime accountable for the innumerable atrocities it has inflicted on its own people.  So that’s what ministerial attendees are going to hear about from the Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay.  Let’s go to the line of Jessica Donati.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I was wondering – a question about ISIS.  The U.S. is leaving Afghanistan; there are no plans for bases in Pakistan or the general neighborhood.  What is the plan to deal with ISIS emerging in the east?</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  ISIS-Khorasan, or ISIS-K as they’re referred to within the halls of the USG, is something that we’ve remained focused on for some time.  They remain one of the more lethal and active ISIS branches that are in Afghanistan.  And I think that you can be assured that the attention of the administration through our continuing security partnership with the Afghan Government is going to remain focused on making sure that ISIS-K is not able to conduct attacks and threaten populations in Afghanistan.  And that’s what I can provide for now outside of the constructs of the ISIS ministerial itself.  We could get you further information after the briefing.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay, let’s please go to the line of Paolo Mastrolilli.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you very much for the briefing.  During a recent briefing in view of this trip, Ambassador Norland spoke about the activity of ISIS in Libya.  Do you see the risk, the possibility, that Libya could be used by ISIS to do terroristic activity in Europe?</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  Yes, we remain closely focused on all ISIS branch and network activity worldwide.  And suffice to say it is of particular concern – the ISIS branch and network threat across West Africa, to include portions of North Africa, including Libya.  That’s something that we and our partners, particularly our Western European partners, as you note, are particularly focused on.  But yes, that clearly encompasses our continued and growing secure – concern, I’m sorry, with the ISIS branch and network threat across West and Northern Africa.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Let’s now go to the line of Eric Schmitt.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  President Macron recently announced the end of Operation Barkhane in the Sahel will be coming soon, reducing the French military presence in that region.  How will that affect the U.S. military presence in the Sahel, which is now roughly 1,100 troops, which has largely been in support of the French?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  Hi, Eric.  Yes, that’s something we’re definitely paying close attention to and have been in close conversations with our French and as well as our other Western European counterparts about.  But since that is rather, as I think you know, a more encompassing issue than just the ISIS threat and there are other malign terrorist actors across West Africa, I think we prefer to take that one offline, but we can certainly get you an answer after the briefing.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay, let’s go to the line of Elizabeth Hagedorn.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Inaudible) and of course to see the resolution renewed.  But has any consideration been given to scaling up direct U.S. funding to the local Syrian NGOs in the event that they lose their UN funding with a non-renewal?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MR HOOD:</strong>  Well, Elizabeth, I think you’re aware that the reason why we’re relying on the UN for the major part of humanitarian assistance to Syrians is because no one has the scale and scope and logistical backbone of the United Nations system.  So that’s why we’re putting our efforts toward renewing the Security Council resolution and expanding the access points to not just Bab al-Hawa but Bab al-Salam and Yarubiyah as well.  And we think that’s what’s vital and that’s what we need to push for.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Let’s now go to the line of Jonathan Landay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, thanks for doing this.  I’d like to go back to the question of ISIS-K.  Your response was that the United States will continue to work with its counterterrorism partner in Afghanistan on ensuring that you keep the ISIS-K – you can control the ISIS-K threat.  But your partners in Afghanistan, the CT forces that have been trained by the United States in particular, are deeply engaged in combat with the Taliban, who are on a spring offensive.  How do you propose to work with them and keep a efficient eye on ISIS-K when they are at – they are deeply involved in combat?  And I recall the head of the CIA testifying earlier this year that the United States will lose intelligence on threats coming out of Afghanistan when the U.S. – when the U.S. military drawdown is done.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  Yeah, thanks for the question.  I think we’re going to have to take that one offline as well, as it’s almost certainly going to include getting – gathering some information with other bureaus within the department in order to get you a more comprehensive answer.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay, let’s go to the line of Laura Kelly, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Yes, we have you, Laura.  Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Okay, thank you so much for taking my question.  Following President Biden’s meeting with Russian President Putin, is Secretary Blinken optimistic that the border crossing between Turkey and Syria will remain open for humanitarian assistance?</p>
<p>And if I may, another question.  How many U.S. forces are remaining in Syria, and does Turkey’s opposition to Kurdish forces in that area hurt or harm the U.S. presence in the region?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR HOOD:</strong>  Okay, I’m going to try to remember all three of those.  I would defer to DOD on the number of forces in the region, but they are remaining there, as I said, solely focused on the defeat of ISIS.  The relationship between the Turks and our Kurdish partners and Arab partners in the northeast is something that we’re obviously very concerned about, and we want to make sure that Turkey understands our intentions with regards to northeast Syria and exactly what our focus is.  And we want to continue to focus on not just the defeat of ISIS but also the remaining of the humanitarian access points across the borders.</p>
<p>I think you asked at first whether we were confident that we would be able to maintain the border crossing at Bab al Hawa, and the answer is yes.  I think that we see here an opportunity to work constructively with Russia on this issue of getting humanitarian assistance to Syrians all across the country, especially now that we have the COVID pandemic to deal with and there has been virtually no assistance to battle COVID that’s gotten into the northeast in particular.  So it’s a growing humanitarian problem and one that I don’t think anyone wants to see exacerbated.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  I think we have time for just a couple more questions.  Let’s please go to the line of Joseph Haboush.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Mr. Haboush, your line is open.  Please, go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  I wanted to ask if there is any comment on what’s perceived to be changing climate in the Middle East for traditional U.S. allies to re-establish diplomatic ties with the Assad regime.  And also, is there a concern that these pockets of ISIS could re-emerge in neighboring Lebanon with the ongoing crises there?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR HOOD:</strong>  Hi, Joseph.  Sorry, it’s taking me a couple of minutes to deal with the buttons on my phone, so sorry for the pause.</p>
<p>But with regard to normalization, we are – do not intend to normalize the Assad regime absent a major change in behavior on its part.  And with regard to others who may be considering making moves, we are asking them to consider very carefully the atrocities committed by the regime on the Syrian people over the last decade as well as the regime’s continuing efforts to deny much of the country access to humanitarian aid and security.</p>
<p>And I would also, of course, add that we also have the Caesar Act sanctions.  This is a law that has wide bipartisan support in the Congress, and the administration is going to follow the law on that.  And so governments and businesses need to be careful that their proposed or envisioned transactions don’t expose them to potential sanctions from the United States under that act.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay, and I think we have time for one more question.  Let’s please go to the line of Mitch Tanaka.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, thank you for taking my question.  My question is on G20.  Are there any plans to have any bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the meeting, especially with the Russian or Chinese and Japanese counterparts?</p>
<p><strong>MS COOPER:</strong>  Thank you.  I don’t have any additional meetings to announce at this time.  Obviously, we can refer you back to JT and the spokesperson about this.  I can say there is no meeting planned between Secretary Blinken and the Chinese foreign minister at the G20 Ministerial.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay.  And I think with that quick one, we can take just one more.  Let’s go to the line of Noor Zahra.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello, thank you very much for your time.  I was just wondering with the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, did that help in decreasing Iran’s influence in the region, or does it actually help with increasing the presence of ISIS?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Patrick, can you take that question?</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  Yeah, could you just repeat the end of that really quickly?  I think I lost that.  My apologies.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yes.  Was the assassination of Qasem Soleimani – I was wondering does that help in decreasing the presence of the interference of the Iranian influence in the neighboring countries like Bahrain and Iraq, or did it help increase the number of ISIS fighters?</p>
<p><strong>MR WORMAN:</strong>  I’m not sure we see really necessarily any clear connection per se.  ISIS branches and affiliates both within the region and beyond continue to pose a somewhat persistent threat.  But we feel quite good both within the coalition and within – with our – with the international system more broadly on the sort of scheme and effort that we have set out, which is highlighted by close intelligence and information sharing, border security efforts, rule of law, and efforts to counter ISIS’s malign narratives.  So I think those efforts continue apace, and I think they continue successfully quite independent of any implications emanating from the assassination of Soleimani.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR ICE:</strong>  Okay.  And with that that’s all the time we have today.  I do want to take a moment to thank our briefers, Acting Assistant Secretary Joey Hood, Acting Director Patrick Worman, and Director Susanna Cooper, for being with us today.  And I’d like to thank everyone who dialed in for their participation.  With that, the call is ended, and the embargo is lifted.  Everyone have a nice weekend.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><em>The following statement was released by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, and Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Marc Garneau.</em></p>
<p><em>Begin text:</em></p>
<p>We remain deeply concerned about the ongoing crisis in Venezuela and its regional and global impact.</p>
<p>The peaceful solution to that deep political, social, and economic crisis has to come from the Venezuelan people themselves through Venezuelan-led, comprehensive negotiations with participation from all stakeholders. A time-bound and comprehensive negotiation process should restore the country’s institutions and allow for all Venezuelans to express themselves politically through credible, inclusive and transparent local, parliamentary, and presidential elections.</p>
<p>We call for the unconditional release of all those unjustly detained for political reasons, the independence of political parties, freedom of expression including for members of the press, and an end to human rights abuses.</p>
<p>We welcome substantive, credible advancements to restore core democratic processes and institutions in Venezuela and are willing to review sanctions policies based on meaningful progress in a comprehensive negotiation.</p>
<p>We call for electoral conditions that abide by international standards for democracy, beginning with the local and regional elections scheduled for November 2021.</p>
<p>We remain committed to addressing the dire humanitarian crisis inside Venezuela and welcome further agreement among all political actors in Venezuela to allow for unfettered access to humanitarian assistance, to include food, medicine, and critical COVID-19 relief supplies.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Paris, France</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador’s Residence</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you, thank you.  Thank you all very much.  A lot of familiar faces – I feel like I was just in a photograph with some of you.  It is particularly wonderful to be in this modest house, to be back here and be with all of you.  And I really wanted to have an opportunity to simply say thank you for the great and remarkable work you’ve been doing under incredibly challenging conditions, and I’ll come back to that in a minute.</p>
<p>But let me just start first by thanking Brian for your terrific leadership of this mission over these months.  I’m really grateful for that.  We’ve had an opportunity to spend some time together and get caught up, which I very much appreciate.  And also to Whitney Baird, who is leading our efforts at the OECD, where we had a very good start to the day as well.  So thank you both for your leadership at this particularly important time.</p>
<p>Now, I want to point out a couple of people because one of the things that I like to do every time I have a chance to visit with our missions abroad is spend a moment saying thank you to a particular group.  And that’s our locally employed staff; every single place I go really, as I keep saying, the lifeblood of our missions and the connectivity in so many ways between the missions and the people of the country in which the mission is serving.  There is, I hope with us today either here in person or virtually, the LES of the Year in France, Pedrick Jean Marie Desiree.  Here, right there.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>Working in the Defense Attache office, you’ve facilitated hundreds of DOD movements, ground clearance, as I understand it, for 600 soldiers, 2,000 shipping containers, 110 helicopters.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for your remarkable work and for your partnership with this mission.  We’re grateful to you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>We also have some colleagues who’ve been working with the mission for just a little while who have decided nonetheless to retire.  Corinne Foltier-Thonnel Financial Management Center, served the U.S. Government for 40 plus years.  Thank you so much.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>Jessica Webster, where are you?  Jessica, Minister Counselor for Economic Affairs, for more than 30 years of service.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>And Kate Snipes, where are you?  Kate, Agriculture Counselor, more than 20 years of service.  You’ve each in your individual ways been remarkable public servants, and just on behalf of the State Department, on behalf of the country, I want to express my thanks, my appreciation for everything you’ve done.  We’re grateful for it.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>So you’ve all been dealing, as we all have, with that small problem called COVID-19.  And in all seriousness, I know, especially hearing from so many of your colleagues around the world, hearing already from some of you today, the impact that’s had.  And I know it’s had an impact, a profound impact, on a personal level.  Some of you have lost friends or loved ones.  Many of you know people who got sick.  It’s had an impact on a professional level, because we know how challenging it’s made work, made the mission.</p>
<p>But you have persevered with remarkable resilience, with creativity, with determination, and you’ve kept the mission going, and you’ve kept doing what you’re here to do, which is serve the interests of the American people and serve the relationship between the United States and France.</p>
<p>I really want to thank the Health Unit for the work that you’ve done running vaccine clinics.  I’m so proud of the folks in our Health Units from embassy to embassy around the world and the remarkable job that they have done.</p>
<p>The Information Systems people who have helped people telework, find ways to do their jobs, even while they’ve stayed home.  And Community Liaison, who did virtual programming from wine tastings – okay? – to Toddler Story Hour, to Zumba.  That is a pretty good way of keeping morale going and keeping the mission going.</p>
<p>But I also want to say that one of the things that’s been so important in keeping the mission going – and Brian, thank you again for your leadership on this – is that we’re moving forward in a very demonstrable way on policy, too.  And the Political team, working closely here with our French counterparts in fashioning an even stronger joint approach to the challenges posed by Russia and China – tremendous work done there.  I’ve seen some of the work that the Regional Security Office has done, particularly finding new solutions to deal with visa fraud.  The DAO joint military exercises with U.S., French, UK fighter jets, and then work that was done on data security, fighting disinformation.  It’s just a short way of pointing to a couple of examples where the work of this mission not only has gone on but has been producing real results.</p>
<p>Let me say too, Whitney, for the OECD we’ve had just – the first leadership change there in 15 years, and it was a – both a pleasure and important to connect with the new leader and – Mathias Cormann.  We chair the Ministerial Council of the OECD for the 60th anniversary year.  We’ve got a very important, significant agenda.  We started – or I should say continued work on that today, and if all goes well, I look forward to being back here in the fall to do that.  By the way, it’s the first time in a decide that we’ve been in the position of chairing the council.  So a great start, and I think we’ll continue that in October.</p>
<p>But mostly I just want to emphasize one last thing to all of you, and it’s something I’ve been saying pretty much everywhere.  And our friends who follow us around are probably sick of hearing me say it, but I keep repeating it because it really goes to the heart of what the President is all about and what we’re trying to do.  And that is simply the premium that we all have to place on finding ways, including new ways, to cooperate closely with our partners, starting with France.  As I’ve said – again, repeatedly – if you think about it, not a single one of the challenges that we have to deal with, the things that are actually having an impact on the lives of our fellow citizens back home, whether it’s climate change, whether it’s the pandemic, whether it’s the impact of disruptive technologies, not a single one can be dealt with effectively by any one country acting alone, including the United States, for all the power and resources that we have.</p>
<p>And so there really is a greater need than at least I think ever in my own experience to find ways to work with others.  And that’s exactly what you’re doing.  That is precisely the mission that you’re carrying out every single day.  And so I wanted to share that with you just to underscore the point the work that you’re doing matters.  It’s vitally important.  It really is the difference between whether we’re going to fail or whether we’re going to succeed in meeting the challenges of our time and actually making a difference in the lives of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p>So on behalf of the President, on behalf of everyone back home in Washington, thank you, thank you, thank you for what you’re doing every single day.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Paris, France</p>
<p>Chief of Mission Residence</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Hello, everyone. We are live on – with Antony Blinken, the new Secretary of State of the Biden administration. Hello, Mr. Secretary of State. You are the voice of America in the world. You are actually on an official visit in Europe. You met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and you are going to meet French President Macron in a moment.</p>
<p>We are going to talk about several topics – the threats against democracy, police violence, climate, and racism. And to talk about this, we have 34 young people we invited to have a discussion with you. So you will answer their questions. But I’m talking to you, watching live. You can ask your questions in the comments section and we will try to relay a few of those. My phone is here and I’m reading the comments.</p>
<p>But first of all, Mr. Secretary of State, we will be able to have this discussion in French because you lived in France for a few years, correct?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) Indeed, I moved to France when I was nine. I used to live in New York. I lived here for nine years. I graduated high school here in Paris. I came back to Paris a couple years later to work. And I have friendships that started in school that are lasting, that have lasted over 50 years.</p>
<p>I’m delighted to be here to talk with all of you here today and those who are on the network. There’s an important reason why I wanted to have a dialogue such as this one. I believe that we’re faced with a challenge and also an opportunity. We’ll have to strengthen the links between our countries, and this will be done through you, whether it is through direct contact or on social media. You will be the ones who will build this partnership for the new generation. In my opinion, this is more important than ever. Our history is long-lasting, but it is particularly important today.</p>
<p>I think back to the challenges that we’re facing today, issues that affect all of our lives: the pandemic, COVID, the climate challenge, the impact of technology, new technology just as we’re seeing today. This impact can be good but not always – just like any topic that has an impact on your lives. And what we can see is that whether it is in France or in the U.S., a country that acts alone does not have the ability to face challenges on its own. And that goes for opportunities as well. We cannot build a wall high enough, we cannot build a solid wall to stop this from happening.</p>
<p>More than ever, I think that today there is a need for us to find a way to cooperate between countries so that we can work and act together. This ability is made possible by the ties that link our countries through our mutual values. And those relationships are living. The relationships are made by artistic pursuits, and by trade, and by working individuals. So for me, this is also an opportunity to listen to you, and to see what is important to you, and how you’re seeing the future of our relationships and of our ability to work together.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) We are getting many questions in the comments. It’s true that you are lucky enough to be with us today, but us French still cannot go to the U.S. So one question: When will the borders reopen?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) I cannot give a date but I hope it will be soon. As we do in democracies, we have set up a working group with the EU in order to come back again to this freedom of travel. But we must be guided by science, by the experts in the medical field. We shouldn’t take political decisions, but decisions based on facts and data. I hope this will be very soon. We really want this. I hope it will be in the coming weeks, not months.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Yes, what would be the timeline? Can we imagine going to the U.S. during this summer for holidays?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) I hope so. I cannot provide a date. But we must be careful. We are seeing that we think we’re – we have security, but then there is a new variant of the virus spreading. We see this in certain European countries. We have that same variant, the Delta variant in the U.S. So we really have that desire to reopen quickly, but this needs to be based on facts and science.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Maybe there will be criteria for vaccinated people?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) The experts are looking into it. I think there are different possibilities. I don’t want to talk too much about this. This is not my area of expertise. But I want to tell you that we are very actively working on this because we want to find a way to reopen further.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) People are very impatient around this. And let us now turn to the audience and give the floor to the youth. First question from Fatima, from the south. She’s 18 years old. A question around the importation of the racial issue into France.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) Hello. Thank you for listening to me. Xenophobia and racism are on the rise on both sides of the Atlantic. What are the reasons, and how does the U.S. face such violence?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) Yes, this is the main topic these days, one of the main topics, unfortunately. We have this experience and we witness this here, too. And there are some very substantial issues that are hard to face. For instance – we could speak about it for an hour or two. For instance, we talk about the role of media and social media. A little time ago in France and the U.S., there was almost a monopoly of the media; there were big groups controlling the media, three main channels, a few national newspapers like <em>The New York Times</em>, and everybody got their information through those channels. And now, in the past 10 to 15 years, we have seen more democracy or information media being larger, but this also creates issues because there is no middle man anymore to check or limit access. Because we deeply believe in freedom of expression, but in the past when there was some excess or exaggeration, we could do something. But now with social media and the large platforms, they are not based on the same law than newspapers, for example. So that’s a question.</p>
<p>So how can we manage this without restricting freedom of expression? That’s an issue. But there are some deeper issues as well, and we are also witnessing in our societies issues with people that are left behind. These people don’t feel like they are being heard, that they are seen, and that people are taking care of them. And sometimes they express this issue, unfortunately, through hatred and even through violence. And we need to look into this as well.</p>
<p>But ultimately, most importantly, we must be able to respond to this and not accept such actions, such expressions, and this starts with national leaders but it’s not enough; this must also come from the society as a whole, and I hope from your generation. Because what we’re seeing – and that’s what makes it difficult these days – if you look at progress over the past 15 or 20 years, there is clearly progress in terms of security, opportunities, and even tolerance. And those of your generation are much more tolerant than my generation. So you need to speak out, to say what is acceptable and what is not. And in a democracy, we need to listen to you. And this speech, this way to speak on social networks, is also very important, and we must listen to those voices as well.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE</strong>: An opportunity to speak about social media, let me remind you, we are with Antony Blinken, Secretary of State.</p>
<p>In a year, there will be elections in France. Regardless of the result, will you keep the same relationship with France?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) I don’t want to speak about French politics. But I can tell you that for a long time now, regardless of the government – in the U.S. or in France – we have acted together, we continue to do so, and as long as we work based on the same values, which is the link between us. The question is: Should Marine Le Pen be elected in 2022? I don’t want to speak on assumptions. I am very much focused on the present time, on now, and we are working remarkably with France.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Lea from Bordeaux has a question, has to do with the defiance towards politicians.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) Conspiracy theories are prospering in the U.S. Does – do you think that you can regain the confidence of citizens in the face of this growing defiance?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) This is a key question, indeed. The answer is fairly simple, in a way, even though it’s difficult to implement. There is a democratic depression that has lasted for 10 years, or even 15. We’re seeing a democratic withdrawal, so to speak, in most countries, including the most democratic ones. And it is very clear there is a lack of confidence, sometimes in democracy itself. And the answer is to show that democracies can deliver for their citizens and for the citizens around the world outside of those countries. So that is the challenge of our time, to show that democracies can act, and act in such a way as to improve the living conditions of our citizens. If we do this, and we yield results, and if the large majority of our citizens can see progress, and if their governments can take into account their wants and needs, I believe that we will see a new wave of support for the system.</p>
<p>However, if this does not happen, the crisis that is ongoing at the moment runs the risk of getting worse. And I’ll get – go back to what I said earlier: We will be more efficient in terms of yielding results if we work jointly, if countries work together, and if we cooperate within countries also. A government is not enough. Most of the problems that we’re facing require a response from the government, of course, but also from the – from civil society, from the private sector, from NGOs and so forth, more than ever. Those of us who work within government have an obligation to broaden the way we work. It is not enough to work amongst ourselves or with other governments. We need to focus on other ways and means, and to make sure that others are heard, and take part in the creation of our approaches. If we succeed, I think we will see a new impetus for democracy.</p>
<p>But the question that we are seeing now in autocracies is, well, we have a better capacity to act in an efficient manner to fulfill the needs of our people, and democracies are collapsing. Well, our job is to show that it is quite the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) You were talking about social media and freedom of speech; there’s a question here. Trump was banned from Facebook; do you believe that this is against freedom of speech?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) I don’t want to speak on this, to this particular matter involving the president, President Trump. We talked about this briefly earlier; there is a challenge in the – indeed, that is very difficult to tackle, that has to do with balancing freedom of speech on social media. Where does the responsibility lie? Is it with the government? Is it with the platforms themselves? How do we manage this while maintaining this principle of freedom of speech?</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) So what is your position on this?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) Personally, I’m leaning in favor of freedom of – the freedom of speech, and I think we should fight against bad ideas with good ideas. But I’d be the first to admit that this is not so simple.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) So in the case of Donald Trump, the fact that it is a private company that says, well, this person can no longer speak out, isn’t this sort of a democratic issue?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) Well, yes, indeed, it is a democratic issue at stake here, but in our constitutional system the government overall does not have the right to restrain people’s freedom of speech. It’s different for a private company. They have more of a margin, constitutionally speaking. But this being said, the principle remains fundamental.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) So does this mean that we need a reform?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) Well, once again, this is above my pay grade. I’m in charge of working on managing foreign policy, but as a citizen, as an American citizen and as a citizen of the world, since social media is a world in and of itself, I believe that we need to find a way to manage this issue with the utmost respect for freedom of speech.</p>
<p>At the same time, when it comes to social media, it’s a little bit simplistic to say, “Well, social media is just here to assure technical support; we’re not in charge of the editorial content, and we’re not responsible.” In my opinion, this is going a bit too far. The way the conversation is managed, with the algorithms that are used, all of this has a profound impact on content and on what people see and listen on social media, and what they don’t see or don’t hear on social media. I believe that social media companies need to assume part of the responsibility. When the government enters this realm, then there are regulations involved, and sometimes it can go a bit too far. It’s best to get your results that will come out of the social media themselves.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) We have a question from Laura.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) Recently on American bases, certain flags have been banned, including the Confederate flag, seen as racist. This new ban also includes the LGBT flag. Does this ban send an alarming message?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) I’m responsible for the Secretary of State, and we have now the possibility for each embassy or each head of mission to show the flag, including the LGBTQ flag. This decision was made a few months ago. With regards to our diplomatic foreign missions, this is part of the scope of responsibility of our ambassadors. I cannot speak in the name of our colleagues from the Department of Defense or Pentagon. They have had a rule for a long time now that says that the only flag outside of the American flag that can be shown is the one that is a symbol of the American soldiers that are combat.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) We have now a question from Jean around the Uyghurs. He’s 17, coming from Maubeuge in the north.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) The U.S. have been mobilized against the violations of the Uyghurs’ rights in China. You, for instance, banned cotton importations from Xinjiang. Are these restrictions enough?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) That’s an excellent question. And one could answer no, because if the result is not here – that is, stopping the abuse against the Uyghurs – one could say that this is not enough, because what matters is the result. That being said, there are two important aspects when we witness human rights violations, including such serious violations as seen in Xinjiang. We need to at least speak out; not only speak out but taking action with the available means. And in that regard, we shouldn’t be complicit with this situation, hence, the idea of trying to make sure that products that are made with the workers in Xinjiang cannot be imported. And we must also make sure that our countries do not export technologies to China, technologies that could be used to control those communities.</p>
<p>But it’s more complicated than this. I am – I admit that sanctions are an important tool, but it can also have perverted consequences. For instance, if because of those sanctions the life of those we’re are trying to help gets worse because they are not able to make a living or they do not have access to certain products, including humanitarian products, we must raise that question and we must look into the issue specifically and always ask ourselves the question: Does our action overall have a positive or a negative impact?</p>
<p>But with the current situation, which is ongoing right now in Xinjiang against the Uyghurs, we should at least as an international community to shed a light on what is happening, to clearly speak out and say this is not acceptable, and through sanctions, to try at least to pressure those who are leading such policy, change their policy.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) Well, actually, we’ve heard that those sanctions might not be efficient, so how far are the U.S. ready to go on this issue?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) I don’t want to get into hypotheticals. The situation is ongoing and what we’ve seen over the last few months is that more and more countries are speaking out and acting together, including by way of coordinated sanctions.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) Some people are saying maybe it’s not going as far as it should because you’re in the face of China; it’s a large economic power, while the reality is that we cannot avoid China, it’s the reality.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) At various levels we need to engage with China and I hope that this engagement can lead to a policy change, but at the same time, we are using the tools at our disposal to try and show that the policy carried out by the Chinese Government has a cost for China itself as well in terms of their political and diplomatic isolation, and also a cost that could potentially be economic as well.</p>
<p>On various challenges and issues, the reality is that there is rarely – sometimes there is, but there’s rarely an easy and quick answer as if you were just flipping on a switch. It just doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) So we answered the questions by those who asked about this – many people asked. Don’t hesitate to ask your questions, we will ask them. We will now be giving the floor to Safwan (ph), who is 17 years old and who is from (inaudible) in the Paris region.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Via interpreter) In May, you went to Israel and to the West Bank. How can the U.S. – or how do the U.S. intend to work towards peace in the region?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) This is a question that is timely today that we could have also asked last year, five years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago – the question doesn’t go away, because the solution is still not there. At first, we had a major issue, the conflict in Gaza. We wanted to put an end to violence as soon as possible, which is what we did. Lots of damage, lots of human loss, but the violence did end and at the moment there are immediate challenges with humanitarian assistance for those who live in Gaza, but there’s also a need to reconstruct Gaza. All of this is ongoing at the moment.</p>
<p>Avoiding in the days, weeks, and months to come any type of provocation or sticking points that could give way to new bouts of violence is another focus of ours, and we also want to work on establishing more confidence and trust between Palestinian and Israelis in order to put in place conditions that are not currently in place to lead to a potential peace process and the establishment of a two-state solution. At this moment in time, these conditions are not in place and we need to work on them, and that is what we’ll do. But in the immediate future, what we need to do is to help the people of Gaza who were caught in the crossfires.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, the U.S. has reestablished its diplomatic relations with the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people through humanitarian and economic support, as well as defense and security support. And we are in the process of reopening our consulate, which was closed a few years ago. This is an ongoing process; it takes some time, but it starts with a recommitment on the part of the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) We can now move on to a question by Illian (ph) who is 18 years old and is from Toulouse.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Via interpreter) The question is around democracies in South America and Central America that are threatened, pushing many people to leave their country. Joe Biden had promised for a more humane immigration policy. By which concrete ways can this be achieved?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) Yes, this is an issue that we face almost on a daily basis, but let’s take a step back. Men, women, children who try to come to the U.S. don’t do it because they just wake up one day and think, “Wouldn’t it be nice today to leave everything I’ve known behind –my family, my country, my language, my friends, my town – take an incredibly dangerous trip, be at the hands of traffickers, and end up at the American border which is actually closed? That would be a good way to spend my day.” No. To get to that, there must be certain conditions where there is no alternative, that only the – almost the only way to survive is to leave. And in order to address this issue I think we must resolve those conditions, what pushes people to leave everything they’ve ever known to go to the U.S. or to go to Mexico, et cetera.</p>
<p>And this is President Biden’s policy. We are implementing a program to address what pushes these people to take that trip. Deep issues around security, around governance, corruption, and most importantly, a lack of opportunities. If you don’t have the minimum ability to make a living, to feed your children, then you go to something else.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Via interpreter) Well, actually a question around what Vice President Kamala Harris said, which shocked a few people in Guatemala saying to the people, “Do not come.” Do you think this is a mistake?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) No. People must understand that the border is currently closed. So having these people risking their life at the hands of traffickers and putting themselves in danger only to realize that there is no access, then we must be very clear because some very dishonest people who are trafficking people are trying to say even through social media, they’re trying to say, “Come, the U.S. are open. You can come and we’ll help you for $5,000.” So she wanted to be very clear on this, and it’s important people hear that. But at the same time we have a tradition, which is also a French tradition despite the difficulties that we are both facing. The tradition is to say, “If people want to seek asylum, then they can do it, and we will study their case. And should they meet the criteria, we can let them in the U.S.”</p>
<p>Same for refugees. We have this amazing tradition, which is to welcome refugees. We have lost that a little recently, but we are trying to rebuild our capacities on this topic. And we need also a functioning system, because the existing system as you seek asylum in the U.S. is absolutely overwhelmed by demand and we are unable to manage that. So we not only need to act on what pushes people to take the trip, but also acting on the resources available to study those cases and see if somebody can come to our country.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) Let’s move on to the Brut questions. I would like to thank you all for your comments. We are going to take those 10 to 15 minutes to ask a few questions from the comments. We have quite a few. We launched some contribution from yesterday, many questions around Julian Assange. He is facing extradition in the U.S. There have been many calls in France and Europe to drop the charges against him. What do you want to answer to this?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) It’s not easy for me speak around this issue. There is ongoing legal process, so I will let that legal process continue. I understand the questions, the emotions around this case, but I cannot really speak on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE</strong>: (Via interpreter) Yes, this is quite recurrent, and the question was around how come a whistleblower does not get much protection because this has been a recurrent issue for several years, this issue around extradition.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) I understand the question. I understand the emotions. But I must let the legal system work.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE</strong>: (Via interpreter) Is that something raised by your administration?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) Probably because this is ongoing case.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Ongoing, okay. Another question from Danny (ph) in the comments. “Do you intend on closing Guantanamo? We know you wanted to, but what’s the timeline? We – even during other mandates, we heard about closing Guantanamo, but when will that be done?”</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong> (Via interpreter) The simple answer is yes. This is part of our policy and we are working on this. There are still around 40 inmates at Guantanamo, and when you have that type of number – 40, not hundreds – then by definition these are the most complex cases. However, we are actively working on this at the moment. We are trying to find a way to act on each individual case.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Could you make a commitment now that Guantanamo will be closed by the end?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) That’s our objective, but I cannot guarantee that or provide a date. But that’s definitely the objective.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) So to sum up, your objective is to have Guantanamo closed by the end of the mandate?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) Yes. I wish it could faster than this, but unfortunately it’s complicated. For example, in certain cases you need to find a country that is ready to welcome the person in question. It’s not easy. This requires a lot of diplomacy. And on our part – this might sound weird but if, let’s say, you’re considering sending somebody from Guantanamo to another country in order to close Guantanamo, we must have a guarantee that the rights of these people will be protected in that country. That’s not easy either.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Another question on Instagram on an issue that we handle on a daily basis. It has to do with climate change. What is the policy of the Biden administration on climate change?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) On the first day of our administration, we rejoined the Paris Accords. It was symbolic but it was also important on the substance. President Biden convened a summit on climate in April, just three months after getting into office. He gathered a large majority of those leaders that have the most impact or can have the most impact on climate with a view to having a wider sense of the situation and to also elevate the climate issue. We are currently working towards COP26, which will be held in the U.K. at the end of the year.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that are important. At the same time, we – with this, which is what we’re trying to do – we must right away, not in 2040, not in 2045, but as of now, this year, but especially this decade is to save our capital because the goals for 2050 will not be attainable if we’re not able to act within this decade, and we’ll never be able to get back the capital that we use. We’ve seen countries that were sort of leaning back and that have now become more involved.</p>
<p>And the second point is that we need a large amount of financing in order to help those countries that do not have the capabilities to do so. For example, to acquire expensive technology or to improve their resilience in the face of climate impacts. There is a fund that we have contributed to and we will continue to do so, and we are trying to make sure that other countries do the same.</p>
<p>On many specific details our government is acting. We’re trying to do this by showing by example. I’ll just dwell on this for a couple of minutes if I may.</p>
<p>There are no big issues that have a bigger impact on our lives that can be managed without cooperation between countries. Climate is one of those. The U.S. is responsible for about 15 percent of emissions in the world. If we did everything perfectly at home, there remains 85 percent of the problem in other countries that need to be managed. And we are trying to do this in a joint manner with the other emitters.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) Right after this meeting – and actually there is one last question: You are going to meet the President of the republic Emmanuel Macron. What will you be covering together?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) The problem is that we have so many things to cover and that we’re working on. We could spend hours. I just spent – I was meant to spend 45 minutes with my friend and colleague Jean-Yves Le Drian, the minister of foreign affairs, but we actually spent 90 minutes together and we could have gone longer.</p>
<p>We’ve done a great deal of work within the G7 at the summit, the NATO summit, and at the EU-U.S. summit as well as when President Biden and President Macron met. Our current mission is to continue this work, to continue exchanging on the next steps. For example, at the G7 summit we worked together in order to ensure that 1 billion doses of COVID vaccines would be distributed throughout the world. Now we’re working on how we can work together to increase production capacity in other countries, namely in Africa, and I know this is something that will be brought up because President Macron is a leader on this. And we will also talk about security in the Sahel and so forth. There are many different issues. Many things.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) What topic did you not cover here that you might be covering with the president?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) In a way, everything is on the agenda. But what I’d like to underscore first and foremost is what President Biden said when he met President Macron during the G7 summit: Not only do we want but also we need to work together. France is our longest-standing ally. As soon as we became independent and even before, France was at our side and this is still the case today. And I’m confident that in next – rather, I’m confident with the work that we’ve been doing in the first six months. And today, we will continue working together.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Many people are watching us and are seeing that your French is stellar. Thank you to the 34 young people who came here from all over France, including the six individuals who posed questions. Thank you to those who watched us. You are used to the way this works. It will be available in replay mode and we will be back soon. Have a great day and see you soon on Brut.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Paris, France</p>
<p>Chief of Mission Residence</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Hello, everyone. We are live on – with Antony Blinken, the new Secretary of State of the Biden administration. Hello, Mr. Secretary of State. You are the voice of America in the world. You are actually on an official visit in Europe. You met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and you are going to meet French President Macron in a moment.</p>
<p>We are going to talk about several topics – the threats against democracy, police violence, climate, and racism. And to talk about this, we have 34 young people we invited to have a discussion with you. So you will answer their questions. But I’m talking to you, watching live. You can ask your questions in the comments section and we will try to relay a few of those. My phone is here and I’m reading the comments.</p>
<p>But first of all, Mr. Secretary of State, we will be able to have this discussion in French because you lived in France for a few years, correct?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) Indeed, I moved to France when I was nine. I used to live in New York. I lived here for nine years. I graduated high school here in Paris. I came back to Paris a couple years later to work. And I have friendships that started in school that are lasting, that have lasted over 50 years.</p>
<p>I’m delighted to be here to talk with all of you here today and those who are on the network. There’s an important reason why I wanted to have a dialogue such as this one. I believe that we’re faced with a challenge and also an opportunity. We’ll have to strengthen the links between our countries, and this will be done through you, whether it is through direct contact or on social media. You will be the ones who will build this partnership for the new generation. In my opinion, this is more important than ever. Our history is long-lasting, but it is particularly important today.</p>
<p>I think back to the challenges that we’re facing today, issues that affect all of our lives: the pandemic, COVID, the climate challenge, the impact of technology, new technology just as we’re seeing today. This impact can be good but not always – just like any topic that has an impact on your lives. And what we can see is that whether it is in France or in the U.S., a country that acts alone does not have the ability to face challenges on its own. And that goes for opportunities as well. We cannot build a wall high enough, we cannot build a solid wall to stop this from happening.</p>
<p>More than ever, I think that today there is a need for us to find a way to cooperate between countries so that we can work and act together. This ability is made possible by the ties that link our countries through our mutual values. And those relationships are living. The relationships are made by artistic pursuits, and by trade, and by working individuals. So for me, this is also an opportunity to listen to you, and to see what is important to you, and how you’re seeing the future of our relationships and of our ability to work together.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) We are getting many questions in the comments. It’s true that you are lucky enough to be with us today, but us French still cannot go to the U.S. So one question: When will the borders reopen?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) I cannot give a date but I hope it will be soon. As we do in democracies, we have set up a working group with the EU in order to come back again to this freedom of travel. But we must be guided by science, by the experts in the medical field. We shouldn’t take political decisions, but decisions based on facts and data. I hope this will be very soon. We really want this. I hope it will be in the coming weeks, not months.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Yes, what would be the timeline? Can we imagine going to the U.S. during this summer for holidays?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) I hope so. I cannot provide a date. But we must be careful. We are seeing that we think we’re – we have security, but then there is a new variant of the virus spreading. We see this in certain European countries. We have that same variant, the Delta variant in the U.S. So we really have that desire to reopen quickly, but this needs to be based on facts and science.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Maybe there will be criteria for vaccinated people?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) The experts are looking into it. I think there are different possibilities. I don’t want to talk too much about this. This is not my area of expertise. But I want to tell you that we are very actively working on this because we want to find a way to reopen further.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) People are very impatient around this. And let us now turn to the audience and give the floor to the youth. First question from Fatima, from the south. She’s 18 years old. A question around the importation of the racial issue into France.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) Hello. Thank you for listening to me. Xenophobia and racism are on the rise on both sides of the Atlantic. What are the reasons, and how does the U.S. face such violence?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) Yes, this is the main topic these days, one of the main topics, unfortunately. We have this experience and we witness this here, too. And there are some very substantial issues that are hard to face. For instance – we could speak about it for an hour or two. For instance, we talk about the role of media and social media. A little time ago in France and the U.S., there was almost a monopoly of the media; there were big groups controlling the media, three main channels, a few national newspapers like <em>The New York Times</em>, and everybody got their information through those channels. And now, in the past 10 to 15 years, we have seen more democracy or information media being larger, but this also creates issues because there is no middle man anymore to check or limit access. Because we deeply believe in freedom of expression, but in the past when there was some excess or exaggeration, we could do something. But now with social media and the large platforms, they are not based on the same law than newspapers, for example. So that’s a question.</p>
<p>So how can we manage this without restricting freedom of expression? That’s an issue. But there are some deeper issues as well, and we are also witnessing in our societies issues with people that are left behind. These people don’t feel like they are being heard, that they are seen, and that people are taking care of them. And sometimes they express this issue, unfortunately, through hatred and even through violence. And we need to look into this as well.</p>
<p>But ultimately, most importantly, we must be able to respond to this and not accept such actions, such expressions, and this starts with national leaders but it’s not enough; this must also come from the society as a whole, and I hope from your generation. Because what we’re seeing – and that’s what makes it difficult these days – if you look at progress over the past 15 or 20 years, there is clearly progress in terms of security, opportunities, and even tolerance. And those of your generation are much more tolerant than my generation. So you need to speak out, to say what is acceptable and what is not. And in a democracy, we need to listen to you. And this speech, this way to speak on social networks, is also very important, and we must listen to those voices as well.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE</strong>: An opportunity to speak about social media, let me remind you, we are with Antony Blinken, Secretary of State.</p>
<p>In a year, there will be elections in France. Regardless of the result, will you keep the same relationship with France?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) I don’t want to speak about French politics. But I can tell you that for a long time now, regardless of the government – in the U.S. or in France – we have acted together, we continue to do so, and as long as we work based on the same values, which is the link between us. The question is: Should Marine Le Pen be elected in 2022? I don’t want to speak on assumptions. I am very much focused on the present time, on now, and we are working remarkably with France.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Lea from Bordeaux has a question, has to do with the defiance towards politicians.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) Conspiracy theories are prospering in the U.S. Does – do you think that you can regain the confidence of citizens in the face of this growing defiance?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) This is a key question, indeed. The answer is fairly simple, in a way, even though it’s difficult to implement. There is a democratic depression that has lasted for 10 years, or even 15. We’re seeing a democratic withdrawal, so to speak, in most countries, including the most democratic ones. And it is very clear there is a lack of confidence, sometimes in democracy itself. And the answer is to show that democracies can deliver for their citizens and for the citizens around the world outside of those countries. So that is the challenge of our time, to show that democracies can act, and act in such a way as to improve the living conditions of our citizens. If we do this, and we yield results, and if the large majority of our citizens can see progress, and if their governments can take into account their wants and needs, I believe that we will see a new wave of support for the system.</p>
<p>However, if this does not happen, the crisis that is ongoing at the moment runs the risk of getting worse. And I’ll get – go back to what I said earlier: We will be more efficient in terms of yielding results if we work jointly, if countries work together, and if we cooperate within countries also. A government is not enough. Most of the problems that we’re facing require a response from the government, of course, but also from the – from civil society, from the private sector, from NGOs and so forth, more than ever. Those of us who work within government have an obligation to broaden the way we work. It is not enough to work amongst ourselves or with other governments. We need to focus on other ways and means, and to make sure that others are heard, and take part in the creation of our approaches. If we succeed, I think we will see a new impetus for democracy.</p>
<p>But the question that we are seeing now in autocracies is, well, we have a better capacity to act in an efficient manner to fulfill the needs of our people, and democracies are collapsing. Well, our job is to show that it is quite the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) You were talking about social media and freedom of speech; there’s a question here. Trump was banned from Facebook; do you believe that this is against freedom of speech?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) I don’t want to speak on this, to this particular matter involving the president, President Trump. We talked about this briefly earlier; there is a challenge in the – indeed, that is very difficult to tackle, that has to do with balancing freedom of speech on social media. Where does the responsibility lie? Is it with the government? Is it with the platforms themselves? How do we manage this while maintaining this principle of freedom of speech?</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) So what is your position on this?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) Personally, I’m leaning in favor of freedom of – the freedom of speech, and I think we should fight against bad ideas with good ideas. But I’d be the first to admit that this is not so simple.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) So in the case of Donald Trump, the fact that it is a private company that says, well, this person can no longer speak out, isn’t this sort of a democratic issue?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) Well, yes, indeed, it is a democratic issue at stake here, but in our constitutional system the government overall does not have the right to restrain people’s freedom of speech. It’s different for a private company. They have more of a margin, constitutionally speaking. But this being said, the principle remains fundamental.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) So does this mean that we need a reform?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) Well, once again, this is above my pay grade. I’m in charge of working on managing foreign policy, but as a citizen, as an American citizen and as a citizen of the world, since social media is a world in and of itself, I believe that we need to find a way to manage this issue with the utmost respect for freedom of speech.</p>
<p>At the same time, when it comes to social media, it’s a little bit simplistic to say, “Well, social media is just here to assure technical support; we’re not in charge of the editorial content, and we’re not responsible.” In my opinion, this is going a bit too far. The way the conversation is managed, with the algorithms that are used, all of this has a profound impact on content and on what people see and listen on social media, and what they don’t see or don’t hear on social media. I believe that social media companies need to assume part of the responsibility. When the government enters this realm, then there are regulations involved, and sometimes it can go a bit too far. It’s best to get your results that will come out of the social media themselves.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) We have a question from Laura.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) Recently on American bases, certain flags have been banned, including the Confederate flag, seen as racist. This new ban also includes the LGBT flag. Does this ban send an alarming message?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) I’m responsible for the Secretary of State, and we have now the possibility for each embassy or each head of mission to show the flag, including the LGBTQ flag. This decision was made a few months ago. With regards to our diplomatic foreign missions, this is part of the scope of responsibility of our ambassadors. I cannot speak in the name of our colleagues from the Department of Defense or Pentagon. They have had a rule for a long time now that says that the only flag outside of the American flag that can be shown is the one that is a symbol of the American soldiers that are combat.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) We have now a question from Jean around the Uyghurs. He’s 17, coming from Maubeuge in the north.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Via interpreter) The U.S. have been mobilized against the violations of the Uyghurs’ rights in China. You, for instance, banned cotton importations from Xinjiang. Are these restrictions enough?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) That’s an excellent question. And one could answer no, because if the result is not here – that is, stopping the abuse against the Uyghurs – one could say that this is not enough, because what matters is the result. That being said, there are two important aspects when we witness human rights violations, including such serious violations as seen in Xinjiang. We need to at least speak out; not only speak out but taking action with the available means. And in that regard, we shouldn’t be complicit with this situation, hence, the idea of trying to make sure that products that are made with the workers in Xinjiang cannot be imported. And we must also make sure that our countries do not export technologies to China, technologies that could be used to control those communities.</p>
<p>But it’s more complicated than this. I am – I admit that sanctions are an important tool, but it can also have perverted consequences. For instance, if because of those sanctions the life of those we’re are trying to help gets worse because they are not able to make a living or they do not have access to certain products, including humanitarian products, we must raise that question and we must look into the issue specifically and always ask ourselves the question: Does our action overall have a positive or a negative impact?</p>
<p>But with the current situation, which is ongoing right now in Xinjiang against the Uyghurs, we should at least as an international community to shed a light on what is happening, to clearly speak out and say this is not acceptable, and through sanctions, to try at least to pressure those who are leading such policy, change their policy.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) Well, actually, we’ve heard that those sanctions might not be efficient, so how far are the U.S. ready to go on this issue?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) I don’t want to get into hypotheticals. The situation is ongoing and what we’ve seen over the last few months is that more and more countries are speaking out and acting together, including by way of coordinated sanctions.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) Some people are saying maybe it’s not going as far as it should because you’re in the face of China; it’s a large economic power, while the reality is that we cannot avoid China, it’s the reality.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) At various levels we need to engage with China and I hope that this engagement can lead to a policy change, but at the same time, we are using the tools at our disposal to try and show that the policy carried out by the Chinese Government has a cost for China itself as well in terms of their political and diplomatic isolation, and also a cost that could potentially be economic as well.</p>
<p>On various challenges and issues, the reality is that there is rarely – sometimes there is, but there’s rarely an easy and quick answer as if you were just flipping on a switch. It just doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) So we answered the questions by those who asked about this – many people asked. Don’t hesitate to ask your questions, we will ask them. We will now be giving the floor to Safwan (ph), who is 17 years old and who is from (inaudible) in the Paris region.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Via interpreter) In May, you went to Israel and to the West Bank. How can the U.S. – or how do the U.S. intend to work towards peace in the region?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) This is a question that is timely today that we could have also asked last year, five years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago – the question doesn’t go away, because the solution is still not there. At first, we had a major issue, the conflict in Gaza. We wanted to put an end to violence as soon as possible, which is what we did. Lots of damage, lots of human loss, but the violence did end and at the moment there are immediate challenges with humanitarian assistance for those who live in Gaza, but there’s also a need to reconstruct Gaza. All of this is ongoing at the moment.</p>
<p>Avoiding in the days, weeks, and months to come any type of provocation or sticking points that could give way to new bouts of violence is another focus of ours, and we also want to work on establishing more confidence and trust between Palestinian and Israelis in order to put in place conditions that are not currently in place to lead to a potential peace process and the establishment of a two-state solution. At this moment in time, these conditions are not in place and we need to work on them, and that is what we’ll do. But in the immediate future, what we need to do is to help the people of Gaza who were caught in the crossfires.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, the U.S. has reestablished its diplomatic relations with the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people through humanitarian and economic support, as well as defense and security support. And we are in the process of reopening our consulate, which was closed a few years ago. This is an ongoing process; it takes some time, but it starts with a recommitment on the part of the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) We can now move on to a question by Illian (ph) who is 18 years old and is from Toulouse.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Via interpreter) The question is around democracies in South America and Central America that are threatened, pushing many people to leave their country. Joe Biden had promised for a more humane immigration policy. By which concrete ways can this be achieved?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) Yes, this is an issue that we face almost on a daily basis, but let’s take a step back. Men, women, children who try to come to the U.S. don’t do it because they just wake up one day and think, “Wouldn’t it be nice today to leave everything I’ve known behind –my family, my country, my language, my friends, my town – take an incredibly dangerous trip, be at the hands of traffickers, and end up at the American border which is actually closed? That would be a good way to spend my day.” No. To get to that, there must be certain conditions where there is no alternative, that only the – almost the only way to survive is to leave. And in order to address this issue I think we must resolve those conditions, what pushes people to leave everything they’ve ever known to go to the U.S. or to go to Mexico, et cetera.</p>
<p>And this is President Biden’s policy. We are implementing a program to address what pushes these people to take that trip. Deep issues around security, around governance, corruption, and most importantly, a lack of opportunities. If you don’t have the minimum ability to make a living, to feed your children, then you go to something else.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>(Via interpreter) Well, actually a question around what Vice President Kamala Harris said, which shocked a few people in Guatemala saying to the people, “Do not come.” Do you think this is a mistake?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) No. People must understand that the border is currently closed. So having these people risking their life at the hands of traffickers and putting themselves in danger only to realize that there is no access, then we must be very clear because some very dishonest people who are trafficking people are trying to say even through social media, they’re trying to say, “Come, the U.S. are open. You can come and we’ll help you for $5,000.” So she wanted to be very clear on this, and it’s important people hear that. But at the same time we have a tradition, which is also a French tradition despite the difficulties that we are both facing. The tradition is to say, “If people want to seek asylum, then they can do it, and we will study their case. And should they meet the criteria, we can let them in the U.S.”</p>
<p>Same for refugees. We have this amazing tradition, which is to welcome refugees. We have lost that a little recently, but we are trying to rebuild our capacities on this topic. And we need also a functioning system, because the existing system as you seek asylum in the U.S. is absolutely overwhelmed by demand and we are unable to manage that. So we not only need to act on what pushes people to take the trip, but also acting on the resources available to study those cases and see if somebody can come to our country.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) Let’s move on to the Brut questions. I would like to thank you all for your comments. We are going to take those 10 to 15 minutes to ask a few questions from the comments. We have quite a few. We launched some contribution from yesterday, many questions around Julian Assange. He is facing extradition in the U.S. There have been many calls in France and Europe to drop the charges against him. What do you want to answer to this?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> (Via interpreter) It’s not easy for me speak around this issue. There is ongoing legal process, so I will let that legal process continue. I understand the questions, the emotions around this case, but I cannot really speak on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE</strong>: (Via interpreter) Yes, this is quite recurrent, and the question was around how come a whistleblower does not get much protection because this has been a recurrent issue for several years, this issue around extradition.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) I understand the question. I understand the emotions. But I must let the legal system work.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE</strong>: (Via interpreter) Is that something raised by your administration?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) Probably because this is ongoing case.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Ongoing, okay. Another question from Danny (ph) in the comments. “Do you intend on closing Guantanamo? We know you wanted to, but what’s the timeline? We – even during other mandates, we heard about closing Guantanamo, but when will that be done?”</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong> (Via interpreter) The simple answer is yes. This is part of our policy and we are working on this. There are still around 40 inmates at Guantanamo, and when you have that type of number – 40, not hundreds – then by definition these are the most complex cases. However, we are actively working on this at the moment. We are trying to find a way to act on each individual case.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Could you make a commitment now that Guantanamo will be closed by the end?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) That’s our objective, but I cannot guarantee that or provide a date. But that’s definitely the objective.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) So to sum up, your objective is to have Guantanamo closed by the end of the mandate?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) Yes. I wish it could faster than this, but unfortunately it’s complicated. For example, in certain cases you need to find a country that is ready to welcome the person in question. It’s not easy. This requires a lot of diplomacy. And on our part – this might sound weird but if, let’s say, you’re considering sending somebody from Guantanamo to another country in order to close Guantanamo, we must have a guarantee that the rights of these people will be protected in that country. That’s not easy either.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Another question on Instagram on an issue that we handle on a daily basis. It has to do with climate change. What is the policy of the Biden administration on climate change?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) On the first day of our administration, we rejoined the Paris Accords. It was symbolic but it was also important on the substance. President Biden convened a summit on climate in April, just three months after getting into office. He gathered a large majority of those leaders that have the most impact or can have the most impact on climate with a view to having a wider sense of the situation and to also elevate the climate issue. We are currently working towards COP26, which will be held in the U.K. at the end of the year.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that are important. At the same time, we – with this, which is what we’re trying to do – we must right away, not in 2040, not in 2045, but as of now, this year, but especially this decade is to save our capital because the goals for 2050 will not be attainable if we’re not able to act within this decade, and we’ll never be able to get back the capital that we use. We’ve seen countries that were sort of leaning back and that have now become more involved.</p>
<p>And the second point is that we need a large amount of financing in order to help those countries that do not have the capabilities to do so. For example, to acquire expensive technology or to improve their resilience in the face of climate impacts. There is a fund that we have contributed to and we will continue to do so, and we are trying to make sure that other countries do the same.</p>
<p>On many specific details our government is acting. We’re trying to do this by showing by example. I’ll just dwell on this for a couple of minutes if I may.</p>
<p>There are no big issues that have a bigger impact on our lives that can be managed without cooperation between countries. Climate is one of those. The U.S. is responsible for about 15 percent of emissions in the world. If we did everything perfectly at home, there remains 85 percent of the problem in other countries that need to be managed. And we are trying to do this in a joint manner with the other emitters.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) Right after this meeting – and actually there is one last question: You are going to meet the President of the republic Emmanuel Macron. What will you be covering together?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) The problem is that we have so many things to cover and that we’re working on. We could spend hours. I just spent – I was meant to spend 45 minutes with my friend and colleague Jean-Yves Le Drian, the minister of foreign affairs, but we actually spent 90 minutes together and we could have gone longer.</p>
<p>We’ve done a great deal of work within the G7 at the summit, the NATO summit, and at the EU-U.S. summit as well as when President Biden and President Macron met. Our current mission is to continue this work, to continue exchanging on the next steps. For example, at the G7 summit we worked together in order to ensure that 1 billion doses of COVID vaccines would be distributed throughout the world. Now we’re working on how we can work together to increase production capacity in other countries, namely in Africa, and I know this is something that will be brought up because President Macron is a leader on this. And we will also talk about security in the Sahel and so forth. There are many different issues. Many things.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE: </strong>(Via interpreter) What topic did you not cover here that you might be covering with the president?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN: </strong>(Via interpreter) In a way, everything is on the agenda. But what I’d like to underscore first and foremost is what President Biden said when he met President Macron during the G7 summit: Not only do we want but also we need to work together. France is our longest-standing ally. As soon as we became independent and even before, France was at our side and this is still the case today. And I’m confident that in next – rather, I’m confident with the work that we’ve been doing in the first six months. And today, we will continue working together.</p>
<p><strong>MR BUISINE:</strong> (Via interpreter) Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Many people are watching us and are seeing that your French is stellar. Thank you to the 34 young people who came here from all over France, including the six individuals who posed questions. Thank you to those who watched us. You are used to the way this works. It will be available in replay mode and we will be back soon. Have a great day and see you soon on Brut.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian</p>
<p>Paris, France</p>
<p>Quai d’Orsay</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LE DRIAN:</b> (Via interpreter) (In progress) Welcome back. It is excellent news for all of us that America is back. It has come back to the values that we share, come back to an imperative that we share, democracy. It has come back to multilateralism that we built together, and it is our responsibility to continue with it intensively.</p>
<p>These values, universal values, these democratic (inaudible) demand and this joint horizon, such are the foundations of what we share. And this is what France and the Europeans had to fight for alone far too often for four very long years against these attacks that continue. I’m very pleased that we are back together and we – that we can work together in order to preserve this international order based on cooperation and the law.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, together with Antony Blinken, we’ve been working in order to sustain this momentum by renewing a constant and confident – constant and confident dialogue which is indispensable for both our countries. Indispensable because the challenges that we face need all of our determination and all of our energy when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate emergency, the fight against the global inequalities. And the time as well, it is indispensable because we are, at the moment, witnessing an international life which is becoming more and more brittle. It is therefore a strategic imperative that we strengthen our alliance and meet at a bilateral level or within the relationship between the EU and the United States or within the balanced nature.</p>
<p>Like President Biden and yourself, you commended the efforts made by the Europeans within NATO to play their role. We all acknowledge that we are stronger together, stronger when it comes to fighting terrorism. And as you know, in the Sahel in particular and in the Levant and in the Sahel, we are undergoing a deep transformation of the French (inaudible) that is underway, and we’re very – like I told the Secretary of State, we very much wish the United States to continue to provide their support to the initiative.</p>
<p>We’re stronger as well when it comes to dealing with global crisis when that threatens our security interests. We were in Berlin two days ago, and we want to make sure that when it comes to Libya, we can obtain together the removal of the foreign forces, mercenaries, in compliance with the timeline for the political transition and in view of the elections on the 24th of December.</p>
<p>Stronger regarding Libya, but also on the Iranian matter, we are expecting the Iranian authorities to take the last decisions, probably difficult ones that will enable us to quickly come back to the full implementation of the Vienna accord.</p>
<p>It is true as well when it comes to the crisis in Lebanon, dear Tony, and I am pleased that this morning we noted not only that we share the same views, the same analysis of the situation: the terrible collapse of this country, the inability of the political leaders of this country to meet any aspect of the challenge. And we both also acknowledge that it would be such a tragedy if this country was to fall apart, would disappear. We noted all of that and we, ladies and gentlemen, decided to act together – to act together in order to exert pressure on those (inaudible). We know who they are, and it is not – the solution is not about immobility. So we agreed to take together some strong initiatives in order to unlock the situation. It is a matter of respect for the Lebanese people (inaudible) in order to preserve the stability of the Euro-Atlantic region, and some major decisions were taken on the occasion of the recent NATO summit. So we will be able to implement – to continue the strategic reflection initiated in 2019.</p>
<p>We will continue to feed the dialogue with Russia, particularly on arms control, and we share to that effect the same stance and approach of firmness made within NATO or within the European Union in order to continue our joint action.</p>
<p>We also talked about Armenia and Azerbaijan. We will continue to exchange on this matter and to coordinate our actions.</p>
<p>Being stronger, it’s also about being stronger in the Indo-Pacific region, which must absolutely remain a free and open space, and that requires a balanced approach vis-a-vis China. Of course, we discussed this matter as well in order to try and define this balance, and we agree on the necessity of our cooperation to adopt a lucid and pragmatic approach to what China means to us. That is, China is both a partner, a competitor, and a rival.</p>
<p>In addition, dear Tony, the relationship between France and the United States is a historic friendship, and we both, you and I, share some special responsibility. It is about respecting this background, but also keeping it alive.</p>
<p>And so to conclude, I have the pleasure of mentioning a beautiful project which (inaudible) couple of days, a network of (inaudible) on the American factory (inaudible) Albertine (inaudible) Villa Kujoyama in Kyoto. We will now have a Villa Albertine in the United States, but with a very new concept, (inaudible) to conclude my words to the press on this.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is a summary of our discussion this morning. We will continue our discussions in July on the occasion of my visit to the United States in mid-July, and we will have an opportunity to see each other again and to continue these very friendly and dense discussions on that occasion.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> (Via interpreter) Dear Jean-Yves, thank you for welcoming me so warmly. On a personal note, I would like to say how delighted I am to be here in France. It’s my second homeland, and I lived here for 10 years – over 10 years.</p>
<p>(In English) I’m also delighted that we were able to reunite so soon after the G7 at the NATO summit, the U.S.-EU Leaders Meeting. I think it’s a signal of how important, how foundational the friendship between France and the United States is to both our countries – our oldest ally and an alliance that we are now revitalizing even more for the challenges that we have to face, as you said, together.</p>
<p>As a kid in Paris, I learned how the values that the American people cherish are also cherished by the French. We throw these words around, but we actually give them meaning. France gives them meaning; the United States gives them meaning, at least on our best days – liberty, freedom of speech and thought, equality, every person’s right to be treated fairly and with dignity. I experienced how our cultures are so profoundly entwined, how French kids, at least when I was here, listened to American music. American kids watched French movies – actually now, French TV.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) The Bureau, Call My Agent, and Lupin.</p>
<p>(In English) If I have circles under my eyes, it’s because I stay up too late at night binge-watching these programs. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>And of course, I learned at a young age how much history our countries share, going back to the very start of the United States when France stood with us in our fight for freedom. Our partnership has been indispensable over so many years in meeting the challenges of the past. But it is, I think, even more indispensable now as we meet the challenges before us and that are having a real impact on the lives of our citizens, like stopping COVID-19, rising to the challenge of climate change, maintaining our joint security, defending our democratic values. As President Biden said again at the EU last week, the best way for our countries to deal with these challenges is by working together.</p>
<p>That includes through multilateralism. I’m visiting France, Germany, and Italy on this trip because, in addition to being our closest and strongest partners, these are also the only three countries that are members of the EU, NATO, and the G7. In the lead-up to the three summits and then at the summits themselves, our countries did important work together. And now we need to follow up on the steps we took – that’s exactly what we were doing this morning with the foreign minister and what I look forward to doing with President Macron later this afternoon – and also lay the groundwork for future collaborations. That includes our work at NATO to ensure the Alliance has the capabilities it needs to meet new threats, our agreement at the U.S.-EU summit to cooperate on setting the highest standards for trade and technology, and our work through the G7 to provide a billion vaccines to the world, to end support for coal-fired power plants, to move ahead on much-needed infrastructure development and projects in developing countries through the Build Back Better World initiative.</p>
<p>We very much look forward to working closely with our French counterparts and with France when France becomes president of the Council of the European Union in January. Jean-Yves, I think that’s an important moment for continuing to raise the level of ambition in the U.S.-EU relationship, and I think you agree with that proposition.</p>
<p>And as the foreign minister said, we are key partners together in dealing with regional and global security challenges. Together we’re going to support a sovereign, stable, unified, secure Libya, as we discussed together in Berlin just a couple of days ago. And we’ll see each other again in Rome in a couple of days to strengthen the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh and to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria, particularly through cross-border assistance.</p>
<p>We greatly value France’s leadership to counterterrorism in the Sahel region. We will continue to stand together in the Sahel. And with France, we’ll help our African partners work to address the drivers of economic, political, and social instability and bring security, stability, and good governance to their people.</p>
<p>We’re also working together to address the horrific violence and humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia and the governance and economic crisis in Lebanon, as Jean-Yves discussed. For over a year and a half, the Lebanese people have demanded transparency, accountability, and an end to the endemic corruption and mismanagement that is causing such hardship. The United States, France, the international community stand ready to help Lebanon – a Lebanon that is committed to meaningful change, but we need to see real leadership in Beirut.</p>
<p>And of course, we’re pursuing a shared approach to dealing with the challenges posed by China and Russia to the free and open rules-based international order.</p>
<p>Let me just briefly as well mention that, of course, we are very, very important economic partners. We’ll keep growing our trade and investment relationship. The United States is the largest foreign investor in France. We’re the top destination for French investment. Hundreds of thousands of Americans work for French companies, and vice versa. Deepening our economic ties will be critical not only for our economic recovery but also to our future competitiveness. And we’ll keep sustaining our people-to-people exchanges, and I am very enthusiastic about the initiative that Jean-Yves is launching. Thousands of American students come to France every year to study and discover for themselves how welcoming and, indeed, life-changing this country is, as I experienced myself. And we will continue to stand for our shared values of human rights and democracy around the world.</p>
<p>Democracies are facing new threats, also new opportunities. We have to bring together new ideas to the table to help democracies become more resilient, more effective at promoting representative, equitable societies. Together, we must and we will demonstrate that democracies can deliver for their citizens and for people around the world. I think that’s the challenge of our time. We have no better partner than France in pursuing it. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LE DRIAN:</b> (Via interpreter) Are you the moderator?</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b> (Via interpreter) Yes. First question, Virginie Robert from Les Echos on the French side.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) Good morning, Mr. Minister. You talked about the importance of the economic ties between France and the United States, which are very much troubled today by the impossibility of traveling to the United States. Could you please tell us when that will be possible again?</p>
<p>And Minister Le Drian, you talked about a more balanced relationship within NATO. Nonetheless, there are some stronger disagreements as to this organization. How – and China – how can you deal with that?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> With regard to travel, look, we are anxious to be able to restore travel as fully and as quickly as possible. We’re very much guided by the science, by our medical experts. That has to be the foundational principle on which we’re looking at this. We have a working group established with the European Union on this question, and all I can tell you – I can’t put a date on it. I can tell you we’re working very actively on this right now, and we are – like France, like our other partners in Europe – both anxious and looking forward to restoring travel. But we have to be guided by the science. We have to be guided by medical expertise.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LE DRIAN:</b> (Via interpreter) What was the question? (Inaudible) “Chinese-ation” of NATO? I was not aware of your concept because I can’t see the connection between the Atlantic Ocean and China. Is there a border? It is something very new today.</p>
<p>There were no disagreement between us as to the future of NATO, quite to the contrary, and I believe that this summit gives some – is a new start for NATO. It clearly identifies its purpose, putting back at the forefront our community of values, which are very much at the heart or the foundation of our Alliance, and saying as well – and that when we have a community of values, if there are some disagreements within the Alliance, they are to be dealt with based on the concept we agree upon. These values – you see who I am referring to – and we also agreed, as President Biden has said very strongly, that the European Union was a central element in the new relationship that we want to put in place within the Alliance when it comes to giving some new momentum to the Alliance. And we also agreed regarding the relationship with Russia.</p>
<p>As to China, I believe as well that things are clear between us. That was not the issue. Like I said earlier, we have a very close analysis with the three pillars I mentioned. We have both partners. China has partners, and we have to be partners when it comes to a number of issues, which are relevant to the entire planet. Given the importance of this country that – on climate, biodiversity, health, we are partners, but we’re also competitors because (inaudible) to a number of major economic, technological issues or innovation. We are competitors, so we had to make sure that we – our own interests are being respected and make sure that the same standards are applied on both sides so that it is fair.</p>
<p>And then we are rivals because on a number of topics, we (inaudible) to different models, ours and theirs. And in this respect, we stand very firm as to our demands, and I have in mind in particular the situation in the Xinjiang. This is it. So the three pillars will have to be combined depending on the particular point in time. The emergency or the focus might be more on one or another at different point in times, but we agreed to strike the right balance and – given that we share the same views on China. This is what I can tell you about China and NATO.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> Let me just add if I can, I think I wouldn’t have changed a word of what Jean-Yves just said. I think what we have seen, especially over the last few weeks, both at the G7, at NATO, and at the EU is a convergence of views on how to deal together with the challenges posed by China. And to the foreign minister’s point, we see it the same way. It’s, for all of us, a complicated relationship that has adversarial aspects, competitive ones, and cooperative ones. But the common denominator is that we’re going to be much more effective in engaging across these different aspects of the relationship if we do it together, and that’s what I think you saw come out of the three summits that we had, as well as the meeting between President Macron and President Biden.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b> Our first question goes to Shaun Tandon of the AFP.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you very much. Mr. Secretary, if I may begin, Afghanistan. President Ghani is in the United States today. There is an intelligence report warning that Kabul could fall as soon as six months after the U.S. withdrawal. How concerned are you about this? Is this motivating you to expedite contingency plans, particularly to protect the embassy and other U.S. interests?</p>
<p>If I may, can I ask both of you about Russia?</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) Mr. Minister, what is your message to European countries that are responding to the issue of a meeting with President Putin?</p>
<p>(In English.) And on the same question on Russia, President Macron has talked about having a seat at the table in arms talks with – to the United States and Russia. Does the United States support that? And would you support France and Germany moving along with Putin? Thanks.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> I’m happy to start. Let me just quickly start with the last question you asked. When it comes to strategic stability talks, arms control talks, there’s a very basic and simple principle, which is – for our friends and partners, which is nothing about you without you. So of course, European interests are implicated in any discussions we may have with Russia about strategic stability, and we will be in close coordination with France, with our partners if and as these talks move forward.</p>
<p>With regard to Afghanistan, a few things. I just want to reiterate an important point that sometimes gets lost, which is that even as we are withdrawing our forces from Afghanistan, we are not disengaging from Afghanistan; to the contrary. We’re working very hard to sustain a strong, diplomatic presence – not only our diplomatic presence, but with partners as well to sustain many of the programs that we’ve had in place to support Afghanistan economically: development assistance, humanitarian assistance, assistance to the Afghan security forces.</p>
<p>And President Ghani in Washington will be talking about all of that with President Biden, and I know the President will be reaffirming that ongoing support for Afghanistan, support that other countries will continue as well. At the same time, we’re watching the situation very, very closely, very carefully. We’re also working to make good on our obligations to those who helped us with the Special Immigrant Visa program, and I know the White House has discussed that in recent days.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LE DRIAN:</b> (Via interpreter) A few words on Russia given that you asked me about it. Two things, simply: First, we can only acknowledge the authoritarian trend in this country in various aspects, but in particular with something which is very much of a symbol, Mr. Navalny. We also see then there is a trend of intimidation by this country, and recently, we saw it in particular close to Ukraine. We can see also a trend of interference. So in each of these situations, we condemn, we adopt sanctions, and we stand extremely firm.</p>
<p>That being said, it is important to talk to Russia. Of course, it’s not about being naive about – talk to Russia. This is what President Macron did in August 2019 when he invited President Putin to come and talk. This is what President Biden just did because it is a great country. Because first it is our neighbor, and also because it is important that we have a stable relationship with this country, (inaudible). And it is in the name of these principles that we would like to maintain this dialogue. It does not prevent us from standing firm, like we said earlier.</p>
<p>But of course, Europe, as well, need to talk to Russia at a high level, and mainly because there is a major issue, which is arms control. And over the past few month, we witnessed the de-organization – deconstruction of the regulation system of weapons that – the system that was put in place in – at the end of the ’90s on the strategic armaments. And luckily, we have New START being extended, but we also have the issue of the intermediate nuclear forces. And all of these regulations are a matter of security to prevent any accident or incidence, to provide some relative transparency. All of that does not exist anymore, so this is what is at stake – the interest to rebuild, to begin to rebuild all of that. It was discussed by President Biden and President Putin, and this is what we will be working on together based on a common agenda.</p>
<p>So we need to talk to have a strategic stability, to have relational stability between the Europeans and the great neighbor. And all of the initiatives aiming at talking with a willingness of dialogue are there. And they’re not – the Americans, while they’re specialist in dialogue with Russia, and the Europeans are special experts in sanctions, we need both, and this is what we’re doing.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> And I’m sorry, I realized I didn’t get to the part of your question on Afghanistan. We are seeing elevated attacks on the Afghan security forces and in certain parts of the country compared to a year ago. No increase in attacks on our forces, on the NATO forces that remain. Had we not begun the process of drawing down our military forces, based on the agreement reached by the previous administration with the Taliban, our assessment is the status quo would not have held. The attacks that we’re seeing now and other attacks almost certainly would have commenced, including potentially attacks on provincial capitals.</p>
<p>So the status quo was not an option. But we’re looking very carefully at the situation on the ground in Afghanistan, and we’re also looking very hard at whether the Taliban is at all serious about a peaceful resolution to the conflict. We continue to be engaged on the diplomacy, but actions that would try to take the country by force are, of course, totally inconsistent with finding a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b> (Via interpreter) Question from Alexandra Brangeon, RFI.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) Mr. Minister, good morning, Secretary of State. You both mentioned the fight against terrorism in the Sahel. Since the inception of the G5 Sahel, France has been asking for this force to be under a mandate of the United Nations. Secretary of State, given the reduction of the staff or the transformation of Barkhane, is that a game-changer? Could it have an impact on the American policy? And like an American colleague of mine was asking, what’s the “can”?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> Well, I think I will – if it’s all right, I will – we’ll stick with English, but let me just say a few things here. As I said earlier, we are strong partners in the Sahel, and I actually had an opportunity very early on in my tenure as Secretary of State to take part in the G5 Sahel summit. That was back in February. We are continuing to strengthen our own approach to the region, but we have been the closest of partners together, and that partnership will continue. We very much understand the work that France is doing to recalibrate the approach, and I think we share the view that working to build the capacity of local partners to take on counterterrorism is the right approach. It makes a good deal of sense. But we’ll also very much continue to support the ongoing efforts that France is leading in the region.</p>
<p>As to structurally how this goes forward, that’s something that we’re talking about. But I can tell you that in terms of our support for the ongoing efforts in the Sahel that France will be making, that, that we’ll be making the other – that support will very much continue. We’ll continue to coordinate very closely, and to support one another in pursuit of our shared regional interests.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b> Our final question, we’ll go to Karen DeYoung of <i>The Washington Post</i>.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LE DRIAN:</b> (Via interpreter) If I may, a few words on this topic, which I know somehow. First of all, I can only rejoice about the fact that our decisions are properly understood, and – about the American willingness to continue to cooperate with us in the Sahel. The good understanding of our decision means that we continue to consider counterterrorism as a priority, in particular in the Sahel. So this fight will continue, but in a different military format. And it is not the first time we’ll adapt to the new deal of the threat.</p>
<p>And like I was telling Tony Blinken earlier, when I was at the time minister of defense, when we launched the Serval Operation in the Sahel and then we launched the Barkhane operation, and now we’re launching a new operation. It doesn’t have a name yet, but it is about adapting to the situation, it is about having a new model, probably with a less of a presence, of a footprint, but a stronger determination to cooperate with greater Sahel involvement, more of an international element, and more involvement of the special forces specialized in counter operations – counterterrorism in particular with – thanks to the Europeans and in particular in the Takuba Operation. France will remain the key element in it. We will have other opportunities to talk about this in Rome early next week.</p>
<p>I believe there was one last question. We agreed to take four questions, and then we’ll have to get &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. I’d like to ask a question about the Iran talks to both of you. Actually, it’s a question that has three parts. The State Department said yesterday that the talks cannot go on indefinitely and that at some point, if an agreement is not reached, the United States and its partners would have to regroup. Is there a point at which Iran’s qualitative gains in advancing its nuclear program would go too far and it becomes impossible to return to the JCPOA as written?</p>
<p>Also, there’s been no announcement as of yet of an agreement between Iran and the IAEA to extend the temporary monitoring agreement that expired yesterday, and I wonder how much of a concern that is to you.</p>
<p>And finally Iranian President-elect Raisi has been accused by numerous human rights groups of serious rights abuses dating back to the 1980s. Can the United States in all consciousness – conscientiousness, lift its sanctions against him without a proper international probe into those allegations? Thank you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> Thank you, Karen. A few things here. We still have serious differences with Iran with regard to returning to mutual compliance with the JCPOA. Our teams are going back for a seventh round of indirect negotiations in the coming days. We’ll see if we can bridge the differences, but they’re real, and we have to – we have to be able to bridge them. I would tell you that with regard to the IAEA this remains a serious concern, a concern that we’ve communicated to Iran, and it needs to be – needs to be resolved.</p>
<p>At some point – you’re right – if Iran continues to spin ever more sophisticated centrifuges at higher degrees, if it pursues other aspects of its program that were prohibited by the JCPOA, there will come a point, yes, where it will be very hard to return back to the standards set by the JCPOA of ensuring extensive breakout – breakout time – that is, the amount of time it would take Iran produce fissile materials for a nuclear weapon if it makes that decision, which I think adds some urgency to this effort. But we haven’t reached that point. I can’t put a date on it, but it’s something that we are conscious of. Having said that, we are only going to reach an agreement with Iran if it makes good on its obligations under the JCPOA. And again, we’re just not there yet, so we’ll see.</p>
<p>In terms of the last question, look, this is about pursuing our fundamental interests. And an Iran with a nuclear weapon or with a capacity to produce one on very short order is an Iran that is even more dangerous than it already is – an Iran can act with even greater impunity when it comes to supporting terrorism, destabilizing the region, engaging in proliferation. So we have a national interest in trying to put the nuclear problem back in the box that it was in under the JCPOA that unfortunately it is now out of. And at the same time in doing that, we will retain all of the necessary tools to deal with Iran’s actions in other areas that are profoundly dangerous and destabilizing.</p>
<p>In fact, I think we’ll be in a better position to do that, particularly since we’ll be united with our allies and partners on this. So our focus – irrespective of individuals, irrespective of leaders – is in pursuing the national interest, and we believe that if we can get back to compliance with the JCPOA, an agreement that was working that had put the nuclear program in a box, it would be in the national interest.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LE DRIAN:</b> (Inaudible) have to add to the Iranian issue further to what Tony just said. Except maybe, but he knows that well that the United Kingdom, France, and Germany held on good for the sake of our house for a number of years, which means that today we can revive the JCPOA. Without the determined vigilance on our part to keep the Vienna Accord alive, today we would not be renegotiating. And I must say that the coordination between the teams of the three European states and with the negotiators of the United States, all of that is happening and going well.</p>
<p>It’s been six weeks since the negotiations started again. Some progress was achieved, and we will now be entering the most difficult times. It will require some strong and courageous decisions on behalf of the new Iranian authorities, but now is the time. We are at the end of the process in the hard time, but there is some spirit, a mindset which I hope will remain and will enable an agreement, because, of course, it would be pointless to continue for too long. At some point in time, we’ll have to be back to the JCPOA, the 2015 accord.</p>
<p>It’s important even though we are not there yet, even though there were some major gestures, including on behalf of the United States of America. But then that will not be the end of it, like Tony was saying, because beyond the JCPOA there will be the issue of the sustainability of preserving the military nuclear element beyond the dates of the JCPOA.</p>
<p>We will also have to include in the regional dimension – make sure there is a forum in order to stabilize the region. And we will also need to take onboard the old issue of arms transfers, of the missiles coming from Iran. And we will have to articulate so the end of – we will have to articulate the JCPOA with all of these issues, and we are being optimistic – moderately optimistic, but nonetheless optimistic. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b> It is the end of it. I’m sorry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian</p>
<p>Paris, France</p>
<p>Quai d’Orsay</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LE DRIAN:</b> (Via interpreter) (In progress) Welcome back. It is excellent news for all of us that America is back. It has come back to the values that we share, come back to an imperative that we share, democracy. It has come back to multilateralism that we built together, and it is our responsibility to continue with it intensively.</p>
<p>These values, universal values, these democratic (inaudible) demand and this joint horizon, such are the foundations of what we share. And this is what France and the Europeans had to fight for alone far too often for four very long years against these attacks that continue. I’m very pleased that we are back together and we – that we can work together in order to preserve this international order based on cooperation and the law.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, together with Antony Blinken, we’ve been working in order to sustain this momentum by renewing a constant and confident – constant and confident dialogue which is indispensable for both our countries. Indispensable because the challenges that we face need all of our determination and all of our energy when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate emergency, the fight against the global inequalities. And the time as well, it is indispensable because we are, at the moment, witnessing an international life which is becoming more and more brittle. It is therefore a strategic imperative that we strengthen our alliance and meet at a bilateral level or within the relationship between the EU and the United States or within the balanced nature.</p>
<p>Like President Biden and yourself, you commended the efforts made by the Europeans within NATO to play their role. We all acknowledge that we are stronger together, stronger when it comes to fighting terrorism. And as you know, in the Sahel in particular and in the Levant and in the Sahel, we are undergoing a deep transformation of the French (inaudible) that is underway, and we’re very – like I told the Secretary of State, we very much wish the United States to continue to provide their support to the initiative.</p>
<p>We’re stronger as well when it comes to dealing with global crisis when that threatens our security interests. We were in Berlin two days ago, and we want to make sure that when it comes to Libya, we can obtain together the removal of the foreign forces, mercenaries, in compliance with the timeline for the political transition and in view of the elections on the 24th of December.</p>
<p>Stronger regarding Libya, but also on the Iranian matter, we are expecting the Iranian authorities to take the last decisions, probably difficult ones that will enable us to quickly come back to the full implementation of the Vienna accord.</p>
<p>It is true as well when it comes to the crisis in Lebanon, dear Tony, and I am pleased that this morning we noted not only that we share the same views, the same analysis of the situation: the terrible collapse of this country, the inability of the political leaders of this country to meet any aspect of the challenge. And we both also acknowledge that it would be such a tragedy if this country was to fall apart, would disappear. We noted all of that and we, ladies and gentlemen, decided to act together – to act together in order to exert pressure on those (inaudible). We know who they are, and it is not – the solution is not about immobility. So we agreed to take together some strong initiatives in order to unlock the situation. It is a matter of respect for the Lebanese people (inaudible) in order to preserve the stability of the Euro-Atlantic region, and some major decisions were taken on the occasion of the recent NATO summit. So we will be able to implement – to continue the strategic reflection initiated in 2019.</p>
<p>We will continue to feed the dialogue with Russia, particularly on arms control, and we share to that effect the same stance and approach of firmness made within NATO or within the European Union in order to continue our joint action.</p>
<p>We also talked about Armenia and Azerbaijan. We will continue to exchange on this matter and to coordinate our actions.</p>
<p>Being stronger, it’s also about being stronger in the Indo-Pacific region, which must absolutely remain a free and open space, and that requires a balanced approach vis-a-vis China. Of course, we discussed this matter as well in order to try and define this balance, and we agree on the necessity of our cooperation to adopt a lucid and pragmatic approach to what China means to us. That is, China is both a partner, a competitor, and a rival.</p>
<p>In addition, dear Tony, the relationship between France and the United States is a historic friendship, and we both, you and I, share some special responsibility. It is about respecting this background, but also keeping it alive.</p>
<p>And so to conclude, I have the pleasure of mentioning a beautiful project which (inaudible) couple of days, a network of (inaudible) on the American factory (inaudible) Albertine (inaudible) Villa Kujoyama in Kyoto. We will now have a Villa Albertine in the United States, but with a very new concept, (inaudible) to conclude my words to the press on this.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is a summary of our discussion this morning. We will continue our discussions in July on the occasion of my visit to the United States in mid-July, and we will have an opportunity to see each other again and to continue these very friendly and dense discussions on that occasion.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> (Via interpreter) Dear Jean-Yves, thank you for welcoming me so warmly. On a personal note, I would like to say how delighted I am to be here in France. It’s my second homeland, and I lived here for 10 years – over 10 years.</p>
<p>(In English) I’m also delighted that we were able to reunite so soon after the G7 at the NATO summit, the U.S.-EU Leaders Meeting. I think it’s a signal of how important, how foundational the friendship between France and the United States is to both our countries – our oldest ally and an alliance that we are now revitalizing even more for the challenges that we have to face, as you said, together.</p>
<p>As a kid in Paris, I learned how the values that the American people cherish are also cherished by the French. We throw these words around, but we actually give them meaning. France gives them meaning; the United States gives them meaning, at least on our best days – liberty, freedom of speech and thought, equality, every person’s right to be treated fairly and with dignity. I experienced how our cultures are so profoundly entwined, how French kids, at least when I was here, listened to American music. American kids watched French movies – actually now, French TV.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) The Bureau, Call My Agent, and Lupin.</p>
<p>(In English) If I have circles under my eyes, it’s because I stay up too late at night binge-watching these programs. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>And of course, I learned at a young age how much history our countries share, going back to the very start of the United States when France stood with us in our fight for freedom. Our partnership has been indispensable over so many years in meeting the challenges of the past. But it is, I think, even more indispensable now as we meet the challenges before us and that are having a real impact on the lives of our citizens, like stopping COVID-19, rising to the challenge of climate change, maintaining our joint security, defending our democratic values. As President Biden said again at the EU last week, the best way for our countries to deal with these challenges is by working together.</p>
<p>That includes through multilateralism. I’m visiting France, Germany, and Italy on this trip because, in addition to being our closest and strongest partners, these are also the only three countries that are members of the EU, NATO, and the G7. In the lead-up to the three summits and then at the summits themselves, our countries did important work together. And now we need to follow up on the steps we took – that’s exactly what we were doing this morning with the foreign minister and what I look forward to doing with President Macron later this afternoon – and also lay the groundwork for future collaborations. That includes our work at NATO to ensure the Alliance has the capabilities it needs to meet new threats, our agreement at the U.S.-EU summit to cooperate on setting the highest standards for trade and technology, and our work through the G7 to provide a billion vaccines to the world, to end support for coal-fired power plants, to move ahead on much-needed infrastructure development and projects in developing countries through the Build Back Better World initiative.</p>
<p>We very much look forward to working closely with our French counterparts and with France when France becomes president of the Council of the European Union in January. Jean-Yves, I think that’s an important moment for continuing to raise the level of ambition in the U.S.-EU relationship, and I think you agree with that proposition.</p>
<p>And as the foreign minister said, we are key partners together in dealing with regional and global security challenges. Together we’re going to support a sovereign, stable, unified, secure Libya, as we discussed together in Berlin just a couple of days ago. And we’ll see each other again in Rome in a couple of days to strengthen the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh and to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria, particularly through cross-border assistance.</p>
<p>We greatly value France’s leadership to counterterrorism in the Sahel region. We will continue to stand together in the Sahel. And with France, we’ll help our African partners work to address the drivers of economic, political, and social instability and bring security, stability, and good governance to their people.</p>
<p>We’re also working together to address the horrific violence and humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia and the governance and economic crisis in Lebanon, as Jean-Yves discussed. For over a year and a half, the Lebanese people have demanded transparency, accountability, and an end to the endemic corruption and mismanagement that is causing such hardship. The United States, France, the international community stand ready to help Lebanon – a Lebanon that is committed to meaningful change, but we need to see real leadership in Beirut.</p>
<p>And of course, we’re pursuing a shared approach to dealing with the challenges posed by China and Russia to the free and open rules-based international order.</p>
<p>Let me just briefly as well mention that, of course, we are very, very important economic partners. We’ll keep growing our trade and investment relationship. The United States is the largest foreign investor in France. We’re the top destination for French investment. Hundreds of thousands of Americans work for French companies, and vice versa. Deepening our economic ties will be critical not only for our economic recovery but also to our future competitiveness. And we’ll keep sustaining our people-to-people exchanges, and I am very enthusiastic about the initiative that Jean-Yves is launching. Thousands of American students come to France every year to study and discover for themselves how welcoming and, indeed, life-changing this country is, as I experienced myself. And we will continue to stand for our shared values of human rights and democracy around the world.</p>
<p>Democracies are facing new threats, also new opportunities. We have to bring together new ideas to the table to help democracies become more resilient, more effective at promoting representative, equitable societies. Together, we must and we will demonstrate that democracies can deliver for their citizens and for people around the world. I think that’s the challenge of our time. We have no better partner than France in pursuing it. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LE DRIAN:</b> (Via interpreter) Are you the moderator?</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b> (Via interpreter) Yes. First question, Virginie Robert from Les Echos on the French side.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) Good morning, Mr. Minister. You talked about the importance of the economic ties between France and the United States, which are very much troubled today by the impossibility of traveling to the United States. Could you please tell us when that will be possible again?</p>
<p>And Minister Le Drian, you talked about a more balanced relationship within NATO. Nonetheless, there are some stronger disagreements as to this organization. How – and China – how can you deal with that?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> With regard to travel, look, we are anxious to be able to restore travel as fully and as quickly as possible. We’re very much guided by the science, by our medical experts. That has to be the foundational principle on which we’re looking at this. We have a working group established with the European Union on this question, and all I can tell you – I can’t put a date on it. I can tell you we’re working very actively on this right now, and we are – like France, like our other partners in Europe – both anxious and looking forward to restoring travel. But we have to be guided by the science. We have to be guided by medical expertise.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LE DRIAN:</b> (Via interpreter) What was the question? (Inaudible) “Chinese-ation” of NATO? I was not aware of your concept because I can’t see the connection between the Atlantic Ocean and China. Is there a border? It is something very new today.</p>
<p>There were no disagreement between us as to the future of NATO, quite to the contrary, and I believe that this summit gives some – is a new start for NATO. It clearly identifies its purpose, putting back at the forefront our community of values, which are very much at the heart or the foundation of our Alliance, and saying as well – and that when we have a community of values, if there are some disagreements within the Alliance, they are to be dealt with based on the concept we agree upon. These values – you see who I am referring to – and we also agreed, as President Biden has said very strongly, that the European Union was a central element in the new relationship that we want to put in place within the Alliance when it comes to giving some new momentum to the Alliance. And we also agreed regarding the relationship with Russia.</p>
<p>As to China, I believe as well that things are clear between us. That was not the issue. Like I said earlier, we have a very close analysis with the three pillars I mentioned. We have both partners. China has partners, and we have to be partners when it comes to a number of issues, which are relevant to the entire planet. Given the importance of this country that – on climate, biodiversity, health, we are partners, but we’re also competitors because (inaudible) to a number of major economic, technological issues or innovation. We are competitors, so we had to make sure that we – our own interests are being respected and make sure that the same standards are applied on both sides so that it is fair.</p>
<p>And then we are rivals because on a number of topics, we (inaudible) to different models, ours and theirs. And in this respect, we stand very firm as to our demands, and I have in mind in particular the situation in the Xinjiang. This is it. So the three pillars will have to be combined depending on the particular point in time. The emergency or the focus might be more on one or another at different point in times, but we agreed to strike the right balance and – given that we share the same views on China. This is what I can tell you about China and NATO.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> Let me just add if I can, I think I wouldn’t have changed a word of what Jean-Yves just said. I think what we have seen, especially over the last few weeks, both at the G7, at NATO, and at the EU is a convergence of views on how to deal together with the challenges posed by China. And to the foreign minister’s point, we see it the same way. It’s, for all of us, a complicated relationship that has adversarial aspects, competitive ones, and cooperative ones. But the common denominator is that we’re going to be much more effective in engaging across these different aspects of the relationship if we do it together, and that’s what I think you saw come out of the three summits that we had, as well as the meeting between President Macron and President Biden.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b> Our first question goes to Shaun Tandon of the AFP.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you very much. Mr. Secretary, if I may begin, Afghanistan. President Ghani is in the United States today. There is an intelligence report warning that Kabul could fall as soon as six months after the U.S. withdrawal. How concerned are you about this? Is this motivating you to expedite contingency plans, particularly to protect the embassy and other U.S. interests?</p>
<p>If I may, can I ask both of you about Russia?</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) Mr. Minister, what is your message to European countries that are responding to the issue of a meeting with President Putin?</p>
<p>(In English.) And on the same question on Russia, President Macron has talked about having a seat at the table in arms talks with – to the United States and Russia. Does the United States support that? And would you support France and Germany moving along with Putin? Thanks.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> I’m happy to start. Let me just quickly start with the last question you asked. When it comes to strategic stability talks, arms control talks, there’s a very basic and simple principle, which is – for our friends and partners, which is nothing about you without you. So of course, European interests are implicated in any discussions we may have with Russia about strategic stability, and we will be in close coordination with France, with our partners if and as these talks move forward.</p>
<p>With regard to Afghanistan, a few things. I just want to reiterate an important point that sometimes gets lost, which is that even as we are withdrawing our forces from Afghanistan, we are not disengaging from Afghanistan; to the contrary. We’re working very hard to sustain a strong, diplomatic presence – not only our diplomatic presence, but with partners as well to sustain many of the programs that we’ve had in place to support Afghanistan economically: development assistance, humanitarian assistance, assistance to the Afghan security forces.</p>
<p>And President Ghani in Washington will be talking about all of that with President Biden, and I know the President will be reaffirming that ongoing support for Afghanistan, support that other countries will continue as well. At the same time, we’re watching the situation very, very closely, very carefully. We’re also working to make good on our obligations to those who helped us with the Special Immigrant Visa program, and I know the White House has discussed that in recent days.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LE DRIAN:</b> (Via interpreter) A few words on Russia given that you asked me about it. Two things, simply: First, we can only acknowledge the authoritarian trend in this country in various aspects, but in particular with something which is very much of a symbol, Mr. Navalny. We also see then there is a trend of intimidation by this country, and recently, we saw it in particular close to Ukraine. We can see also a trend of interference. So in each of these situations, we condemn, we adopt sanctions, and we stand extremely firm.</p>
<p>That being said, it is important to talk to Russia. Of course, it’s not about being naive about – talk to Russia. This is what President Macron did in August 2019 when he invited President Putin to come and talk. This is what President Biden just did because it is a great country. Because first it is our neighbor, and also because it is important that we have a stable relationship with this country, (inaudible). And it is in the name of these principles that we would like to maintain this dialogue. It does not prevent us from standing firm, like we said earlier.</p>
<p>But of course, Europe, as well, need to talk to Russia at a high level, and mainly because there is a major issue, which is arms control. And over the past few month, we witnessed the de-organization – deconstruction of the regulation system of weapons that – the system that was put in place in – at the end of the ’90s on the strategic armaments. And luckily, we have New START being extended, but we also have the issue of the intermediate nuclear forces. And all of these regulations are a matter of security to prevent any accident or incidence, to provide some relative transparency. All of that does not exist anymore, so this is what is at stake – the interest to rebuild, to begin to rebuild all of that. It was discussed by President Biden and President Putin, and this is what we will be working on together based on a common agenda.</p>
<p>So we need to talk to have a strategic stability, to have relational stability between the Europeans and the great neighbor. And all of the initiatives aiming at talking with a willingness of dialogue are there. And they’re not – the Americans, while they’re specialist in dialogue with Russia, and the Europeans are special experts in sanctions, we need both, and this is what we’re doing.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> And I’m sorry, I realized I didn’t get to the part of your question on Afghanistan. We are seeing elevated attacks on the Afghan security forces and in certain parts of the country compared to a year ago. No increase in attacks on our forces, on the NATO forces that remain. Had we not begun the process of drawing down our military forces, based on the agreement reached by the previous administration with the Taliban, our assessment is the status quo would not have held. The attacks that we’re seeing now and other attacks almost certainly would have commenced, including potentially attacks on provincial capitals.</p>
<p>So the status quo was not an option. But we’re looking very carefully at the situation on the ground in Afghanistan, and we’re also looking very hard at whether the Taliban is at all serious about a peaceful resolution to the conflict. We continue to be engaged on the diplomacy, but actions that would try to take the country by force are, of course, totally inconsistent with finding a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b> (Via interpreter) Question from Alexandra Brangeon, RFI.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> (Via interpreter) Mr. Minister, good morning, Secretary of State. You both mentioned the fight against terrorism in the Sahel. Since the inception of the G5 Sahel, France has been asking for this force to be under a mandate of the United Nations. Secretary of State, given the reduction of the staff or the transformation of Barkhane, is that a game-changer? Could it have an impact on the American policy? And like an American colleague of mine was asking, what’s the “can”?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> Well, I think I will – if it’s all right, I will – we’ll stick with English, but let me just say a few things here. As I said earlier, we are strong partners in the Sahel, and I actually had an opportunity very early on in my tenure as Secretary of State to take part in the G5 Sahel summit. That was back in February. We are continuing to strengthen our own approach to the region, but we have been the closest of partners together, and that partnership will continue. We very much understand the work that France is doing to recalibrate the approach, and I think we share the view that working to build the capacity of local partners to take on counterterrorism is the right approach. It makes a good deal of sense. But we’ll also very much continue to support the ongoing efforts that France is leading in the region.</p>
<p>As to structurally how this goes forward, that’s something that we’re talking about. But I can tell you that in terms of our support for the ongoing efforts in the Sahel that France will be making, that, that we’ll be making the other – that support will very much continue. We’ll continue to coordinate very closely, and to support one another in pursuit of our shared regional interests.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b> Our final question, we’ll go to Karen DeYoung of <i>The Washington Post</i>.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LE DRIAN:</b> (Via interpreter) If I may, a few words on this topic, which I know somehow. First of all, I can only rejoice about the fact that our decisions are properly understood, and – about the American willingness to continue to cooperate with us in the Sahel. The good understanding of our decision means that we continue to consider counterterrorism as a priority, in particular in the Sahel. So this fight will continue, but in a different military format. And it is not the first time we’ll adapt to the new deal of the threat.</p>
<p>And like I was telling Tony Blinken earlier, when I was at the time minister of defense, when we launched the Serval Operation in the Sahel and then we launched the Barkhane operation, and now we’re launching a new operation. It doesn’t have a name yet, but it is about adapting to the situation, it is about having a new model, probably with a less of a presence, of a footprint, but a stronger determination to cooperate with greater Sahel involvement, more of an international element, and more involvement of the special forces specialized in counter operations – counterterrorism in particular with – thanks to the Europeans and in particular in the Takuba Operation. France will remain the key element in it. We will have other opportunities to talk about this in Rome early next week.</p>
<p>I believe there was one last question. We agreed to take four questions, and then we’ll have to get &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> Thank you. I’d like to ask a question about the Iran talks to both of you. Actually, it’s a question that has three parts. The State Department said yesterday that the talks cannot go on indefinitely and that at some point, if an agreement is not reached, the United States and its partners would have to regroup. Is there a point at which Iran’s qualitative gains in advancing its nuclear program would go too far and it becomes impossible to return to the JCPOA as written?</p>
<p>Also, there’s been no announcement as of yet of an agreement between Iran and the IAEA to extend the temporary monitoring agreement that expired yesterday, and I wonder how much of a concern that is to you.</p>
<p>And finally Iranian President-elect Raisi has been accused by numerous human rights groups of serious rights abuses dating back to the 1980s. Can the United States in all consciousness – conscientiousness, lift its sanctions against him without a proper international probe into those allegations? Thank you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b> Thank you, Karen. A few things here. We still have serious differences with Iran with regard to returning to mutual compliance with the JCPOA. Our teams are going back for a seventh round of indirect negotiations in the coming days. We’ll see if we can bridge the differences, but they’re real, and we have to – we have to be able to bridge them. I would tell you that with regard to the IAEA this remains a serious concern, a concern that we’ve communicated to Iran, and it needs to be – needs to be resolved.</p>
<p>At some point – you’re right – if Iran continues to spin ever more sophisticated centrifuges at higher degrees, if it pursues other aspects of its program that were prohibited by the JCPOA, there will come a point, yes, where it will be very hard to return back to the standards set by the JCPOA of ensuring extensive breakout – breakout time – that is, the amount of time it would take Iran produce fissile materials for a nuclear weapon if it makes that decision, which I think adds some urgency to this effort. But we haven’t reached that point. I can’t put a date on it, but it’s something that we are conscious of. Having said that, we are only going to reach an agreement with Iran if it makes good on its obligations under the JCPOA. And again, we’re just not there yet, so we’ll see.</p>
<p>In terms of the last question, look, this is about pursuing our fundamental interests. And an Iran with a nuclear weapon or with a capacity to produce one on very short order is an Iran that is even more dangerous than it already is – an Iran can act with even greater impunity when it comes to supporting terrorism, destabilizing the region, engaging in proliferation. So we have a national interest in trying to put the nuclear problem back in the box that it was in under the JCPOA that unfortunately it is now out of. And at the same time in doing that, we will retain all of the necessary tools to deal with Iran’s actions in other areas that are profoundly dangerous and destabilizing.</p>
<p>In fact, I think we’ll be in a better position to do that, particularly since we’ll be united with our allies and partners on this. So our focus – irrespective of individuals, irrespective of leaders – is in pursuing the national interest, and we believe that if we can get back to compliance with the JCPOA, an agreement that was working that had put the nuclear program in a box, it would be in the national interest.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LE DRIAN:</b> (Inaudible) have to add to the Iranian issue further to what Tony just said. Except maybe, but he knows that well that the United Kingdom, France, and Germany held on good for the sake of our house for a number of years, which means that today we can revive the JCPOA. Without the determined vigilance on our part to keep the Vienna Accord alive, today we would not be renegotiating. And I must say that the coordination between the teams of the three European states and with the negotiators of the United States, all of that is happening and going well.</p>
<p>It’s been six weeks since the negotiations started again. Some progress was achieved, and we will now be entering the most difficult times. It will require some strong and courageous decisions on behalf of the new Iranian authorities, but now is the time. We are at the end of the process in the hard time, but there is some spirit, a mindset which I hope will remain and will enable an agreement, because, of course, it would be pointless to continue for too long. At some point in time, we’ll have to be back to the JCPOA, the 2015 accord.</p>
<p>It’s important even though we are not there yet, even though there were some major gestures, including on behalf of the United States of America. But then that will not be the end of it, like Tony was saying, because beyond the JCPOA there will be the issue of the sustainability of preserving the military nuclear element beyond the dates of the JCPOA.</p>
<p>We will also have to include in the regional dimension – make sure there is a forum in order to stabilize the region. And we will also need to take onboard the old issue of arms transfers, of the missiles coming from Iran. And we will have to articulate so the end of – we will have to articulate the JCPOA with all of these issues, and we are being optimistic – moderately optimistic, but nonetheless optimistic. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b> It is the end of it. I’m sorry.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>On June 25, 2021, the United States Department of State released the 2021 Fiscal Transparency Report, which found that 74 of the 141 governments reviewed by the Department met minimum requirements of fiscal transparency.  Seventeen of the 67 governments that did not meet minimum requirements made significant progress during the review period.</p>
<p>Fiscal transparency is a critical element of effective public financial management, helps build private market confidence, and underpins economic sustainability.  It fosters greater government accountability by providing a window into government budgets for citizens, helping citizens hold their leadership accountable, and facilitating better-informed public debate.  These Congressionally-mandated annual fiscal transparency reviews provide opportunities to engage in dialogue with governments on the importance of fiscal transparency, particularly important given the need for significant economic, health, and social spending to offset the shocks of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The report describes the minimum requirements of fiscal transparency, reviews 141 governments, most of which were identified as recipients of U.S. assistance in the 2014 Fiscal Transparency Report, and further assesses governments that did not meet the minimum fiscal transparency requirements during the review period of January 1 – December 31, 2020.  The report also indicates whether governments that did not meet those requirements made significant progress to publicly disclose national budget documentation, contracts, and licenses during the review period.  The Department of State evaluated the public availability, substantial completeness, and reliability of budget documents, as well as the transparency of processes for awarding government contracts and licenses.  Beginning with this review period, if a government has a sovereign wealth fund, it must disclose its source of funding and general approach to withdrawals from the fund.  Additionally, debt of all major state-owned enterprises must now be disclosed, and the government must have a supreme audit institution that meets international standards of independence and has verified the government’s annual financial statements.</p>
<p>The report can be found on the Department’s website at <a href="https://www.state.gov/fiscal-transparency-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTA2MjUuNDI0MTEwNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZS5nb3YvZmlzY2FsLXRyYW5zcGFyZW5jeS1yZXBvcnQifQ.WK5ImjVnKy50J-ygHuQUAyr0k6OkiiPwhFiB1hee-2Q/s/1039202793/br/108439705831-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624719354905000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFfkAcLw6QqnBCf_KUiSrR7jjjLiw">https://www.state.gov/fiscal-<wbr />transparency-report</a>.  For further information, please contact the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs’ Fiscal Transparency team at <a href="mailto:fiscaltransparency@state.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiscaltransparency@state.gov</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Democracy flourishes when institutions of governance are inclusive, transparent, accountable, and responsive to its people. With that immutable fact in mind, the United States commends those Ethiopians who exercised their right to vote on June 21.</p>
<p>Elections, however, are not in and of themselves a sufficient marker of democracy or genuine political reform. The June 21 elections in Ethiopia took place against a backdrop of grave instability, including increasing inter-ethnic and inter-communal conflicts, and an electoral process that was not free or fair for all Ethiopians. The boycott of the elections by opposition parties, the detention of vocal political leaders, and the ongoing violence in multiple parts of the country underscore the need to launch an inclusive effort to build a national consensus on the governance of Ethiopia that preserves the sovereignty and unity of the state and strengthens the constitutional order.</p>
<p>In this period following the election, it is critical that Ethiopians come together to confront growing divisions. We urge politicians and community leaders to reject violence and refrain from inciting others to violence. The United States stands ready to assist Ethiopians to advance post-election dialogue, resolution of conflicts, and national reconciliation in Ethiopia. The ongoing conflict, violence, and likely famine declaration in Tigray demand urgent action, including a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Eritrean forces from Ethiopian territory, the transparent investigation of atrocities, and unhindered humanitarian access to populations in need.</p>
<p>We look forward to a continued partnership with the Ethiopian people and to supporting efforts to promote inclusive political participation that moves the country forward on a path to democracy and national unity.</p>
