					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today, the United States and the Philippines signed a Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Strategic Civil Nuclear Cooperation (NCMOU), which improves our cooperation on energy security and strengthens our diplomatic and economic relationship. Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie Jenkins signed for the United States, and Mr. Gerardo Erguiza Jr., Undersecretary of Energy, signed for the Philippines.</p>
<p>The United States and the Philippines have an enduring alliance and maintain long-standing cooperation in the fields of security, energy, commerce, and nonproliferation.  Deepening our cooperation in nuclear energy, science and technology has the potential to make a significant contribution to our shared clean energy goals, agricultural development, availability of clean water, medical treatments, and more.  Our nuclear cooperation rests on a strong nonproliferation regime and the Philippines’ steadfast commitment to nonproliferation.</p>
<p>Nuclear Cooperation MOUs are diplomatic mechanisms that strengthen and expand strategic ties between the United States and a partner country by providing a framework for cooperation and a mutually aligned approach to nonproliferation on civil nuclear issues and for engagement between experts from government, industry, national laboratories, and academic institutions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Wendy R. Sherman, Deputy Secretary of State</p>
<p>Algiers, Algeria</p>
<p>Good afternoon. It is wonderful to back in Algiers for my first visit as Deputy Secretary of State. And I’m so delighted to be standing here with your Foreign Minister  and our Ambassador .</p>
<p>I want to sincerely thank President Tebboune for his hospitality and warm welcome. We just concluded a very productive meeting.</p>
<p>The President shared with me his plans to create more jobs and diversify Algeria’s economy into strategic sectors, including agribusiness, information communications technology, and clean energy.</p>
<p>These are areas where U.S. businesses can work closely with Algeria. For instance, just last week a delegation of U.S. small businesses in wind energy, wastewater treatment, and oil services visited Algeria.</p>
<p>The United States and Algeria both want to increase trade and economic cooperation with each other. We are thrilled and honored that the President plans to visit the U.S. pavilion during the Algiers International Fair this June, where the United States will be the country of honor.</p>
<p>We also discussed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s—in my words—premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war of choice against Ukraine, and how President Putin’s actions violate the principles of the UN Charter.</p>
<p>Our meeting also covered some important regional issues, and I look forward to continuing the discussion I also had with the Foreign Minister earlier today.</p>
<p>The United States and Algeria agree that regional stability is key to a peaceful and prosperous future for the entire Sahel.  Both of our countries are concerned about the destabilizing presence of foreign forces and are working together to counter violent extremist groups.</p>
<p>I also reaffirmed the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to human rights, including media freedom and religious freedom.</p>
<p>The United States’ relationship with Algeria is broad and deep, and we look forward to continuing to further deepen our cooperation on jobs and economic development, clean energy, security, and other areas.</p>
<p>Once again, I was honored by my time with your President, and for his gracious—and for the Foreign Minister’s gracious—hospitality today. We are thrilled that we have sent you one of our very best to be Ambassador here, and I know she will carry on the conversations we started today to further deepen our relationship.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.<input type="hidden" data-filter="111111110011" /></p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony J.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>On December 9-10, 2021, President Biden hosted the first of two Summits for Democracy, a global gathering of 100 government leaders, hundreds of members of civil society, and the business community, to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing democracies in the 21st century.  At the Summit, the U.S. Government announced that the time between leaders’ gatherings would constitute a Year of Action, during which the United States would work with partners to advance the commitments they made to one another to strengthen democracy, promote respect for human rights, and counter corruption and authoritarianism.</p>
<p>As Russia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion of its democratic neighbor Ukraine illustrates, defending democracy, contesting authoritarianism, and standing up for the human rights of all have never been more important to international peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Throughout the Year of Action, the U.S. Government will therefore encourage structured dialogue and action among governments and other stakeholders to advance commitments and initiatives announced by world leaders, and to report back on their progress at the second Summit.</p>
<p>To help facilitate progress and advance the Summit’s themes, the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other interagency partners will support a series of consultative processes that aim to:</p>
<ol>
<li>support governments in making verifiable progress on their commitments;</li>
<li>institutionalize Summit themes and commitments into existing platforms;</li>
<li>craft a Summit outcome document; and</li>
<li>develop an inclusive agenda for the second Summit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Across these efforts, the Department of State and USAID will engage with U.S. government interagency partners at the Departments of Labor, Treasury, Justice, and Commerce, as well as other relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>To achieve its objectives, the U.S. Government will:</p>

<li><i>Establish a Platform for Governments and Authorities to Advance Summit Goals</i>: We will create a Focal Group as an opportunity to engage collaboratively with our Summit government and official partners in the lead-up to the second Summit.  The U.S. government will coordinate the group and chair meetings; other focal points will be invited to participate in meetings and may lead working groups on specific aspects of planning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i></i><i>Build Multistakeholder Processes for Collaboration on Summit Goals</i>:  We will launch multistakeholder platforms, called Democracy Cohorts, to take concerted action toward commitment implementation in areas of common interest.  Each Democracy Cohort will bring together governments that demonstrate political will toward progress on Summit commitments in a specific issue area with key nongovernmental stakeholders invested in the outcome. The process will provide opportunities for meaningful dialogue and collaboration among civil society representatives, private <wbr />sector leaders, philanthropic partners, and government decision-makers on issues vital to good governance and democratic renewal.  The U.S. Government will co-lead a limited number of cohorts and will welcome other governments and civil society groups volunteering to spearhead additional cohorts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Engage Diverse and Expansive Nongovernmental Stakeholders</i>:  The U.S. Government will continue to hold informal, recurring consultations with a broad swath of nongovernmental organizations, philanthropies, and the private sector to discuss fulfillment of our Summit One commitments, as well as Year of Action and Summit Two plans. Other governments are strongly encouraged to hold their own, regular consultations with nongovernmental stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Tell the Story of Democracies Delivering</i>:<i> </i>The U.S. Government will spotlight and support examples of democracies delivering for citizens through messaging and public diplomacy programs, as well as highlight progress that countries make on their Summit commitments.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>On December 9-10, 2021, President Biden hosted the first of two Summits for Democracy, a global gathering of 100 government leaders, hundreds of members of civil society, and the business community, to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing democracies in the 21st century.  At the Summit, the U.S. Government announced that the time between leaders’ gatherings would constitute a Year of Action, during which the United States would work with partners to advance the commitments they made to one another to strengthen democracy, promote respect for human rights, and counter corruption and authoritarianism.</p>
<p>As Russia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion of its democratic neighbor Ukraine illustrates, defending democracy, contesting authoritarianism, and standing up for the human rights of all have never been more important to international peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Throughout the Year of Action, the U.S. Government will therefore encourage structured dialogue and action among governments and other stakeholders to advance commitments and initiatives announced by world leaders, and to report back on their progress at the second Summit.</p>
<p>To help facilitate progress and advance the Summit’s themes, the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other interagency partners will support a series of consultative processes that aim to:</p>
<ol>
<li>support governments in making verifiable progress on their commitments;</li>
<li>institutionalize Summit themes and commitments into existing platforms;</li>
<li>craft a Summit outcome document; and</li>
<li>develop an inclusive agenda for the second Summit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Across these efforts, the Department of State and USAID will engage with U.S. government interagency partners at the Departments of Labor, Treasury, Justice, and Commerce, as well as other relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>To achieve its objectives, the U.S. Government will:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Establish a Platform for Governments and Authorities to Advance Summit Goals</i>: We will create a Focal Group as an opportunity to engage collaboratively with our Summit government and official partners in the lead-up to the second Summit.  The U.S. government will coordinate the group and chair meetings; other focal points will be invited to participate in meetings and may lead working groups on specific aspects of planning.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Kremlin is intentionally spreading outright lies that the United States and Ukraine are conducting chemical and biological weapons activities in Ukraine.  We have also seen PRC officials echo these conspiracy theories.  This Russian disinformation is total nonsense and not the first time Russia has invented such false claims against another country.  Also, these claims have been debunked conclusively and repeatedly over many years.</p>
<p>As we have said all along, Russia is inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine. The United States does not own or operate any chemical or biological laboratories in Ukraine, it is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention, and it does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere. It is Russia that has active chemical and biological weapons programs and is in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention.</p>
<p>Finally, Russia has a track record of accusing the West of the very crimes that Russia itself is perpetrating. These tactics are an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attacks on Ukraine. We fully expect Russia to continue to double down on these sorts of claims with further unfounded allegations.</p>
