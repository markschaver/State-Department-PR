					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p class="p1">Today marks 50 years since the Turkish Constitutional Court ruled that all institutions of higher education must either nationalize or close, resulting in the closure of the Theological School of Halki, a seminary of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the Eastern Orthodox Church.  The Halki Seminary had operated for 127 years, and its closing deprived the Ecumenical Patriarchate of a training school for Orthodox clergy in Turkey, its home for 1,690 years.  Since Halki’s closure, those wishing to become Orthodox clergy have been forced to go abroad for their training.</p>
<p class="p1">The United States continues to urge the Turkish government to respect the right to freedom of religion or belief as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and allow the reopening of the Halki Seminary.  Moreover, we call upon the government of Turkey to allow all religious groups to again train their clergy within the country.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New Delhi, India</p>
<p>The Leela Palace Hotel</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Welcome to <em>The</em> <em>Times of India</em>, and &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So let’s just start off right.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So what has – what have we achieved in the Quad so far?  And where do you think it’s (inaudible)?  You’ve got a summit coming up.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, first we had the first ever leaders-level meeting of the Quad.  That was in and of itself very significant, because it just underscored the importance that the four countries – India, the United States, Japan, and Australia – attach to the Quad.  And what we’ve achieved already is bringing together four likeminded democracies in common purpose to deal with some of the most important problems and challenges facing our countries, and in fact facing the region and even the world, starting with COVID-19, and a commitment to work together to finance, to produce, to distribute millions of vaccines.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Are you satisfied with the progress on the vaccine?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Yeah, I think we’re making – we’re making progress on that.  I think the – when the leaders get together next, they’ll be able to assess that progress.  Of course, COVID-19 remains a huge challenge for all of us, and since the first virtual leaders meeting, the second wave hit India.  I’m proud that the United States was able to come to India’s assistance, as India came to our assistance early during the pandemic when we had real challenges.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We’ve seen reports of a digital services tax that had been proposed by the U.S.  Is there something &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I’m sorry, digital services?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  A digital services agreement between countries – likeminded countries, I guess.  Is there something that you &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We’re – there – we’re doing work in a wide variety of areas, to include not just COVID-19, but working together on the climate crisis, working together on infrastructure, on maritime security, on – and on emerging technologies.  And that includes in the digital space.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And if you would tell us, for Indian readers, because we are – we know the China challenge.  We’ve shed blood.  What – how would you describe the challenge of China to the world, to West and India &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  For the United States, in a way as for India, it’s both one of the most consequential and most complicated relationships that we have.  I think we’ve seen China – unfortunately, the government in Beijing act more repressively at home and more aggressively abroad in recent years.  That poses a challenge for all of us.  As we look at it, we see a relationship that is in parts adversarial, in parts competitive, and also in parts cooperative.  And I think what we’ve found is that whether it’s adversarial, whether it’s competitive, whether it’s cooperative, the most effective way to engage China is working with other countries that are similarly situated and that face similar challenges.  India, of course, is a strong partner for the United States.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Do you think the era of cooperation with China may be over?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  No.  As I said, I think the relationship has different elements in it.  Cooperation remains one of them because on some issues, it’s profoundly in our mutual interest to cooperate, and irrespective of the competition, irrespective of the adversarial nature of parts of the relationship, that’s – those interests remain.  Climate may be the best example.  That’s an issue that is important to all of us.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  With the troops withdrawal – U.S. troops withdrawal from Afghanistan, I have two questions.  One is:  Do you think it affects the U.S. credibility as a partner?  Second, as a woman, I have to ask this:  For 20 years, women have had a good run in Afghanistan.  Do you think we’re sort of feeding them to the wolves, so to speak?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Two things.  As you just said, 20 years.  It’s been 20 years.  We have to remember why we went to Afghanistan in the first place.  It’s because we were attacked on 9/11.  We went to do justice for – to those who attacked us and to try to make sure that it couldn’t happen again.  And we’ve largely succeeded in that effort.  Usama bin Ladin was brought to justice 10 years ago.  And al-Qaida, the organization that attacked us, in terms of its capacity to do that again from Afghanistan, that’s been vastly diminished.</p>
<p>It’s now 20 years later, a trillion dollars later, more than 4,500 American soldiers lost their lives later.  Afghanistan ultimately has to be able to shape its own future, but with our support.  Even as we withdraw our forces, we are staying very much engaged in Afghanistan with a strong embassy, with programs to support women and girls, economic development, humanitarian assistance, and the security forces.  So we’re remaining very much engaged – also with our diplomacy, because the only resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan is at the negotiating table, not at the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Pakistan continues to support the Taliban.  And are we seeing the same effect in Afghanistan today that we saw for the last 20 years?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Pakistan has a vital role to play in using its influence with the Taliban to do whatever it can to make sure that the Taliban does not seek to take the country by force.  And it does have influence, and it does have a role to play, and we hope that it plays it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  What are your priority items with India?  And when do we expect a presidential visit to India?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, I can’t put a date on it, but I know that President Biden very much looks forward to visiting India, and similarly to having Prime Minister Modi in the United States.  But no date yet, but I’m sure that that will come.</p>
<p>Look, in terms of priorities, the relationship is both so wide and so deep there are – as we discussed today through several hours with Foreign Minister Jaishankar – a multiplicity of places where we’re working together.  But I would say, again, we’re obviously focused on COVID together.  We’re focused on climate together.  We’re focused on the role of emerging technologies together.  But we’re also focused on strengthening our trade and investment relationship, bringing our scientists and technologists and innovators together, strengthening people-to-people ties.  We look forward to welcoming nearly 70,000 Indian students to the United States for this next semester.</p>
<p>So it’s incredibly broad, and what we’ve seen over the last 20 years, 25 years through different administrations in both countries is a relationship that’s only gotten stronger and deeper.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Squeezing in one last &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Very short.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  The – India will probably take delivery of the S-400 from Russia later this year.  How will that impact, given what the Congress – CAATSA act?  What – how would that impact U.S.-India relations?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, we have – we have our laws.  We’ll – we apply our laws, but we shared our concerns with India about this.  But I’m not going to get ahead of myself.  We’ll see how things evolve in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you so much, Secretary.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>

<p>Protests in Iran that began with a water shortage &#8212; owing to drought and governmental mismanagement and neglect &#8212; in the Khuzestan province have now spread across various cities including Tehran, Karaj and Tabriz.  The Iranian people are now putting a spotlight not only on their unmet needs, but also their unfulfilled aspirations for respect for human rights &#8212; rights to which individuals the world over are entitled.</p>
<p>The Iranian people have a right to voice their frustrations and hold their government accountable, but we have seen disturbing reports that security forces fired on protesters, resulting in multiple deaths.  We condemn the use of violence against peaceful protestors.  We support the rights of Iranians to peacefully assemble and express themselves, without fear of violence and detention by security forces.  We are also monitoring reports of internet slowdowns in the region.</p>
<p>We urge the Iranian government to allow its citizens to exercise their right to freedom of expression and to freely access information, including via the Internet.</p>

<p>An independent and diverse judging committee selected the following five finalists for the 2021 Award based on the operational structure, measurable social impact, financial sustainability, innovation, and scalability of the partnerships:</p>
<p><b>100,000 Strong in the Americas Innovation Fund </b>– Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</p>
<p>The 100,000 Strong in the Americas (100K) Innovation Fund is an impactful and durable hemisphere-wide education initiative that catalyzes student development and mobility across the Americas, builds institutional capacity, and expands inter-regional partnerships.  The 100K Strong Innovation Fund is a public-private partnership created in 2013 by then White House National Security Council, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, Partners of the Americas, and NAFSA: Association of International Educators.  It was scaled by creating dynamic regional, resilient public-private partnerships across sectors to inspire new higher education partnerships and increase the number and diversity of students in the Americas who have access to innovative exchange and training opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Beyond Extraction: Economic Opportunities in Mining Communities –</b> Brazil, Chile &amp; Peru</p>
<p>TechnoServe, Anglo American, and the Inter-American Development Bank are collaborating in a regional, tripartite public-private partnership to catalyze locally adapted economic development for communities surrounding Anglo American’s mining operations in Brazil, Chile, and Peru.  Taking an ecosystems approach and leveraging opportunities in the mining value chain, Beyond Extraction has worked with national and local governments, the private sector, and civil society to support more inclusive and diversified local economies in these communities through enterprise, workforce, and value-chain development.</p>
<p><b>Cambodia Rural Sanitation Development Impact Bond –</b> Cambodia</p>
<p>In November 2019, the Stone Family Foundation, U.S. Agency for International Development, and iDE collaboratively launched the Cambodia Rural Sanitation Development Impact Bond (DIB) partnership.  The first of its kind in the water and sanitation sector, the DIB combines private and public capital with on-the-ground implementation expertise to help eradicate open defecation in Cambodia and accelerate the Royal Government of Cambodia’s efforts to reach universal sanitation. The DIB’s four-year objective is to help 1,600 villages across six provinces in Cambodia achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status, and aims to develop market-based solutions that will contribute to universal sanitation coverage in six provinces (Svay Rieng, Kandal, Prey Veng, Kampong Thom, Siem Reap and Oddar Meanchey)—reducing stunting among children and preventing the spread of disease and contamination of drinking water.</p>
<p><b>Salud Mesoamerica Initiative </b>– Central America and the State of Chiapas, Mexico</p>
<p>The Salud Mesoamerica Initiative is a public-private partnership between the Inter-American Development Bank, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Carlos Slim Foundation, the Governments of Canada and Spain, and seven Central American countries, and Mexico.  It was created in 2011 to reduce health inequities and to support participating countries in their pursuit of achieving the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals, with a focus on reaching 1.8 million women and children living among the poorest 20% of the population in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and the state of Chiapas, Mexico.</p>
<p><b>Standard Microgrid (SMG) and Zambian Rural Electrification Authority (REA) – </b>Zambia</p>
<p>Through collaborative partnership, Standard Microgrid and Zambian Rural Electrification Authority have launched a new business model in Zambia that is community-managed and considered an off-grid micro utility business which can be implemented in rural settings throughout Africa.  It entails individuals designing their own power subscriptions in accordance with the appliances they need, when they need them, and how much they are willing to pay.</p>
<p>The winner of the P3 Impact Award will be announced at the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.concordia.net/annualsummit/2021annualsummit/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">2021 Concordia Annual Summit</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>, taking place the week of September 20, 2021.  Stakeholders representing the finalists will showcase their partnership before judges and an in-person and digital audience.  Judges will evaluate each partnership based on the strength of cross-sector collaboration, measurable impact, economic and social benefits, innovation, financial effectiveness, and scalability.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New Delhi, India</p>
<p>The Leela Palace Hotel</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> All right. Joining us now, a very special guest, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Thank you very much for speaking with us here on CNN-News18. You’ve just come off a meeting with your counterpart, Foreign Minister Jaishankar. A large part of your conversation was around the Quad. Can you tell us what is the U.S.’s vision of the Quad? And you also said right after the meeting that you don’t see it as a military alliance. Can you elaborate on that?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> It’s not a military alliance. What it is, is a group of likeminded democracies – India, the United States, Japan, Australia – coming together to work cooperatively on issues and matters that are going to affect the lives of citizens in all of our countries, and indeed, in the Indo-Pacific as a whole. And beneath that is the conviction that the Indo-Pacific needs to remain a free and open region, but we’re working together on COVID-19 and making sure that we can provide more vaccines to the world, we’re working together on addressing climate change, and on issues as varied as maritime security to infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>So most of the challenges that we face in the world that affect the lives of our citizens can’t be resolved by any one country acting alone. And so it’s a natural and normal thing for likeminded democracies to come together and work on these things together.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So how do you respond to the Chinese criticism that the only purpose of the Quad is to target China or to contain China?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Well, I don’t think that being able to finance, produce, and distribute tens of millions, hundreds of millions of more vaccines is targeting China except in the most positive way. It’s trying to help the region and help the world get over COVID-19. And virtually all of the work that we’re doing together is to, in one way or another, improve the lives of people in the region and make sure that it remains free and open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> When you say it’s not a military alliance, it’s not traditionally like your NATO Allies or your other treaty allies whereby if, God forbid, one of the four were to be physically or in some form attacked, it doesn’t mean that the others are to rush in and protect it?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Let’s talk about vaccines. You did say that a large part of your conversation with your counterpart was on vaccines. The two American vaccines, Moderna and Pfizer, we’re given to understand, in principle, approvals have been given. What is your best understanding of why we haven’t gotten those jabs into Indian arms yet?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Well, first, it’s important for me to say that when we were suffering the most from COVID early on, India came to our assistance, and that’s something that we’ll never forget, providing ventilators when our hospitals were at risk of being overwhelmed. And in turn, when India had its second wave, we’ve tried to step up and be of assistance as friends do for one another. And I’m very proud of the fact that we’ve contributed over the course of COVID about a quarter of a billion dollars in assistance to India. Our private sector, individuals, have come together and provided hundreds of millions of dollars as well. And we’re seeing, I think, some results from that.</p>
<p>We have also made available several, millions of vaccines, and I think – my best understanding now, as, of course, with any country, there’s an approval process and a regulatory process and a legal process required for receiving vaccines, and that’s where things stand.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Let’s talk about Afghanistan. Again, a large part of your conversation was about Afghanistan. We’re approaching the 20th anniversary of 9/11 and the war in Afghanistan. The decision by President Biden to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and subsequently reports of the Taliban taking over large tracts of territory, do you think that decision was rushed?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Well, as you said, we’re approaching the 20th anniversary of 9/11, 20 years. And we have to remember why we went to Afghanistan in the first place. It’s because we were attacked on 9/11, and we went to deal with those who attacked us, and thankfully, in solidarity with many other countries. And we went to make sure that we would bring to justice those who attacked us and do our best to make sure that it couldn’t happen again, and we’ve largely achieved what we set out to achieve. Usama bin Ladin was brought to justice 10 years ago and al-Qaida, as a threat from Afghanistan to the United States or to anyone else, has been vastly diminished, if not entirely eliminated. So that purpose has largely been achieved.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But do you think &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> But at the same time, we spent 20 years, a trillion dollars, 4,500 Americans lost their lives. Afghanistan has to be in a position to decide its own future, decide it for itself, but with the support of the international community. Even as we’re withdrawing our forces, we’re remaining very much engaged in Afghanistan: supporting the government, economic assistance, development assistance, assistance for the security forces, and diplomacy to try to bring the parties together for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> There were pictures today, there was a high-level meeting in Beijing where Taliban representatives had met with the foreign minister there, and I’m wondering what you would want to say about China getting involved in this. Because the prevailing notion here seems to be as the U.S. withdraws, China steps into that vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Well, I think many countries in – immediately neighboring Afghanistan and in the broader region, including China, have interests in Afghanistan. And as it happens, those interests largely align. No one, whether it’s the United States, China, India, Pakistan, Iran, Russia, Central Asian countries – no one has an interest in Afghanistan falling into an enduring civil war. No one has an interest in a military takeover of the country by the Taliban, the restoration of an Islamic emirate. Everyone has an interest in a peaceful resolution of the conflict and some kind of government that emerges that’s truly representative and inclusive. And so if China is acting on those interests, if other countries are acting on those interests, that’s a positive thing.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You had mentioned in the press briefing as well that one of the areas that you talked about today was about strengthening democratic institutions. Can you point to particular areas of concern that you have vis-a-vis India and India’s democratic institutions – why did that come up in conversation?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Oh, I think we’re – we both have challenges in our own democracy, so we had an interesting exchange on that. One of the challenges, for example, is in the – in cyberspace, in the space of the internet, and the distinction between, for example, regulating misinformation in cyberspace versus political speech. And sometimes it’s a thin line that we have to look at carefully. We’re facing these challenges ourselves.</p>
<p>So it was an important opportunity to compare notes about that, about a number of other issues, but I think we – again, we come from the same place, societies that are animated by democratic ideals and very vibrant democracies, but that each have their challenges, and it’s good for us to be able to speak about these things openly and directly.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> All right. Finally, you’ll be meeting Prime Minister Modi. Will you be inviting him to visit the White House? Do we know if President Biden will be coming to India soon?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Well, I’m sure that there will be ample opportunity, and I know that President Biden would welcome it for the prime minister to visit, and equally for President Biden to come here. We haven’t fixed any dates yet, but I’m sure we’ll see that in the future.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> All right. Secretary Blinken, thank you so much for speaking with us here at CNN-News18.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Thanks for having me, appreciate it.</p>
