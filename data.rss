					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p class="p1">The United States is revitalizing our multilateral partnerships to advance our shared prosperity, security, and values in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p class="p1">This week, I was honored to represent the United States at the annual U.S.-ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting.  The United States remains firmly committed to the ASEAN-centered regional architecture, and we strongly support the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p class="p1">Our strategic partnership with ASEAN is focused on our most urgent challenges: fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and building a sustainable economic recovery.  To date, the United States has provided over 23 million doses of vaccines to ASEAN members and over $158 million in emergency COVID-19 assistance.  We provide these vaccines free of charge with no political or economic strings attached.</p>
<p class="p1">The United States intends to provide an additional $500,000 to the ASEAN COVID-19 Response Fund to support the purchase of even more life-saving vaccines.  This builds on our close work with ASEAN regional health authorities on an ASEAN Public Health Emergency Coordination System.</p>
<p class="p1">To aid in economic recovery, I announced <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-support-for-the-asean-outlook-on-the-indo-pacific/"><span class="s1">new programs</span></a> to support ASEAN small- and medium-sized enterprises, build public-private partnerships, and help the region’s digital development and green growth.  This work builds on our already strong economic foundations: U.S. foreign direct investment in ASEAN countries totaled $328.5 billion as of 2020, making the United States ASEAN’s largest source of investment.  U.S. exports from almost 42,000 companies across all fifty states support more than 625,000 U.S. jobs.</p>
<p class="p1">I also announced new initiatives to strengthen the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative and our programs that build upon our already strong people-to-people ties.  These programs will both bring more Southeast Asian students to study in the United States and support local innovation through grants for young leaders working to strengthen civic education and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">These grants are just one component of our commitment to work with ASEAN to combat the climate crisis.  As I told my ASEAN counterparts, </span>we have an opportunity to pursue a green recovery that both supports economic growth and puts us on a pathway to achieving our climate goals.</p>
<p class="p1">During my meeting with ASEAN, I called on the Burmese military junta to immediately end the violence, restore democratic governance, and release those unjustly detained.  We also urged our ASEAN partners to hold the junta accountable to the April 24 ASEAN leaders’ five-point consensus.  In that regard, I welcomed the appointment of Bruneian Foreign Minister II Erywan as ASEAN’s Special Envoy to Burma.</p>
<p class="p1">I am proud of the ways that we are expanding our strong, strategic partnership.  The United States is committed to supporting the prosperity of our ASEAN partners and to working with ASEAN to advance peace, prosperity, and security in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p class="p1">The United States is ASEAN’s strategic partner and remains steadfast in its support for ASEAN-centered regional architecture at the heart of the Indo-Pacific.  We applaud ASEAN’s Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and welcome the strong principles upon which it is based – inclusivity, openness, and a region based on rule of law, good governance, and respect for international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.  These principles are mirrored in the U.S. vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.  The United States is committed to working with ASEAN under the Outlook to advance peace, prosperity, and security in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p class="p2">More than $3.5 trillion in trade transits Indo-Pacific waters annually.  These waters also provide livelihoods for millions of people.  In order to create a more secure region, the United States seeks to improve maritime cooperation and uphold international law and standards to resolve geopolitical challenges, including in the South China Sea.  ASEAN and the United States are working together to promote the sustainable development of maritime resources.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p class="p1">The United States has provided more than 23 million vaccine doses and over $158 million in emergency health and humanitarian assistance to ASEAN members to fight COVID-19 and is committed to a comprehensive set of actions towards ending the global pandemic in 2022.  These include vaccinating some of the world’s most vulnerable communities, providing emergency supplies to countries in need, bolstering world-wide economic recovery, and positioning the international community to prepare for, prevent, detect, and respond to future biological catastrophes.</p>
<p class="p1">The United States has made a $2 billion contribution to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance for the COVAX Advance Market Commitment, which supports access to safe and effective vaccines for 92 low- and middle-income economies.  This is the largest single financial contribution for COVAX.</p>
<p class="p1">As of August 2021, the United States had allocated 80 million vaccine doses from its own supply to support COVAX and partners around the world and encouraged other nations to do the same.  U.S. vaccines have already been delivered to several ASEAN member states, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p class="p1">Additionally, the United States will be providing 500 million Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to Gavi for distribution by COVAX to 92 countries around the world and the African Union, with delivery starting in August 2021.  This is the largest single donation of vaccines and comprises half of the G7+ commitment to provide one billion safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine doses, especially to the world’s most vulnerable people.</p>

<p class="p1">The United States has provided more than 23 million vaccine doses and over $158 million in emergency health and humanitarian assistance to ASEAN members to fight COVID-19 and is committed to a comprehensive set of actions towards ending the global pandemic in 2022.  These include vaccinating some of the world’s most vulnerable communities, providing emergency supplies to countries in need, bolstering world-wide economic recovery, and positioning the international community to prepare for, prevent, detect, and respond to future biological catastrophes.</p>
<p class="p1">The United States has made a $2 billion contribution to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance for the COVAX Advance Market Commitment, which supports access to safe and effective vaccines for 92 low- and middle-income economies.  This is the largest single financial contribution for COVAX.</p>
<p class="p1">As of August 2021, the United States had allocated 80 million vaccine doses from its own supply to support COVAX and partners around the world and encouraged other nations to do the same.  U.S. vaccines have already been delivered to several ASEAN member states, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p class="p1">Additionally, the United States will be providing 500 million Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to Gavi for distribution by COVAX to 92 countries around the world and the African Union, with delivery starting in August 2021.  This is the largest single donation of vaccines and comprises half of the G7+ commitment to provide one billion safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine doses, especially to the world’s most vulnerable people.</p>
