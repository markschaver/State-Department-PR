<p>Delegations of the C5+1 – the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, the Republic of Uzbekistan, and the United States of America – participated in the July 15-16, 2021 International Conference on “Central and South Asia: Regional Connectivity. Challenges and Opportunities” in Tashkent.</p>
<p>The C5+1 countries affirm their commitment to enhancing engagement through our regional diplomatic platform and seeking opportunities to strengthen connectivity between the Central and South Asian regions via trade, transport, and energy links. The C5+1 recognizes that increased connectivity supports its shared goal of a prosperous and secure Central Asia. Visionary ideas for Central Asia’s economic growth and closer ties to the economies of South Asia also reinforce the C5+1’s commitment to strengthening the region’s security and stability, including through Afghan peace negotiations.</p>
<p>The C5+1 endeavors to build upon the collaborative progress it has made on connectivity, including to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modernize infrastructure and transit potential in Central Asia, including through the implementation of investment projects;</li>
<li>Promote increased regional cooperation in support of transboundary business-to-business connections and people-to-people exchanges;</li>
<li>Improve energy sector connectivity and performance, including to expand and effectively integrate renewables;</li>
<li>Meet and strengthen goals on climate adaptation, air quality, and water cooperation and protect those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change;</li>
<li>Uphold human rights and freedoms, further strengthen the rule of law and good governance, based on universal human values and the historical, cultural, civilizational, and spiritual identity of the people of South and Central Asia, restore cultural and humanitarian ties, and promote the inclusion of all people, across all efforts, to support the region’s sustainable economic development<em>;</em></li>
<li>Ease trade, transport, and communication between South and Central Asia, including through Afghanistan;</li>
<li>Create stable and prosperous conditions favorable to the Afghan peace process, including reaffirming to all parties: the urgency of substantive negotiations on a political settlement; that the only path to a just and durable peace is through a negotiated political settlement that results in an inclusive political system and respects the fundamental rights of all Afghans; that there is no support for the imposition by force of a new government in Afghanistan; and that terrorists and third party forces must never be allowed to use Afghan territory to threaten or attack the C5+1 countries or any other country;</li>
<li>Advance cooperation with Afghanistan across security, energy, economic, trade, cultural, and other lines of effort; and,</li>
<li>Cooperate to address challenges and threats to regional security, prosperity, and stability.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>On July 16, the U.S. Department of State, along with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, issued a <a href="https://www.state.gov/risks-and-considerations-for-businesses-operating-in-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTA3MTYuNDMzMDY1MTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZS5nb3Yvcmlza3MtYW5kLWNvbnNpZGVyYXRpb25zLWZvci1idXNpbmVzc2VzLW9wZXJhdGluZy1pbi1ob25nLWtvbmcvIn0.fD8__wQf4hPE5ZH7G7eBgr7NQDdcBBkJUEPXKQgT9DQ/s/1039202793/br/109441528434-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626536328855000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMIs2XUnCWxtMSC0IOVu6FJ9YVog">business advisory</a> to caution U.S. businesses about emerging risks to their operations and activities in Hong Kong. Many of these risks stem from the implementation of the Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, also known as the National Security Law (NSL), and other recent legislative changes.</p>
<p>Developments over the last year in Hong Kong present clear operational, financial, legal, and reputational risks for multinational firms. This business advisory provides companies with information that can assist them in making informed business decisions and properly assessing risk.</p>
<p>The policies which the PRC government and the Government of Hong Kong have implemented undermine the legal and regulatory environment that is critical for individuals and businesses to operate freely and with legal certainty in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Businesses should be aware that the risks faced in mainland China are now increasingly present in Hong Kong. The National Security Law and actions taken by PRC and Hong Kong authorities may negatively affect their staff, finances, legal compliance, reputation, and operations.</p>
<p>The advisory highlights the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Businesses operating in Hong Kong, as well as individuals and businesses conducting business on their behalf, are subject to the laws of Hong Kong, including the National Security Law. Foreign nationals, including one U.S. citizen, have been arrested under the NSL.</em></li>
<li><em>Businesses face risks associated with electronic surveillance without warrants and the surrender of corporate and customer data to authorities.</em></li>
<li><em>Businesses that rely on a free and open press may face restricted access to information.</em></li>
<li><em>Individuals and entities should be aware of potential consequences of certain types of engagement with sanctioned individuals or entities.</em></li>
<li><em>Businesses operating in Hong Kong may face heightened risks and uncertainty related to PRC retaliation against companies that comply with sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries, including through enforcement of the PRC’s Countering Foreign Sanctions Law.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses with potential exposure should be aware of the potential reputational, economic, and legal risks of maintaining a presence or staff in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In order to mitigate reputational and other risks, businesses should apply industry due diligence policies and procedures to address applicable and identified risks.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Over the past year, People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Hong Kong officials have systematically undermined Hong Kong’s democratic <wbr />institutions, delayed elections, disqualified elected lawmakers from office, and forced officials to take loyalty oaths to keep their jobs.  Since protests began in 2019, local authorities have arrested thousands for speaking out against government policies with which they disagreed, including for their social media posts and for attending vigils.  Journalists have been arrested simply for doing their jobs in reporting on the government’s activities and repressive efforts against protesters.  Hong Kong authorities have mounted a persistent and politically motivated campaign against the free press, imprisoned <em>Apple Daily</em> founder Jimmy Lai, and forced the closure of that publication – a bastion of independent reporting.  Beijing has chipped away at Hong Kong’s reputation of <wbr />accountable, transparent governance and respect for individual freedoms, and <wbr />has broken its promise to leave Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy unchanged for 50 years.</p>
<p>We will continue to stand up for the rights and freedoms guaranteed to people in Hong Kong by the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.  In the face of Beijing’s decisions over the past year that have stifled the democratic aspirations of people in Hong Kong, we are taking action.  Today we send a clear message that the United States resolutely stands with Hong Kongers.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting Accountability:  </strong>The Department of State has designated Chen Dong, Yang Jianping, Qiu Hong, Lu Xinning, Tan Tieniu, He Jing, and Yin Zonghua, who are Deputy Directors of the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (LOCPG).  The LOCPG is the PRC’s main platform for projecting its influence in Hong Kong and has repeatedly undermined the high degree of autonomy promised for Hong Kong in the Sino – British Joint declaration. The seven officials are being designated under Executive Order 13936.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency:  </strong>Hong Kong’s business environment has deteriorated in the past year.  The many legal, financial, operational, and reputational risks long present in mainland China are now increasingly prevalent in Hong Kong.  A healthy business and investment climate requires a transparent regulatory framework and adherence to the rule of law.  Today, the Department of State, together with the Department of Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of the Treasury, released a <a href="https://www.state.gov/risks-and-considerations-for-businesses-operating-in-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTA3MTYuNDMzMDU2MDEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZS5nb3Yvcmlza3MtYW5kLWNvbnNpZGVyYXRpb25zLWZvci1idXNpbmVzc2VzLW9wZXJhdGluZy1pbi1ob25nLWtvbmcvIn0.WMzMcPnWSjxXqKMU3F9ypPhhJK-B_12EK7tP3Kcr-38/s/1039202793/br/109440623462-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626535512298000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEw_vwTjBH_9urEqCFSNvwrw2ytVA">Business Advisory </a>warning of increased risks for businesses in Hong Kong.  These risks include those introduced by the National Security Law and other new legislation, potential electronic surveillance and lack of data privacy, reduced access to information, and potential retaliation <wbr />against companies for their compliance with U.S. sanctions.  The business advisory outlines these emerging risks to inform U.S. individuals and businesses and recommends increased awareness and due diligence.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is deeply troubled by the Georgian Parliament’s July 12 approval of six Supreme Court nominees, in contravention of the April 19 agreement between ruling and opposition party representatives.</p>
<p>Mediated by the EU and the United States under the auspices of European Council President Charles Michel, the April 19 agreement committed the signatories to pause &#8220;all ongoing appointments&#8221; to the Supreme Court until passage of &#8220;ambitious judicial reform&#8221; in a broad, inclusive, and multiparty reform process.</p>
<p>We urge Georgia’s authorities to implement the April 19 agreement, including by suspending Supreme Court appointments pending comprehensive, transparent, and inclusive judicial reform.  This is what Georgia’s political leaders, including the ruling party, agreed to do.  Failure to do so would further undermine the Georgian public&#8217;s and international community&#8217;s confidence in Georgia&#8217;s judiciary and risk undermining Georgia’s democratic development.  Incomplete implementation of the April 19 agreement could also weaken investor confidence and diminish the resilience of Georgia’s political and social institutions.</p>
<p>The United States calls on Georgian authorities to restore their commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law, while reinvigorating their partnership with the United States and international community.</p>
