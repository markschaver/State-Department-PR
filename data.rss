					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Panama City, Panama</p>
<p>Westin Playa Bonita Panama</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT COHEN:</strong>  (Via interpreter) (In progress) irregular migration.  We have been creating tourism and increasing (inaudible) irregular migration going through the borders  (inaudible).  Given these conditions, we have – there are victims of criminal organizations.  They’re exposed to multiple risks that attempt against human rights.</p>
<p>Facing this reality, we cannot be indifferent.  Our countries also work in a coordinated manner to find solutions in the short, medium, and long range.  We have an international humanitarian approach with shared responsibility among the countries of origin, transit, and final destination of these irregular migrants.  That is why we have to strengthen the policies of the region to be able to drive the economic growth in our countries to generate human growth opportunities and to create better living conditions for our peoples.</p>
<p>It is fundamental, achieving joint agreements and articulated agreements to tackle this migration phenomenon (inaudible) humanitarian organizations.  It is opportune to highlight what I mentioned already in the General Assembly of the United Nations back in September.  Irregular migration is possibly the (inaudible).  It demands a joint effort of coordinated strategies and enough resources to anticipate the humanitarian crisis in the region of great preparations.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Panama is a (inaudible) standing in the flood of this irregular migration.  We have created a lot of efforts to tackle proactively and positively and with a humanitarian approach.  And we have coordinated (inaudible) states acting immediately and facing this challenge with (inaudible) because we understand that we cannot just stay talking, facing a problem like this.</p>
<p>Today I reaffirm Panama’s commitment to work jointly with friendly countries as strategic partners in the search of joint solutions with cross-sectional policies and concrete actions that will promote regular migrations, orderly and safe, respecting human rights.  I do appreciate all of you here present for your participation, your will, and determination to work in a regional integration to tackle the irregular migration phenomenon within the context of international migration.  Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>MR VASQUEZ: </strong> (Via interpreter) Ladies and gentlemen, having heard the opening remarks of His Excellency the President of Panama, Mr. Laurentino Cortizo Cohen, we open the floor to Erika Mouynes, Foreign Relations Minister, who will open the ministerial regional meeting on migration.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MOUYNES: </strong> (Via interpreter)  Good morning, everyone.  I would like to thank one more time your attendance, for just by being here is a clear support to the initiative to tackle the impact on irregular migration in a continental manner.  We all care, we have made this a priority, and we need to work together.  Migration is a current phenomenon and it is a complex one.  It is a world phenomenon.  And this phenomenon in particular responds to particular joint circumstances that magnify the COVID pandemic, climate change, war, conflict, and economic issues.  By working together with our neighboring countries and the United States, we are trying to approach this phenomenon in a responsible, effective, and humanitarian-focused way for which we have advocated since the very beginning, like our president said.</p>
<p>Figures are clear.  In August of 2021, influx through the Darién border came to a peak of 2,800 migrants in a day.  Today, it doesn’t go over 100 daily.  So we have motives to be optimistic, but we cannot falter because, one more time, the figures are still increasing.  Reality is harsh, and these events of – which are unexpected create migration waves and compels us to be prepared not only to be able to offer assistance but also not to have a negative impact.  There will be always cataclysms, new conflicts, but we can create effective and long-lasting control with a regional and continental strategy, but it has to be a permanent role.</p>
<p>Today we are providing continuity to something that we already began.  So today before we begin we should have three set objectives: one, coming to agreement in a working framework that will facilitate the standardization of migration policies in the region; number two, broaden the efforts of collaboration to fight trans-country organized crime; and number three, to concrete the cooperation dynamics among states, international organizations, and development banking in the region to have the structural basis to stop the structural basis that prompt migration.</p>
<p>Friends, your presence here is important, and it conveys the will to work together, sharing this responsibility to approach this challenge that is going to define the 21st century.  It will be collaboration, commitment, and consensus that always works.  Today we have an opportunity to speak with one voice, being certain that our meeting will mark a milestone in the history of our continent.  Thank you so much.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good morning, everyone, and Erika, thank you so much for bringing us all together.  We are all living what is truly a historic challenge, and that is the fact that more people on our planet are on the move, forcibly displaced from their homes, than at any time since the Second World War.  That is the magnitude of the challenge, and we feel it strongly in our own hemisphere.  We’re focusing on different aspects of the problem today.</p>
<p>This morning in this first session, I know we want to focus on one particularly urgent aspect of the challenge:  How can we more effectively work together to help stabilize and strengthen communities across the region that are generously hosting large numbers of migrants and refugees?  The millions of people who have made the difficult and often dangerous decision to leave their homes we know do so for a variety of reasons – poverty, a lack of economic opportunity, repressive governance, corruption, political upheaval, conflict and insecurity.  All of these challenges already there are exacerbated by COVID-19 and by the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we all know this: the only lasting, sustainable response to irregular migration is to tackle its root causes.  But that takes time.  And in the meantime, many cities and towns simply don’t have the resources they need to provide for their own citizens, much less meeting the needs of migrants who are with them.</p>
<p>As Erika said, we know that no country, no community can solve a challenge as complicated as irregular migration alone.  We have to work together to support the front-line communities hosting migrants and refugees with increased resources for public health and safety, for stronger social services, for more resilient infrastructure, for opportunity for all – for migrants and host communities alike.</p>
<p>We’re making some progress.  Just to cite a few examples.  Colombia has registered more than 1.9 million Venezuelans for temporary protected status, and more than 600,000 have officially received that status.  That gives them documentation and legal protections that are critical for integrating into their local community.</p>
<p>It also means that more migrants can be vaccinated against COVID-19, which is critical to ending the pandemic and boosting economic recovery.</p>
<p>In that same spirit, the United States is expediting family-based petitions at our embassies throughout Central America so that migrants with family members in the United States are able to go there sponsored by the family members, and they can move much more quickly through the process as a result.</p>
<p>We’re also expanding visas for eligible groups – for example, 20,000 additional H2B temporary agricultural worker visas that Secretary Mayorkas recently announced.  And a critical piece of this is the role that multilateral finance and development institutions have been doing to provide more resources to front-line communities.  We have to work together to bring these efforts to scale throughout the hemisphere.</p>
<p>Again, with some examples.  The Inter-American Development Bank is boosting public health education and social protection in migrant host cities in Ecuador.  In Belize, the bank is running programs to increase educational opportunity for girls both from migrant families and from local communities.  And again, this is such a critical piece.  The support that we need to give to migrants we have to find ways also to make sure that local communities are getting support, getting help – are benefitting.  Otherwise, we know that none of this will be sustainable – politically, economically, socially.</p>
<p>In five Colombian cities, the bank is facilitating housing and helping local governments build institutional capacity to assist migrants, both of which are critical for them to integrate more seamlessly into our communities.  The World Bank’s Global Concessional Financing Facility has been instrumental in providing development assistance to countries worldwide that are affected by the refugee crisis, including economic and social support to Colombian communities hosting Venezuelan refugees.</p>
<p>So programs like these help point the way forward.  We need that kind of cross-cutting coordination – local and national governments, multilateral institutions, businesses, civil society – all working toward safe, orderly, and humane migration throughout the region and supporting the communities so that they can do right by these vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>Of course, even as we’re doing this, as I said at the outset, we have to remain resolutely focused on addressing root causes, in particular some of the economic drivers of migration, and there, again, we’re making some progress.  To name just one example, Vice President Harris’ call to action to the private sector just several months ago has rallied $1.2 billion in investments to support long-term social and economic progress in northern Central America.</p>
<p>Finally, many of us will meet again in Los Angeles for the Summit of the Americas in just a few weeks’ time in June.  There, we’ll have an opportunity to address the deeper issues driving irregular migration like improving public health, strengthening our democracies.  By adopting a Los Angeles declaration on migration and protection that sets forth our shared principles for a collaborative, coordinated response to migration and forced displacement as President Biden has proposed, our countries can take our partnership on this issue to the next level of effectiveness, and we can make a profound difference in the lives of our most vulnerable fellow citizens and in the future of our shared region.</p>
<p>So I hope we can use our time together as well today to lay the groundwork for a strong declaration by our leaders when they gather in California in June.  But to each and every one of you, we’ve been working together over many months now at the United Nations, Colombia, here in Panama.  Thank you.  Thank you for your commitment.  Thank you for your leadership.  Thank you for your partnership as we work together to promote safe, orderly, and humane migration across the Americas.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Panama City, Panama</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you very much.  Good evening, everyone.  It is wonderful to be with so many colleagues in this extraordinary setting with this extraordinary history, as Erika was just describing it to us.  I very much want to thank President Cortizo, my friend the foreign minister, the people of Panama, for so generously hosting us for this week’s Ministerial Conference on Migration and Protection.  And a special note of gratitude to Panama, to you, Erika, for all the work that you’ve been doing to bring all of us together in what has to be a shared responsibility.</p>
<p>I am joined here by my friend and colleague, Ale Mayorkas, the Secretary of Homeland Security of the United States.  We’re both so eager to discuss with our fellow ministers the urgent migration challenges that we’re facing.  No two countries experience them in the same way.  All of us bring our own concerns to this discussion but also this sense of shared responsibility to meet the migration challenge throughout our region.  And we’re very much looking forward to hearing and sharing specific experiences and specific solutions.</p>
<p>This issue is a priority for the United States.  We have a strong interest in protecting the security of our borders in a safe, orderly, and humane way.  We care about the well-being of millions of people across the hemisphere who have made the desperate decision to leave their homes and communities in search of a better life.  The journeys are often dangerous.  Migrants are vulnerable to exploitation of all kinds.  Many are children, and their fates, their futures, are highly uncertain.  We have a responsibility, a shared responsibility, to look out for them.</p>
<p>Like you, we’re concerned about the rising tensions in communities across the region that have become home to huge numbers of migrants and are now pushed to the brink, unable to meet people’s needs, whether they’re migrants or their own citizens.  And we’re focused on the underlying issues that are pushing so many people to become migrants in the first place, including poverty, a lack of economic opportunity, corruption, political upheaval, insecurity – all of which has been made worse by the climate crisis and, of course, by COVID-19.</p>
<p>So I think what we have all come to understand, the common realization that I think is shared with everyone in this room, is that no one country can meet these challenges or solve them alone.  The United States is committed to working in partnership with all of you across every dimension of this issue from taking on migrant smuggling networks, to improving humane and effective border management, to countering misinformation, to developing legal pathways for immigrants and refugees seeking a safe place to call home.</p>
<p>In particular, we have to work together to help stabilize and strengthen communities that are hosting large populations of migrants.  We have to help them get the tools that they need to rebuild their lives, including access to jobs and education.  And we have to make sure that our support directly benefits the communities themselves with increased resources for public health and safety, social services, better infrastructure, opportunity for everyone.</p>
<p>So this has to be a job for all of us, for our governments, doing it together.  But it’s also a job for the international community writ large – NGOs, multilateral development and financial institutions, regional and global public health and climate agencies.  The United States will help bring together these different groups and leverage all of their contributions to this challenge.</p>
<p>I have to tell you I’m very glad to see here tonight and tomorrow as we meet representatives from key organizations, including the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF.  Institutions like these were created to help us meet challenges too great for even our countries together to solve, which is exactly what we’re called on to do now on behalf of the region’s most vulnerable people.  And to those agencies and organizations that have already given and implemented assistance, thank you.</p>
<p>I know that we’ll do good work together here in Panama.  We have to.  And I hope that the additional momentum that we build here, complemented by what we did in Colombia – and my deep appreciation to our colleagues from Colombia for bringing us together some months ago – all of that needs to carry forward in concrete, practical ways.</p>
<p>In June, many of us will come together again in Los Angeles for the Summit of the Americas that President Biden will be hosting.  There we’ll have an opportunity to address the deeper concerns that drive irregular migration by strengthening our democracies, fighting corruption, building resilience in our health care systems, promoting more equitable economic growth, combating the climate crisis.  All of these things in their own ways have an impact on the challenge that we are coming together here tonight and tomorrow to deal with.</p>
<p>President Biden set a goal for the summit that our countries adopt a declaration on migration and protection that sets forth shared principles for a collaborative, coordinated response to migration and forced displacement.  So I hope our discussions here today and tomorrow in Panama will contribute to a strong declaration by our leaders when they gather in California in just a few weeks’ time.</p>
<p>So, simply put, to each and every one of you, thank you for your leadership at what is a critical moment.  Erika said it very well.  There is – we have a regional challenge, a hemispheric challenge, but it’s also a global challenge.  There are now around the world more people on the move, displaced from their homes, than at any time since the Second World War, some 95 million people.  By definition, this is a challenge that we have to stand together to meet, work together to meet, join together to meet.</p>
<p>With that, it is my pleasure to introduce my friend and colleague, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><b><strong>SECRETARY MAYORKAS:  </strong></b>Thank you and good evening.  My thanks to President Cortizo, Ministers Mouynes and Pino, for welcoming us to this beautiful country.  Earlier today I visited the Panama Canal, and it was a very uplifting visit.  I did so with my colleague and great friend, Tony Blinken.  And the canal represents the promise of economic prosperity and the hope for advancement, and not just today but in the days to come.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a very different visit.  Minister Pino so generously gave of his time to show my colleagues and me the Darién region and to pass over the treacherous land that the most vulnerable people try to pass in the hope of a better future.  It is very difficult to see that land and to understand the depths and breadth of the treachery that vulnerable individuals seek to cross with the hope of a better life.</p>
<p>I remember a father of a friend of mine growing up who grew up in very difficult circumstances once said that one’s – when one’s back is up against the wall, the only direction one can move in is forward.  And it is our obligation collectively to close the divide between the promise of economic prosperity that the canal represents and the vulnerability that the Darién region represents for so many who seek a better life.  And I want to thank the ministers for bringing us all together to work on an effort that requires a collective response, because the movement of people in the Western Hemisphere, and frankly in other parts of the world, is not the challenge of one country or two; it is the challenge of the region and of the hemisphere of which we are a part.  And we must take a look at the individuals who are vulnerable as members of our community, and we must deliver a response of and by the community.</p>
<p>The most enduring way in which we can address this challenge which has been with us for far too many years is to deliver stabilization, to deliver for the people in their homes the promise that the canal represents, and allow them to understand and actually realize that they do not need to leave their homes to experience the promise that so many of us here represent and are obligated to deliver to others.</p>
<p>At the same time, as we work on that most enduring solution of addressing the cause for migration, we must also extend a hand, an outstretched hand, of humanitarian relief to those who are already outside of their homes to be able to provide them with the promise of that prosperity wherever they might be so that the dangers of the journey that they once anticipated ahead of them they need no longer take.  The promise of humanitarian relief and the stability of settlement and integration, as well as an understanding that the laws that guide our extension of humanitarian relief must be honored, and for those who do not qualify we must apply those laws equally.</p>
<p>These issues and the lines that draw – are drawn between the relief and the response that we must impose when that relief is not warranted are very, very difficult to draw.  They are very difficult decisions, but we as leaders in our respective countries, and together as leaders of a community throughout a region and a hemisphere, are obligated to make those difficult decisions, and that is what makes this convening so very important – bringing us together to make those difficult decisions in partnership and in friendship with one another so that we can deliver the promise of a better future to those who do not see it and so that we can accept this responsibility in a shared and, therefore, most effective way.</p>
<p>I thank you all so very much.  I look forward to our very important conversations tomorrow.  And again, my thanks to our wonderful hosts here in this beautiful country of Panama.  <em>Gracias</em>.  (Applause.)<input type="hidden" data-filter="111000000001" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Panama City, Panama</p>
<p>American Trade Hotel</p>
<p><strong>MS OBALDIA:  </strong>Good afternoon, everybody.  My name is Olga de Obaldía.  I am the executive director of the Panama Chapter of Transparency International.  Our organization is called Foundation for the Development of Civil Liberties, or <em>Fundación para el Desarrollo de la Libertad Ciudadana</em>.  It is a pleasure for us, our organizations from the nongovernmental sector that are interested in democratic institutions, anticorruption, and transparency, to welcome today to Panama Mr. Secretary Antony Blinken, and I would like to welcome as well the government officials that are here, the embassy officials that are here, the champions of corruption from three countries – Venezuela, Guatemala, and Ecuador – and local activists that are our comrades-in-arm in this fight against corruption in Panama.</p>
<p>I’ve been asked to give you a brief introduction before I’ll let you hear from the star of the meeting, Mr. Blinken, and I’ll start by mentioning something about the American Trade Hotel where we are right now.  The American Trade Hotel and Plaza Herrera – Herrera – just in front of us here are symbols of the resilience of Panama in the – and we are in the Old Historic District of Panama.  This plaza dates from colonial times, and the building where we are right now – sorry – and the building where we are right now dates from the republican period.  It was built in 1917 and housed the American Trade Development Company, and in the hall next door was the first Citibank that helped finance the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>After falling through disrepair, it ended up housing dangerous gangs in the ‘60s, ‘70s, ‘80s, ‘90s, and the 2000s, and at some point the building was called the Grey Skull Castle, if you can imagine that.  And through community movement and local investors, the building was rescued and it’s right now one of the symbols of Panama’s resilience.  Panama has been through colonial times, republican times, to a dictatorship, to an invasion, and a new era of uninterrupted democracy since 1990.</p>
<p>However, our democracy right now is being threatened by corruption in multiple fronts.  I will just mention four of them, and I’m sure that most of the local press and the local officials are very well informed of what we are facing through regarding corruption and lack of transparency.</p>
<p>To start with, let me mention the critical impact of the impunity and the judiciary; second, the corrupt clientelist structure and practices in the national assembly that trickles down to communities and affects electoral fairness; third, a lack of fiscal accountability in the use of public resources; and fourth, a lack of a robust legal framework to fight and prevent corruption in the public and the private sector.</p>
<p>Our instruments to measure corruption are telling us that Panama is stagnant in the fight against corruption.  For the last 10 years, Panama has had an average rating of 36 over 100 in the Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International.  Moreover, the last transparency index of our parliament showed that Panama has the fourth most opaque parliament or congress in the whole of the Americas.  That has an impact, a terrible impact, on the population, and in the last few years, Panama’s population has been showing a lack of faith in democracy.  Sixty-five of Panamanian – 65 percent of Panamanian citizens, when asked, are not choosing democracy as their favorite form of government.</p>
<p>On top of that, we need to understand that the relationship between national security and corruption that was so well outlined in the June 3rd memo of the White House regarding the matter is the same thing in Panama.  Our national security right now is being threatened by the inclusion in politics and private financing of politics for monies that are known to be from organized crime.  And I think you all – most of you know about these facts, and I think this is enough for me.  I thank you for the opportunity of talking to you about these matters that are extremely important for us, and I give you Secretary Antony Blinken.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  And I appreciate very much the reference to being a featured attraction, but the truth of the matter is these are the stars of the evening – our colleagues who are on the front lines of fighting corruption in various parts of our hemisphere.</p>
<p>We’re here principally because our friends and colleagues in Panama are bringing together countries from around the hemisphere to help deal with the extraordinary phenomenon of irregular migration.  But one of the things we know very well is that one of the drivers of that irregular migration is corruption and the revulsion at corruption that people are feeling in many countries in our hemisphere and around the world.</p>
<p>If you look at, as well, the drivers of so many popular movements in every part of the world over the last couple of decades, you often find a revulsion at corruption as being one of if not the driver of these movements.  And there’s a good, good reason for that, as Olga said so well.  It is draining resources from countries that could be put to much better use supporting the people and supporting their needs.  It breeds incredible and understandable cynicism about government and about leadership.  It fuels all sorts of illicit enterprises.  And of course, it helps perpetuate nondemocratic rule in country after country.</p>
<p>So it is at the source of so many challenges, and we are incredibly gratified that we have champions who at great, often personal risk, as well as professional risk are leading the effort to uncover corruption, to create greater transparency in their societies, to prosecute those responsible – and again, in some cases at such risk that you’ve had to leave the countries that you’re from for your own safety and well-being.</p>
<p>The United States is working hard to support these efforts throughout our hemisphere and indeed around the world.  Part of it is by elevating the work of those who are combating corruption, and we are honored and proud to do it.  Part of it is by supporting civil society through the funding, assistance, training that we give.  Part of it is trying to make sure that we’re doing what we can to protect those who are on the front lines of this effort.</p>
<p>So I was really anxious to be here, not to talk to you but to hear from you, to listen to the work that you’re doing, the challenges you’re facing, and to learn a little bit about how we can do even better and do even more to help in this fight and to help you in your efforts.  So let me turn it over to you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Panama City, Panama</p>
<p>American Trade Hotel</p>
<p><strong>MS OBALDIA:  </strong>Good afternoon, everybody.  My name is Olga de Obaldía.  I am the executive director of the Panama Chapter of Transparency International.  Our organization is called Foundation for the Development of Civil Liberties, or <em>Fundación para el Desarrollo de la Libertad Ciudadana</em>.  It is a pleasure for us, our organizations from the nongovernmental sector that are interested in democratic institutions, anticorruption, and transparency, to welcome today to Panama Mr. Secretary Antony Blinken, and I would like to welcome as well the government officials that are here, the embassy officials that are here, the champions of corruption from three countries – Venezuela, Guatemala, and Ecuador – and local activists that are our comrades-in-arm in this fight against corruption in Panama.</p>
<p>I’ve been asked to give you a brief introduction before I’ll let you hear from the star of the meeting, Mr. Blinken, and I’ll start by mentioning something about the American Trade Hotel where we are right now.  The American Trade Hotel and Plaza Herrera – Herrera – just in front of us here are symbols of the resilience of Panama in the – and we are in the Old Historic District of Panama.  This plaza dates from colonial times, and the building where we are right now – sorry – and the building where we are right now dates from the republican period.  It was built in 1917 and housed the American Trade Development Company, and in the hall next door was the first Citibank that helped finance the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>After falling through disrepair, it ended up housing dangerous gangs in the ‘60s, ‘70s, ‘80s, ‘90s, and the 2000s, and at some point the building was called the Grey Skull Castle, if you can imagine that.  And through community movement and local investors, the building was rescued and it’s right now one of the symbols of Panama’s resilience.  Panama has been through colonial times, republican times, to a dictatorship, to an invasion, and a new era of uninterrupted democracy since 1990.</p>
<p>However, our democracy right now is being threatened by corruption in multiple fronts.  I will just mention four of them, and I’m sure that most of the local press and the local officials are very well informed of what we are facing through regarding corruption and lack of transparency.</p>
<p>To start with, let me mention the critical impact of the impunity and the judiciary; second, the corrupt clientelist structure and practices in the national assembly that trickles down to communities and affects electoral fairness; third, a lack of fiscal accountability in the use of public resources; and fourth, a lack of a robust legal framework to fight and prevent corruption in the public and the private sector.</p>
<p>Our instruments to measure corruption are telling us that Panama is stagnant in the fight against corruption.  For the last 10 years, Panama has had an average rating of 36 over 100 in the Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International.  Moreover, the last transparency index of our parliament showed that Panama has the fourth most opaque parliament or congress in the whole of the Americas.  That has an impact, a terrible impact, on the population, and in the last few years, Panama’s population has been showing a lack of faith in democracy.  Sixty-five of Panamanian – 65 percent of Panamanian citizens, when asked, are not choosing democracy as their favorite form of government.</p>
<p>On top of that, we need to understand that the relationship between national security and corruption that was so well outlined in the June 3rd memo of the White House regarding the matter is the same thing in Panama.  Our national security right now is being threatened by the inclusion in politics and private financing of politics for monies that are known to be from organized crime.  And I think you all – most of you know about these facts, and I think this is enough for me.  I thank you for the opportunity of talking to you about these matters that are extremely important for us, and I give you Secretary Antony Blinken.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  And I appreciate very much the reference to being a featured attraction, but the truth of the matter is these are the stars of the evening – our colleagues who are on the front lines of fighting corruption in various parts of our hemisphere.</p>
<p>We’re here principally because our friends and colleagues in Panama are bringing together countries from around the hemisphere to help deal with the extraordinary phenomenon of irregular migration.  But one of the things we know very well is that one of the drivers of that irregular migration is corruption and the revulsion at corruption that people are feeling in many countries in our hemisphere and around the world.</p>
<p>If you look at, as well, the drivers of so many popular movements in every part of the world over the last couple of decades, you often find a revulsion at corruption as being one of if not the driver of these movements.  And there’s a good, good reason for that, as Olga said so well.  It is draining resources from countries that could be put to much better use supporting the people and supporting their needs.  It breeds incredible and understandable cynicism about government and about leadership.  It fuels all sorts of illicit enterprises.  And of course, it helps perpetuate nondemocratic rule in country after country.</p>
<p>So it is at the source of so many challenges, and we are incredibly gratified that we have champions who at great, often personal risk, as well as professional risk are leading the effort to uncover corruption, to create greater transparency in their societies, to prosecute those responsible – and again, in some cases at such risk that you’ve had to leave the countries that you’re from for your own safety and well-being.</p>
<p>The United States is working hard to support these efforts throughout our hemisphere and indeed around the world.  Part of it is by elevating the work of those who are combating corruption, and we are honored and proud to do it.  Part of it is by supporting civil society through the funding, assistance, training that we give.  Part of it is trying to make sure that we’re doing what we can to protect those who are on the front lines of this effort.</p>
<p>So I was really anxious to be here, not to talk to you but to hear from you, to listen to the work that you’re doing, the challenges you’re facing, and to learn a little bit about how we can do even better and do even more to help in this fight and to help you in your efforts.  So let me turn it over to you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States and Panama have signed a Bilateral Arrangement on Migration and Protection detailing our collaborative commitments to improve migration management, expand stabilization efforts, and increase access to legal pathways and protection for those in the region.  Panama’s Minister of Security Juan Pino joined Embassy Panama City’s Chargé d’Affaires Stewart Tuttle in signing the Arrangement in Panama City on April 19.</p>
<p>This Arrangement on Migration and Protection adds to the expanding regional migration management framework that the United States is developing with counterparts across the Americas.  It also embodies the principles of that regional approach through humane border management, stabilization of displaced populations and host communities, and improved access to protection and legal pathways to provide an alternative to irregular migration.</p>
<p>Following the October 2021 Regional Migration Ministerial in Colombia, with this Arrangement both countries confirm their commitment to those principles for collaborative regional response to historic migration and refugee flows.  We look forward to working with Panama to advance the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection ahead of the Summit of the Americas, which the United States will host in June 2022.</p>
<p>The United States welcomes Panama’s leadership in building a more secure, prosperous, and democratic hemisphere.<input type="hidden" data-filter="111000000001" /></p>
