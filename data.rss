					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The below is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>On April 4, Special Representative for the DPRK Sung Kim met with ROK Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs Noh Kyu-duk in Washington, D.C.  The two jointly condemned the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s March 24 intercontinental ballistic missile launch, which was only the latest in a series of increasingly escalatory DRPK launches this year.  They also reaffirmed the importance of a strong, unified response to these escalatory actions.</p>
<p>The Special Representatives condemned these ballistic missile launches as clear violations of multiple UN Security Council resolutions that posed a serious threat to regional stability.  Special Representative Kim underscored the United States’ ironclad commitment to the security of the ROK, while reaffirming that the United States continues to seek serious and sustained dialogue with the DPRK.  Special Representative Kim stressed the importance of close bilateral coordination with the ROK and other allies and partners as we seek to advance our shared goal of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State is pleased to announce a new paid student internship program beginning with the Fall 2022 internship season. The program is intended to expand opportunities for students of all backgrounds in post-secondary degree programs to gain experience and insight into the variety of careers available in U.S. foreign policy programs and administration of the U.S. Department of State and its diplomatic missions worldwide. By providing paid internships, the Department seeks to remove barriers for students who may not have the financial means to support themselves during an unpaid, volunteer internship.</p>
<p>The Department is currently accepting applications through April 12, 2022, or until 1,000 applications are received. Up to 200 student applicants will be chosen for the Fall 2022 internship season.</p>
<p>The paid student internship program is part of the Department of State’s continued efforts to reflect the diversity of the United States and to encourage individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups to pursue its student and career opportunities.  The Department intends to make all its internships paid in 2023.</p>
<p>The paid student internship program will consider all qualified applicants for the 10-week internships.</p>
<p>Students must meet all the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be a U.S. citizen at the time of application;</li>
<li>Be at least 18 years old;</li>
<li>Be enrolled in an accredited academic institution on at least a part-time basis, pursuing a baccalaureate or graduate degree;</li>
<li>Be in good academic standing with at least a 3.0 GPA;</li>
<li>Be a college junior, senior, or graduate student with at least 60 credit hours completed;</li>
<li>Be able to pass and retain suitability and background clearance requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students selected for the paid internship program will receive pay at the GS-04 level, currently $17.51/hour in the Washington DC locality.  They will also receive transportation to and housing at their duty stations, whether in Washington, D.C. or overseas. As temporary civil service employees of the Department, they will also earn annual leave, sick leave, and time-in-service credit.</p>
<p>For more information about this opportunity, please visit: <a href="https://careers.state.gov/interns-fellows/student-internships/?_ref=a3btmxzbpt0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA0MDQuNTU4OTkyNDEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NhcmVlcnMuc3RhdGUuZ292L2ludGVybi9zdHVkZW50LWludGVybnNoaXBzLz9fcmVmPWEzYnRteHpicHQwIn0.FD6Qz0Ah8eTiCajJpzMNHcPgS9ojx6n6oUA-Q9nEUjE/s/1006560560/br/129279565002-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649173222970000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0vjBk7Nt8ss3u0NvMcRJvv">https://careers.state.gov/<wbr />intern/student-internships/.</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>This morning’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <a class="external-link" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">report on mitigation</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a> makes clear what we can do to stop or slow planetary warming.  The report also reveals how current global efforts to mitigate the climate crisis fall far short of what is needed.  Without full implementation of current national pledges and robust, aggressive, and ambitious further action we cannot keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal within reach.</p>
<p>That is why we have called this the decisive decade.  The IPCC found there are options available now, in all sectors, that can halve global emissions by 2030 – from improving energy efficiency, to halting and reversing global deforestation, to deploying more sustainable transportation and clean energy.  There are ways to improve our chances of success, including more effective decision-making across all levels of government, increased alignment of financial flows with climate outcomes, and enhanced international cooperation.</p>
<p>The report also tells us there is reason for hope.  The IPCC found we are making some progress towards the needed reductions in carbon emissions. With actions already taken, and the pledges made under the Paris Agreement through COP26, we can get closer to limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius, and with additional effort we can keep 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach.</p>
<p>That is why the Administration has made tackling the climate crisis a central part of its agenda from Day One.  The President’s FY 2023 budget request to Congress includes more than $11 billion in international climate finance to avert the worst impacts of climate change and to support developing countries in taking more ambitious climate action.</p>
<p>This report makes it clear:  the tools to stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis are firmly within our grasp.  Nations of the world must be brave enough to use them.</p>

Since 1993, the United States has invested more than $4.2 billion for the safe clearance of landmines and explosive weapons of war, as well as the securing and safe disposal of excess small arms and light weapons and munitions in more than 100 countries and territories. In 2021, the United States funded CWD efforts in 62 countries with more than $265 million.</p>
<p>Our assistance – that of the United States government and our global partners – is crucial to building a more safe, secure, and prosperous world. Thanks to strong bipartisan funding support from Congress, the Department of State looks forward to continuing this important work with other donor countries, those impacted by conflict, and the brave men and women who work in the field to secure at-risk weapons and munitions and clear landmines and other explosive hazards.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>We are following the extremely disturbing accounts of large numbers of people killed earlier this week in the village of Mourah in the Mopti region of central Mali. We offer our condolences to the families of all civilians who died.</p>
<p>We are concerned that many reports suggest that the perpetrators were unaccountable forces from the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group. Other reports claim the Malian Armed Forces (FAMa) had targeted elements of known violent extremist groups. These conflicting reports illustrate the urgent need for the Malian transition authorities to give impartial investigators free, unfettered, and safe access to the area where these tragic events unfolded.</p>
<p>Immediate access to eyewitnesses and to the many individuals who are said to be in government custody is essential set the record straight. We call on Mali’s transition government to grant access to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) to conduct a rigorous investigation as mandated by the UN Security Council. Failure to provide a thorough and credible accounting of the facts and accountability will only serve to sow divisions in Malian society, undermine the credibility, legitimacy, and reputation of the FAMa, drive communities into the hands of violent extremist groups, and create conditions for more violence.</p>
