		<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>National Museum of American Diplomacy</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.</p>
<p>It is wonderful to see everyone here today, particularly for this occasion.  Susan, thank you very much, both for the introduction but also for what you’re doing every day to really bring our diplomacy alive, to bring it to new generations of Americans.  We’re grateful for this.  It’s a remarkable project and one that we’re fully invested in, so thank you.</p>
<p>And Mr. President, it’s so good to have you again in Washington.  We were just in Los Angeles days ago.  It’s wonderful to see you here.  It’s an opportunity, in a small way, for us to return the hospitality that you’ve extended to us over this past year and a half, including my own visit to Bogotá last year, and also to celebrate a truly joyous occasion.  And maybe we’ll do away with the microphone and I’ll try and project.  (Laughter.)  The 200th anniversary of our bilateral relations that we’re celebrating today – I guess we’re giving new meaning to Juneteenth next week as well.</p>
<p>And Mr. President, I really wanted to thank you again publicly, as I just did privately, for not just your participation in the Summit of the Americas, but for Colombia’s leadership in the Summit of the Americas.  We got a lot done for the people of our hemisphere over those three days in Los Angeles, and in no small measure because of Colombia’s leadership, including on the migration declaration, which I may say a few additional words about in a few minutes.  But that leadership, as always, was invaluable.  Our partnership, as always, was invaluable.  And I’m grateful to you, President Biden is grateful to you, for that partnership.</p>
<p>Mr. Ambassador, Ambassador Pinzón, friends for a long time – it’s great to have you here today; other colleagues from across the Government of Colombia:  So I know this is only one in a series of events that have been organized to celebrate our 200 years.  We’re grateful to our colleagues from Colombia for actually, in a sense, hosting the event today, co-hosting it with us.</p>
<p>Our team in Bogotá is also extremely active in organizing celebrations in multiple Colombian cities over the coming days.</p>
<p>And finally, let me say to our colleagues who are here from the Colombian and American private sectors:  Thank you for being here today; thank you for your work every day to strengthen ties between our countries.  The economic bonds that bind us together are strong and growing stronger, and of course, it’s a profound benefit to the people in both of our countries.</p>
<p>It is, I think, fitting that we are celebrating today at the National Museum of American Diplomacy.  How are we doing?  Let’s see.  (Laughter.)  It’s a rogue microphone.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>We have – and I suspect the president will get into this as well – a long history of being bound together, even before 1822, when our formal diplomatic relations began.</p>
<p>From 1806 to 1807, Simon Bolívar spent six months in the United States traveling the East Coast from Charleston, South Carolina, up to cities along the coast, before, of course, leading the independence movement in South America.</p>
<p>Beyond history, we, of course, have been and continue to be enriched immeasurably by Colombia’s culture – the magical realism of Garcia Marquez, the art of Botero, the music of Shakira.  (Laughter.)  Colombia is said to be the land of a thousand rhythms; I suspect Shakira is responsible for 999.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>But to the point that Susan made – and I think it’s really important – this is a relationship that has remained strong over 200 years, even in the most challenging times, and that speaks volumes.  A few decades ago, Colombia’s entire future was on the line, under assault from drug cartels and insurgent groups.  Conflict ravaged the nation.  Many Colombians endured violence or lived in fear of it.  And of course, at that time huge unemployment as well, economic difficulties.</p>
<p>We came together – the United States and Colombia – and I see leaders of that effort in this room today.  We undertook Plan Colombia.  We ended half a century campaign to topple the Colombian Government, as well as a war that killed more than 200,000 people.  Plan Colombia became Peace Colombia, and though many issues remain, Colombia has expanded access to education, to jobs, other social services in its rural areas, and to the country’s underserved communities, including Indigenous and Afro Colombian communities; reformed land laws; established institutions like the disappeared persons unit.  Much work remains, but it is a remarkable thing, especially at a time of so much challenge around the world, to see the commitment – the enduring commitment – that Colombia has made to peace and progress.</p>
<p>Last month, we saw the strength of democracy in action.  I think you had the highest turnout for the first round of presidential elections in memory.  Regardless of the results, the United States looks forward to working with the next administration to continue the progress that’s underway and the relationship that generations of our officials and our people have built together.</p>
<p>Let me just say a few words before turning it over to the president.</p>
<p>We are deepening our economic ties.  Last month marked the 10-year anniversary of the Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement that has helped double U.S. agricultural exports to Colombia, while making the United States the top importer of agricultural goods from Colombia.</p>
<p>Last week in Los Angeles, at the Summit of the Americas, President Biden announced the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.  We will work closely with countries across the region, including Colombia, to remove barriers to investment, to accelerate economic growth across our hemisphere, while ensuring that the gains of growth are more equitable – because we know that even as our economies grow, so have gaps between the rich and poor, and we’re determined to address that.</p>
<p>We’re advancing our shared security together.  Our partnership over the years has allowed U.S.  and Colombian security forces to work together.  Ambassador Pinzón and I worked on this some years ago.  We now see the benefits in the work Colombian security forces are doing to train others throughout the hemisphere.  Colombia has become an exporter of security in our hemisphere, and that matters.  The recent designation of Colombia with President Duque as a Major Non-NATO Ally will enhance this cooperation by helping our militaries work even closer together in the years ahead.</p>
<p>And this partnership, besides being a bilateral partnership, besides being a regional partnership, is increasingly a global partnership.  We’re working together on global challenges, like the climate crisis.  We see the stakes of this in Colombia’s extraordinary natural beauty, from the snow-capped mountains in Los Nevados to the tropical rain forests in the south.  We’re working together to protect these and other diverse ecosystems across the country – for example, through Amazonia Connect, also announced at the Summit of the Americas.  This initiative will work to reduce deforestation across the Amazon – the lungs of the hemisphere, and an unmatched source of biodiversity.</p>
<p>In my visit to Bogotá last year, I had a chance to talk to a group of young Colombians, who asked me about several other areas where our countries work together, from creating safe pathways for migration to promoting understanding through culture and education.</p>
<p>So I had one conversation with someone from a much younger generation – and a much more talented musical background.  (Laughter.)  Juan Carlos Mindinero is an Afro Colombian musician from Tumaco who told me about his work using music to promote peace and to address some of the most difficult issues in his community, like racism.  His work reminded me in so many ways of the songs of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, which played such a key role in inspiring and mobilizing ordinary people to act.</p>
<p>And when it comes down to it, that is really one of the most beautiful things about democracy: ordinary citizens confronting the toughest challenges that we face out in the open.  And ultimately, these dedicated citizens are what give me the most optimism for the future of the relationship between Colombia and the United States.  People who believe in the bonds between our countries, who stand ready to continue to grow them, to make their own governments and the relationship between them even better, even stronger, in the years ahead.  That’s what really drives this.</p>
<p>So let me simply say to everyone present, because in various ways virtually everyone here has been involved in this relationship, thank you for the commitment to this work.  And simply put, Mr. President, friends and colleagues, here is to the continued friendship between Colombia and the United States.  We could ask for no better partner, no better friend in the world.</p>
<p>Mr. President, over to you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT DUQUE:</strong>  Good afternoon.  It’s a great honor for me to be here at the State Department and especially at the Diplomacy Center.  Thank you so much, Secretary Blinken, for your words, for your friendship, for your permanent support to Colombia.  Susan, thank you so much for having us today.  Ambassador Pinzón, Dr. María Paula Correa.  My also special greetings to the panelists that we’re going to have this afternoon.  Maureen, thank you.  Joseph, Luis Alberto, and Marie Arana, a great writer who has written a lot about Latin America’s history.  I also want to express my salute to the former ambassadors from the United States to Colombia.  Speaker Boehner, it’s great to have you here with us.</p>
<p>And I would love to express, Mr. Secretary, that we feel very honored of this 200 years celebration.  It has been 200 years of our relationship that has been driven by values, by common purpose, and obviously by principles.  And I would like to make some references of a historical nature.  The first one is that the flag that I have behind me – yellow, blue, and red – was designed by Francisco de Miranda.  Francisco de Miranda designed that flag, and Francisco de Miranda, who has to always be considered as one of our founding fathers, was very close to General Lafayette, and he was pretty much inspired by the founding fathers of the United States.  He was approached later in time by the leaders of the Liberty Society of Caracas to come back and fight for liberty.  But before that, in 1807, Simón Bolívar departed from the Port of Cádiz and he was coming to the Americas with the idea of fighting for liberty.  But instead of going directly to La Guaira that was the common trip that he would have made, he decided to stop in Charleston.  And he remained in the United States for a few months, and it was during Thomas Jefferson’s mandate.</p>
<p>About that trip, there are no important documents about what happened to Bolívar, with the exception that he ran out of money and his brother had to send some money, finding a carrier.  But what is interesting is that years after, there was this amazing letter that Bolívar wrote to a Jamaican diplomat.  And this has been recalled also by Professor John Lynch.  And he said in the letter, “During my short stay in the United States, I tasted the flavor of liberal democracy.”  Those were major words that also inspired Bolívar.  And he fought for independence.  We got our independence in 1819.  Then he fought in the Venezuelan territory against Tomás Boves.  He finally also built the independence of Venezuela.  And then he started the southern campaign.</p>
<p>But at the time when he started the southern campaign, he called for a former Spaniard that had turned himself into a New Granadan and a Colombian, Manuel Trujillo y Torres, to be appointed as a representative to the United States of America.  He came to Washington.  He was a very clever guy.  He had this capacity to speak eloquently.  And he started knocking everybody’s doors in order to make the case for the recognition of Colombia by the United States of America.  People who knew him describe him as the Colombian Franklin.  And there are few historical records about him, and it is very common that he is always referred with that phrase.  He was a Renaissance man, and he was a very persuasive man.</p>
<p>He got to constitute a very powerful friendship with John Quincy Adams, who was the secretary of state at the time.  And he made such a strong case for the recognition that John Quincy Adams approached President Monroe, and President Monroe in 1822 signed the recognition of <em>la Gran Colombia</em>, becoming the first former Spanish colony to be recognized as a state by the United States of America.  And Manuel Trujillo y Torres was a big fan of Thomas Jefferson.  He always mentioned that that great inscription in the Declaration of Independence, to “hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,” became a mantra that also inspired the abolition of slavery in our countries.</p>
<p>Since then, this relationship has always been stronger and stronger.  And we remember always the first visit that a U.S. president did to Colombia, and it was FDR, who came to Cartagena.  Then we also remember President Kennedy’s visit to Colombia, when he launched the Alliance for Progress with his good friend, Alberto Lleras Camargo.  We remember Ronald Reagan’s visit to President Betancourt; President Bush 41, his visit to Colombia, where he also met with President Barco in the city of Cartagena.  We remember the visit that President Clinton made to Colombia.  And we also remember how, in times of despair, the United States came to us and said:  We will support you.  And that’s how Plan Colombia was built.  And I’m very glad to see here Ambassador Pickering, who was also an architect of Plan Colombia.</p>
<p>At the time when Plan Colombia was approved, Colombia was considered at the brink of becoming a failed state.  Twenty years after this policy that has been bipartisan and bicameral, Colombia has become the 37th member of the OECD.  And that just clearly speaks about how this diplomatic effort, based on values and principles, has been able to change our diplomacy.</p>
<p>And also, after Plan Colombia, President Bush 43 decided to move forward the free trade agreement between Colombia and the United States.  Speaker Boehner, we remember all the big efforts in Congress, how this also became a bipartisan, bicameral effort.  And it has opened many opportunities for us.</p>
<p>Then, during President Obama’s administration, we got strong support from the United States in multiple fronts.  We also finalized the putting in practice of the free trade agreement, and it marked a very important era for us.  I remember as president how President Trump supported us in the midst of the pandemic, and how he also supported us to face the situation of the migrants in the border zone.  And I have to express to you, Secretary Blinken, and to President Biden, my gratitude because you have saved millions of lives.  You have become the largest donor of vaccines to Colombia in the midst of this pandemic.  You have opened the accessibility of products to the United States like no other time before.  And we have been able to work on climate action, the protection of the Amazon, the protection of the migrants – and it all came together in multiple ways.</p>
<p>First, bringing our diplomatic relations to the highest peak ever by declaring Colombia a strategic non-NATO member ally, which means Colombia is today among the few countries that have that kind of recognition.  But also, being able to work along, as we did last week in Los Angeles, in two major policies: the migration declaration of L.A., which out of the complex noise that we have on permanent politics is one of the most important statements ever in a summit to describe by all ourselves that we need to treat migration with a sense of fraternity, as we have done when 1.8 million Venezuelan brothers and sisters, Ambassador Vecchio – one million already have their TPS cards in their hands.</p>
<p>And the other very important statement – the launching of the economic prosperity framework by President Biden.  This can become as important as the Alliance for Progress because it can bring investment back to the Americas, thinking on the opportunities that we have with North America; and it can be an effective deterrent of migration driven by lack of opportunities.  This will open opportunities for many Latin Americans.  And we also believe that it’s an opportunity to bring U.S. investment back in issues such as infrastructure, 5G networks, renewable energies, among many others.</p>
<p>So I consider that what we built last week was very important, and I feel proud that we were very much cohesive, the countries that participated.  And we remembered that if there were reasons why some countries were not there, it’s because in 2001, when we signed the Inter-American Democratic Charter, we also signed the Protocol of Quebec.  That protocol established that the summits are not spaces for dictatorships, and that will never be a space for dictatorships.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>So, Mr. Secretary, I feel so honored that today we’re celebrating these 200 years of this relationship in a very special day that I want to bring to your attention.  It was in June 15, 1952, that Colombian troops entered South Korea.  Colombia was the only Latin American country that participated in the Korean War, and we came with a contingent of more than 5,000 troops, which can be called – Ambassador Pinzón, who’s a military expert, has said that it could have been more than 40 percent of the Colombian army at the time.  And those soldiers came there hand by hand to participate with the United States in saving the South Korean democracy.  And no country would have done that if it wasn’t because we share those values, those objectives, and those purposes.</p>
<p>I believe that this celebration is an opportunity for keep on strengthening our ties, and we will remain the most important ally for the United States in the Western Hemisphere.  We will continue to differentiate ourselves, by embracing democracy, with autocracies – with pleasure – and we will also remain united to protect those in need, especially the migrant communities in our country that have left the horrible impact of the Maduro dictatorship.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken, you have been a friend of Colombia, you are a friend of Colombia, and I want to express my gratitude to all the diplomatic corps of the U.S. State Department here today.  You have to always see the relationship between Colombia with the United States as an example of what bipartisan, bicameral policies can do and what bipartisan diplomacy can do.  I definitely want to express to each one of you, thank you for doing so much for our country.</p>
<p>And with your permission, Secretary Blinken, I would love to close my remarks by asking Ambassador Tom Pickering to join us here to impose him the 200 years condecoration to celebrate this 200 years anniversary between Colombia and the United States for – (applause) – to an example of one of the greatest minds in U.S. diplomacy.  You have been an ambassador in many places around the world, in complex scenarios, Dr. Pickering, but as the president of Colombia, we have to thank you for being one of the brightest minds who created Plan Colombia, and we can say that because of Plan Colombia, we are today in a much better shape in a country of law and order and opportunities.</p>
<p>And I’ll finish by saying the following:  In my last four years, I have been honored with being the president of my country, fighting every day for the good of our people.  We passed a pandemic.  Out of 48 months of my administration, 30 months will be facing a pandemic.  But we’re leaving Colombia with the highest growth ever, with the lowest multidimensional poverty ever reached by Colombia, with the lowest job informality rate, being a country that delivers on an energy transition, and a country that is considered today one of the most important places for start-ups in the region.  Obviously, we still have challenges, but none of the things that we have achieved – would have not been achieved without the support of an ally such as the United States of America.</p>
<p>So Ambassador Pickering, I’m going to impose this condecoration.  I invite Secretary Blinken to join me here.</p>
<p>(A decree was read.)</p>

<p>Last month, we saw the strength of democracy in action.  I think you had the highest turnout for the first round of presidential elections in memory.  Regardless of the results, the United States looks forward to working with the next administration to continue the progress that’s underway and the relationship that generations of our officials and our people have built together.</p>
<p>Let me just say a few words before turning it over to the president.</p>
<p>We are deepening our economic ties.  Last month marked the 10-year anniversary of the Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement that has helped double U.S. agricultural exports to Colombia, while making the United States the top importer of agricultural goods from Colombia.</p>
<p>Last week in Los Angeles, at the Summit of the Americas, President Biden announced the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.  We will work closely with countries across the region, including Colombia, to remove barriers to investment, to accelerate economic growth across our hemisphere, while ensuring that the gains of growth are more equitable – because we know that even as our economies grow, so have gaps between the rich and poor, and we’re determined to address that.</p>
<p>We’re advancing our shared security together.  Our partnership over the years has allowed U.S.  and Colombian security forces to work together.  Ambassador Pinzón and I worked on this some years ago.  We now see the benefits in the work Colombian security forces are doing to train others throughout the hemisphere.  Colombia has become an exporter of security in our hemisphere, and that matters.  The recent designation of Colombia with President Duque as a Major Non-NATO Ally will enhance this cooperation by helping our militaries work even closer together in the years ahead.</p>
<p>And this partnership, besides being a bilateral partnership, besides being a regional partnership, is increasingly a global partnership.  We’re working together on global challenges, like the climate crisis.  We see the stakes of this in Colombia’s extraordinary natural beauty, from the snow-capped mountains in Los Nevados to the tropical rain forests in the south.  We’re working together to protect these and other diverse ecosystems across the country – for example, through Amazonia Connect, also announced at the Summit of the Americas.  This initiative will work to reduce deforestation across the Amazon – the lungs of the hemisphere, and an unmatched source of biodiversity.</p>
<p>In my visit to Bogotá last year, I had a chance to talk to a group of young Colombians, who asked me about several other areas where our countries work together, from creating safe pathways for migration to promoting understanding through culture and education.</p>
<p>So I had one conversation with someone from a much younger generation – and a much more talented musical background.  (Laughter.)  Juan Carlos Mindinero is an Afro Colombian musician from Tumaco who told me about his work using music to promote peace and to address some of the most difficult issues in his community, like racism.  His work reminded me in so many ways of the songs of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, which played such a key role in inspiring and mobilizing ordinary people to act.</p>
<p>And when it comes down to it, that is really one of the most beautiful things about democracy: ordinary citizens confronting the toughest challenges that we face out in the open.  And ultimately, these dedicated citizens are what give me the most optimism for the future of the relationship between Colombia and the United States.  People who believe in the bonds between our countries, who stand ready to continue to grow them, to make their own governments and the relationship between them even better, even stronger, in the years ahead.  That’s what really drives this.</p>
<p>So let me simply say to everyone present, because in various ways virtually everyone here has been involved in this relationship, thank you for the commitment to this work.  And simply put, Mr. President, friends and colleagues, here is to the continued friendship between Colombia and the United States.  We could ask for no better partner, no better friend in the world.</p>
<p>Mr. President, over to you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT DUQUE:</strong>  Good afternoon.  It’s a great honor for me to be here at the State Department and especially at the Diplomacy Center.  Thank you so much, Secretary Blinken, for your words, for your friendship, for your permanent support to Colombia.  Susan, thank you so much for having us today.  Ambassador Pinzón, Dr. María Paula Correa.  My also special greetings to the panelists that we’re going to have this afternoon.  Maureen, thank you.  Joseph, Luis Alberto, and Marie Arana, a great writer who has written a lot about Latin America’s history.  I also want to express my salute to the former ambassadors from the United States to Colombia.  Speaker Boehner, it’s great to have you here with us.</p>
<p>And I would love to express, Mr. Secretary, that we feel very honored of this 200 years celebration.  It has been 200 years of our relationship that has been driven by values, by common purpose, and obviously by principles.  And I would like to make some references of a historical nature.  The first one is that the flag that I have behind me – yellow, blue, and red – was designed by Francisco de Miranda.  Francisco de Miranda designed that flag, and Francisco de Miranda, who has to always be considered as one of our founding fathers, was very close to General Lafayette, and he was pretty much inspired by the founding fathers of the United States.  He was approached later in time by the leaders of the Liberty Society of Caracas to come back and fight for liberty.  But before that, in 1807, Simón Bolívar departed from the Port of Cádiz and he was coming to the Americas with the idea of fighting for liberty.  But instead of going directly to La Guaira that was the common trip that he would have made, he decided to stop in Charleston.  And he remained in the United States for a few months, and it was during Thomas Jefferson’s mandate.</p>
<p>About that trip, there are no important documents about what happened to Bolívar, with the exception that he ran out of money and his brother had to send some money, finding a carrier.  But what is interesting is that years after, there was this amazing letter that Bolívar wrote to a Jamaican diplomat.  And this has been recalled also by Professor John Lynch.  And he said in the letter, “During my short stay in the United States, I tasted the flavor of liberal democracy.”  Those were major words that also inspired Bolívar.  And he fought for independence.  We got our independence in 1819.  Then he fought in the Venezuelan territory against Tomás Boves.  He finally also built the independence of Venezuela.  And then he started the southern campaign.</p>
<p>But at the time when he started the southern campaign, he called for a former Spaniard that had turned himself into a New Granadan and a Colombian, Manuel Trujillo y Torres, to be appointed as a representative to the United States of America.  He came to Washington.  He was a very clever guy.  He had this capacity to speak eloquently.  And he started knocking everybody’s doors in order to make the case for the recognition of Colombia by the United States of America.  People who knew him describe him as the Colombian Franklin.  And there are few historical records about him, and it is very common that he is always referred with that phrase.  He was a Renaissance man, and he was a very persuasive man.</p>
<p>He got to constitute a very powerful friendship with John Quincy Adams, who was the secretary of state at the time.  And he made such a strong case for the recognition that John Quincy Adams approached President Monroe, and President Monroe in 1822 signed the recognition of <em>la Gran Colombia</em>, becoming the first former Spanish colony to be recognized as a state by the United States of America.  And Manuel Trujillo y Torres was a big fan of Thomas Jefferson.  He always mentioned that that great inscription in the Declaration of Independence, to “hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,” became a mantra that also inspired the abolition of slavery in our countries.</p>
<p>Since then, this relationship has always been stronger and stronger.  And we remember always the first visit that a U.S. president did to Colombia, and it was FDR, who came to Cartagena.  Then we also remember President Kennedy’s visit to Colombia, when he launched the Alliance for Progress with his good friend, Alberto Lleras Camargo.  We remember Ronald Reagan’s visit to President Betancourt; President Bush 41, his visit to Colombia, where he also met with President Barco in the city of Cartagena.  We remember the visit that President Clinton made to Colombia.  And we also remember how, in times of despair, the United States came to us and said:  We will support you.  And that’s how Plan Colombia was built.  And I’m very glad to see here Ambassador Pickering, who was also an architect of Plan Colombia.</p>
<p>At the time when Plan Colombia was approved, Colombia was considered at the brink of becoming a failed state.  Twenty years after this policy that has been bipartisan and bicameral, Colombia has become the 37th member of the OECD.  And that just clearly speaks about how this diplomatic effort, based on values and principles, has been able to change our diplomacy.</p>
<p>And also, after Plan Colombia, President Bush 43 decided to move forward the free trade agreement between Colombia and the United States.  Speaker Boehner, we remember all the big efforts in Congress, how this also became a bipartisan, bicameral effort.  And it has opened many opportunities for us.</p>
<p>Then, during President Obama’s administration, we got strong support from the United States in multiple fronts.  We also finalized the putting in practice of the free trade agreement, and it marked a very important era for us.  I remember as president how President Trump supported us in the midst of the pandemic, and how he also supported us to face the situation of the migrants in the border zone.  And I have to express to you, Secretary Blinken, and to President Biden, my gratitude because you have saved millions of lives.  You have become the largest donor of vaccines to Colombia in the midst of this pandemic.  You have opened the accessibility of products to the United States like no other time before.  And we have been able to work on climate action, the protection of the Amazon, the protection of the migrants – and it all came together in multiple ways.</p>
<p>First, bringing our diplomatic relations to the highest peak ever by declaring Colombia a strategic non-NATO member ally, which means Colombia is today among the few countries that have that kind of recognition.  But also, being able to work along, as we did last week in Los Angeles, in two major policies: the migration declaration of L.A., which out of the complex noise that we have on permanent politics is one of the most important statements ever in a summit to describe by all ourselves that we need to treat migration with a sense of fraternity, as we have done when 1.8 million Venezuelan brothers and sisters, Ambassador Vecchio – one million already have their TPS cards in their hands.</p>
<p>And the other very important statement – the launching of the economic prosperity framework by President Biden.  This can become as important as the Alliance for Progress because it can bring investment back to the Americas, thinking on the opportunities that we have with North America; and it can be an effective deterrent of migration driven by lack of opportunities.  This will open opportunities for many Latin Americans.  And we also believe that it’s an opportunity to bring U.S. investment back in issues such as infrastructure, 5G networks, renewable energies, among many others.</p>
<p>So I consider that what we built last week was very important, and I feel proud that we were very much cohesive, the countries that participated.  And we remembered that if there were reasons why some countries were not there, it’s because in 2001, when we signed the Inter-American Democratic Charter, we also signed the Protocol of Quebec.  That protocol established that the summits are not spaces for dictatorships, and that will never be a space for dictatorships.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>So, Mr. Secretary, I feel so honored that today we’re celebrating these 200 years of this relationship in a very special day that I want to bring to your attention.  It was in June 15, 1952, that Colombian troops entered South Korea.  Colombia was the only Latin American country that participated in the Korean War, and we came with a contingent of more than 5,000 troops, which can be called – Ambassador Pinzón, who’s a military expert, has said that it could have been more than 40 percent of the Colombian army at the time.  And those soldiers came there hand by hand to participate with the United States in saving the South Korean democracy.  And no country would have done that if it wasn’t because we share those values, those objectives, and those purposes.</p>
<p>I believe that this celebration is an opportunity for keep on strengthening our ties, and we will remain the most important ally for the United States in the Western Hemisphere.  We will continue to differentiate ourselves, by embracing democracy, with autocracies – with pleasure – and we will also remain united to protect those in need, especially the migrant communities in our country that have left the horrible impact of the Maduro dictatorship.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken, you have been a friend of Colombia, you are a friend of Colombia, and I want to express my gratitude to all the diplomatic corps of the U.S. State Department here today.  You have to always see the relationship between Colombia with the United States as an example of what bipartisan, bicameral policies can do and what bipartisan diplomacy can do.  I definitely want to express to each one of you, thank you for doing so much for our country.</p>
<p>And with your permission, Secretary Blinken, I would love to close my remarks by asking Ambassador Tom Pickering to join us here to impose him the 200 years condecoration to celebrate this 200 years anniversary between Colombia and the United States for – (applause) – to an example of one of the greatest minds in U.S. diplomacy.  You have been an ambassador in many places around the world, in complex scenarios, Dr. Pickering, but as the president of Colombia, we have to thank you for being one of the brightest minds who created Plan Colombia, and we can say that because of Plan Colombia, we are today in a much better shape in a country of law and order and opportunities.</p>
<p>And I’ll finish by saying the following:  In my last four years, I have been honored with being the president of my country, fighting every day for the good of our people.  We passed a pandemic.  Out of 48 months of my administration, 30 months will be facing a pandemic.  But we’re leaving Colombia with the highest growth ever, with the lowest multidimensional poverty ever reached by Colombia, with the lowest job informality rate, being a country that delivers on an energy transition, and a country that is considered today one of the most important places for start-ups in the region.  Obviously, we still have challenges, but none of the things that we have achieved – would have not been achieved without the support of an ally such as the United States of America.</p>
<p>So Ambassador Pickering, I’m going to impose this condecoration.  I invite Secretary Blinken to join me here.</p>
<p>(A decree was read.)</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of State renewed the Charter of the Cultural Property Advisory Committee.  The Committee was established by the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (Public Law 97-446) to provide recommendations regarding requests for assistance from foreign governments under the UNESCO 1970 <i>Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property</i>.</p>
<p>The Committee carries out investigation and review of foreign government requests and provides recommendations to the State Department regarding agreements or emergency actions that create import restrictions on designated archaeological and/or ethnological material.  The Committee also undertakes continuing review of the effectiveness of cultural property agreements and emergency actions.</p>

		<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>Loy Henderson Auditorium</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Good afternoon, everyone.  Good to see you all here.  When I heard everyone was gathering here, I thought the least I could do is drop by to simply say thank you, thank you, thank you for the remarkable work that you’re doing.</p>
<p>You all know this, but four months ago our countries created the Global Action Plan to try to accelerate our efforts to vaccinate 70 percent of our people against COVID-19, the goal set by the WHO.  I think we all knew that hitting that target would take countries stepping up together in a highly coordinated way.  So we identified key gaps that remained, we established together six lines of effort to bridge those gaps, and then everyone in this room in effect took responsibility for leading this effort and doing it together.</p>
<p>And as we’ve talked, and I know as you’re discussing today, we have made significant progress on each of these lines of effort.  A lot more work remains to be done, but this is moving forward precisely because we’ve come together in a coordinated way.</p>
<p>The first line of effort: trying to get more shots into arms.  We know that there are a lot of vaccines out there.  The challenge has been actually getting the shots into arms.  We’ve ramped up vaccine delivery.  We’ve improved cold chain capacity to store and ship more doses to more places.  We’ve conducted in-country campaigns to increase demand for vaccines.</p>
<p>For example, just to cite a few:  Colombia has stepped up its efforts to vaccinate Venezuelan refugees; India has enhanced its vaccine production; Japan has significantly expanded cold chain storage worldwide; Australia, New Zealand are doing great work vaccinating citizens in the Pacific Island nations, just to cite some of the striking examples.</p>
<p>To that end, one of the things I’m excited to be able to share today is that the United States, in partnership with COVAX, will begin donating pediatric Pfizer vaccines for 5-to-12 year-olds.  In fact, the first shipment is going out today:  300,000 doses are being donated to Mongolia; 2.2 million doses are being donated to Nepal.  We’ve got many more ready to go for countries that want them.</p>
<p>The second line of effort that we’ve all been working on together: strengthening supply chains for COVID-related materials – tests, syringes, treatments.  Well, we are building resilience into the supply chains when shortages and disruptions emerge.  For example, the European Union has been consulting with businesses across Africa on medical supplies.  The United States has started similar engagements in our own hemisphere as well as globally.</p>
<p>The third line of effort: addressing information gaps that lead to low confidence in vaccines. With help from Canada, we’re coordinating across governments to combat misinformation and disinformation, as well as through programs like the United States Global VAX effort, which uses evidence-based interventions to increase vaccine demand.</p>
<p>The fourth line of effort that we’ve been working together: providing more support to frontline health care workers.  Well, with leadership from Spain, from India, the Republic of Korea, we’re ensuring that those workers have access to vaccines as well as accurate information about vaccines so that they can stay healthy and keep doing the heroic work that they’re doing every day.</p>
<p>The fifth line of effort:  We’ve begun a critical conversation on how to increase access to treatments and therapeutics so that people who get COVID can survive it and bounce back faster.   There’s a lot more work we’ll need to do on this line of effort to ensure that we have enough interventions available worldwide, from testing to treating, as we move to the next phase of the pandemic.</p>
<p>And finally, the sixth line of effort: building a stronger, more effective global health architecture so that we can better detect, prevent, respond to future emergencies.  Well, we started by building on the work of the structures that we created to address this pandemic – COVAX, the ACT-Accelerator.  And I particularly want to thank Norway and South Africa for coordinating the ACT-A’s work to develop and equitably distribute tests, treatments, vaccines; Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan for galvanizing donors; Indonesia for creating a financial intermediary fund for pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>I know that we all agree around this table and in this room that if we’re just as vulnerable at the end of this pandemic as we were when COVID-19 began, that’s dangerous and it’s a major disservice to our citizens.  We have to seize this opportunity to become better prepared than we were before.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the lines of effort that we’re all working, the six lines of effort, remain critical.  In many ways this is a marathon.  We still have a long way to go if we’re going to end the acute phase of the pandemic and build a lasting foundation for our future.</p>
<p>To do that, perhaps more than anything else, we have to maintain our commitment.  We can’t let the pandemic and pandemic fatigue deplete our political will.  And I just want to assure you all that the United States continues to be intently focused on fighting the pandemic and leaving the world better prepared and better defended for whatever comes next.</p>
<p>This experience, this pandemic, has taught us that health security is national security – and that in this 21st century, health emergencies often can’t be solved by countries working on their own.  Viruses don’t respect borders.  We are, quite literally, all in this together.  And so I’m really grateful to everyone here, to the countries you represent, for this partnership.  The progress we’ve made to date has been possible because of your leadership, because of your engagement, because of your willingness to coordinate and collaborate to what I think is a remarkable degree.  Now we just need to keep doing it.</p>
<p>So thank you.  I hope the meetings here in Washington are productive, I hope they’re energizing, and I look forward to seeing everyone again soon to review our progress, strengthen our efforts, and keep up this common fight.  Thank you very, very much.  (Applause.)</p>

		<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. government remains deeply concerned about the evolving racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist (REMVE) threat worldwide.  An element of it entails violent white supremacists traveling internationally to train and fight with likeminded individuals.  As part of our efforts to counter this threat, the Department of State is designating Anton Thulin as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) pursuant to Executive order (E.O.) 13224, as amended, for posing a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Department of the Treasury is designating, under E.O. 13244, Stanislav Shevchuk for acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM); and Alexander Zhuchovsky for materially assisting, sponsoring, or providing financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, RIM.</p>
<p>RIM, which was designated by the Department of State as an SDGT in 2020, is an ultranationalist, white supremacist group based in Russia that provides paramilitary-style training to white supremacists and neo-Nazis and plays a prominent role in attempting to rally Europeans and Americans into a common front against perceived enemies.</p>
<p>In 2016, Anton Thulin, a Swedish citizen, traveled to St. Petersburg and received paramilitary training from RIM, including in bomb-making.  In 2017, a Swedish court convicted Thulin and sentenced him to 22 months in prison in connection with the detection of a powerful homemade bomb near a refugee residential center in Gothenburg, Sweden.  After serving his sentence, Thulin sought to receive additional paramilitary training in Poland, before he was expelled by Polish authorities who cited the “serious, real, and current threat to security and public order” he posed.</p>
<p>The United States is designating Anton Thulin because his continued pursuit of terrorist training, even after serving his prison sentence for his role in the 2017 attack in Sweden, demonstrates that he continues to pose a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>As a result of these actions, U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with those designated today.  Their property and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked.  Terrorist designations expose and isolate entities and individuals and prevent them from exploiting the U.S. financial system.  Moreover, designations can assist the law enforcement activities of U.S. agencies and other relevant enforcement entities and governments.</p>

		<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, DC</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary Blinken, thank you very much for joining us.  Let’s start with Ukraine.  We know from what the Ukrainians themselves are saying, what the reporting is, that they are now being massively outgunned by the Russians.  They say their weapons are not being replaced quickly enough or adequately; they don’t have close to the amount of weapons and ammunition they need.  The tide has turned in Russia’s favor?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  No, I think, Judy, what we’re seeing is a very intense fight in the Donbas, in eastern and also in southern Ukraine.  There are significant causalities on both sides.  It’s horrific, and it’s the result of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.  There is a very intense effort that is ongoing as we speak to make sure that the Ukrainians are getting what they need, when they need it, to deal with the Russian aggression.  And it’s not going to be linear.  There are, tragically, ups and downs in this.  And again, there are significant causalities on both sides.  But there is a very, very significantly coordinated effort being undertaken to make sure that the Ukrainians get what they need when they need it, and that will continue.</p>
<p>We’ve said for some time that, unfortunately, this is likely to go on for some time, and this is what we’re seeing on the ground.  But there’s a big difference.  The Ukrainians are fighting for their country; they’re fighting for their future; they’re fighting for their freedom.  It’s unclear what the Russians are fighting for, except to advance the whims of Vladimir Putin and the bizarre belief that Ukraine is not a sovereign, independent country and needs to be subsumed somehow into Russia.  So I am convinced and confident that, at the end of the day, Ukraine’s independence, Ukraine’s sovereignty will prevail and will be there long after Vladimir Putin has left the scene.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, there is terrible death, there’s terrible discussion, and that’s the result of Russia’s aggression.  We are determined that Ukraine get what it needs to deal with this aggression and ultimately to have a strong hand at any negotiating table that emerges.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And right now, though, the Ukrainians say they are not getting what they need.  What more can the U.S. do right now to help them?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Judy, it’s literally happening as we speak.  Some weeks ago Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin put together a group of about 40 countries in Ramstein, Germany, to make sure that all of the assistance that Ukraine needs is being actively coordinated and getting in.  That group of countries is working every single day to make sure it’s happening.</p>
<p>But of course, there’s tremendous suffering on the front lines, on the battlefield.  The Ukrainians are feeling that; they’re suffering from that.  We’re deeply concerned by it, but we’re also working 24/7 to make sure that they get what they need.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Well, what we’re hearing from experts, though, at the same time, is no matter how unfair or repugnant it may seem, that it is now appearing inevitable that Ukraine is going to have to make territorial concessions in the east.  Is that what you see, that they are going to have to bow to Vladimir Putin and give him that territory that he says he wants?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Judy, Ukraine’s future is up to the Ukrainians.  It’s up to the Ukrainian people and, ultimately, those decisions will be made by its democratically elected government, including President Zelenskyy.  He will have to determine what’s in the best interests of his country, of his people, and we’ll support that.  We’re not going to be less Ukrainian than the Ukrainians; we’re not going to be more Ukrainian than the Ukrainians.  But it is fundamentally up to them.  And that’s ultimately what this is about.  Vladimir Putin is trying to take away from Ukrainians the right to determine their own future.  We strongly support that right and we’ll look to the Ukrainians to decide what’s in their best interest.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Let me turn to the Middle East, Mr. Secretary.  President Biden’s July trip to the region announced today, including a stop in Saudi Arabia and a meeting with the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who U.S. intelligence, as you know, has said had a role – masterminded the murder and the dismemberment of <em>Washington Post</em> journalist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi.  The President had called the crown prince a pariah and said that any meeting would be antithetical to what America stands for.  He’s now done a 180.  How is this not a triumph of oil and energy over values and human rights?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I think the President spoke to this the other day when he made very clear that human rights remains central to our foreign policy, as well as our obligation to advance American interests and American values.  And when it comes to Saudi Arabia, there are a lot of different things at play.  This has been a longstanding partner for the United States, over decades, generations, a vital partner in dealing with extremism, in contending with the challenge posed by Iran.  We have about 70,000 Americans in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>At the same time, when we came in, the President made clear that we were determined to recalibrate the relationship – not rupture it, recalibrate it, to make sure that it better reflected our interests and our values.  When it comes to Khashoggi, when it comes to the – his murder, one of the earliest things that we did was to release the full report on what happened, including assessing blame for and responsibility for the murder, with the full imprimatur of the U.S. Government, a report that I released.  We instituted the Khashoggi Ban to try to make sure that countries that sought to repress critics in other countries would pay a price for doing that, and we’ve actually used the Khashoggi Ban more than 70 times now.</p>
<p>So we’ve been very clear about both responsibility and accountability for the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.  At the same time, we have a lot of – we have other values at stake.  One of them is making sure that one of the worst wars that we’ve seen in the last decade, one of the worst humanitarian situations in the world, in Yemen, that that war comes to an end.  Saudi Arabia has been indispensable in helping us to achieve something that many have not taken much note of, but is hugely important.  We have a truce now in Yemen, the first one in eight years, and it’s now been extended for its ninth week. That’s a lot of humanitarian assistance to get to people who hadn’t been getting it for years. Some of the guns have stopped firing.  And as a result, we also have an opportunity – fragile – to get something sustainable and to really build an enduring peace in Yemen.  That advances our interests, it also advances our values, and Saudi Arabia is critical to that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Well, in this meeting, will the President confront the crown prince on the Khashoggi murder?  And if not, why not?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, I’m not going to get ahead of what’s going to happen in Saudi Arabia, but I can say this – and again, the President’s been very clear – human rights will remain at the heart of our agenda, along with the other interests and values that we’re trying to advance.  In my own conversations with Saudi counterparts and Saudi officials, I regularly raise human rights, including individual cases and more systemic challenges that continue to be posed in Saudi Arabia.  I would expect the President to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And one other follow-up there:  In return for the U.S. reprieve on this, it’s been reported that the Saudis agreed to increase oil production.  Is this the case?  And if so, how long do you expect that to continue?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Energy is one of the issues that we talk about with Saudi Arabia, along with everything else that I just mentioned, whether it’s Yemen, whether it’s dealing with extremism, whether it’s contending with Iran, whether it’s building greater regional integration.  We’ve seen remarkable things happen in the last few years in bringing countries in the region closer together, including Israel, and that, I’m sure, will be a topic as well.  But we will engage the Saudis on energy as we have for years, especially at a time when we want to make sure that there’s more energy on the markets and that ultimately prices come down.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Let me turn you quickly to China.  There are growing opinions out there, including retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis, saying that it’s less likely, they believe, that China would attack Taiwan now, watching what Vladimir Putin is experiencing in Ukraine and also with a look ahead to the 20th Party Congress later this year.  Do you agree that it’s less likely that China’s going to move on Taiwan right now – anytime soon?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Judy, I can’t speculate on what China will do or won’t do.  And ultimately, what we’re doing is to try to shape the environment in which they’re acting so that that may have an influence on what – on their decisions.  But when it comes to Taiwan, we’ve had a longstanding policy that hasn’t changed.  There was a status quo that existed, and we’ve been determined to see that no one unilaterally moves to change that status quo.  Unfortunately, what we’ve seen over the last 10 years is China acting more repressively at home and more aggressively abroad, to include actions that it’s taken with regard to Taiwan that are potentially dangerous and destabilizing.</p>
<p>China has to make those calculations; we can’t make it for them.  But what we can do, as I said, is to shape the environment.  One of the things I think that China has to factor into any calculus is the response that we’ve seen to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, and so many countries coming together to stand against that aggression, both by making sure that Ukraine had the support that it needed and also making sure that Russia paid a price for the aggression.  That’s something that I think China has to look at as it thinks about the future.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Two quick follow-ups to that.  One, if China were to attack Taiwan, would the U.S. militarily come to Taiwan’s defense?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>We’ve been very clear that our commitment to help Taiwan defend itself continues and will be sustained.  We’re committed to, as we’ve said many times, our “one China” policy, but also the Taiwan Relations Act and our responsibilities under the Taiwan Relations Act to make sure that Taiwan has the means to effectively defend itself and ultimately, preferably, to deter any aggression.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And a final question on Iran.  Now that they have turned off most of the cameras monitoring their nuclear activity, does that mean the prospects for a deal with Iran over its nuclear program and the U.S. are dead?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>It certainly makes it even more difficult than it already is.  But the fact is, Judy, that we’ve spent a lot of time with our European partners, with China – with Russia, even – over the last year seeking to get back into compliance with the so-called JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal.  Much of that work on the deal itself has been done.  And unfortunately – more than unfortunately – as you know, in pulling out of the deal, and then in Iran taking steps to restart its nuclear program, we’ve seen terrible results because the breakout time that Iran had under the deal – that is, the time it would take to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon – has moved from one year when the agreement was enforced to a matter of weeks or less right now.</p>
<p>But the details are there if Iran chooses to move forward in getting back into compliance.  What’s happened is that Iran has basically sought to insert extraneous issues into this negotiation that had nothing to do with the JCPOA.  It’s also taken actions like the one you cited in starting to remove cameras from facilities that would make it increasingly difficult to get back into the JCPOA, because those cameras are necessary for verifying the agreement.  This agreement had probably the most effective and intrusive inspections and monitoring regime of any arms control agreement.  If Iran is taking those pieces apart as well, it’s just going to make it more difficult to get back into compliance.</p>
<p>So again, this is up to Iran.  It has the ability if it chooses – if it stops trying to insert extraneous issues, if it stops trying to take down these cameras, then there’s still the possibility of getting back into the agreement, which would advance our security, our interests, as well as those of our allies and partners.  But the course it’s on right now is moving in the other direction.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Secretary Antony Blinken, thank you very much.  A lot on your plate.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Good to be with you, Judy.  Thank you.</p>

<p>So again, this is up to Iran.  It has the ability if it chooses – if it stops trying to insert extraneous issues, if it stops trying to take down these cameras, then there’s still the possibility of getting back into the agreement, which would advance our security, our interests, as well as those of our allies and partners.  But the course it’s on right now is moving in the other direction.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Secretary Antony Blinken, thank you very much.  A lot on your plate.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Good to be with you, Judy.  Thank you.</p>

		<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Washington, DC</p>
<p>2:24 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-DEPARTMENT"></a><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Just a couple things at the top. First, we are very pleased to welcome today five journalists visiting us from Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. These journalists are here part of the Vaclav Havel Journalism Fellowship, a unique joint initiative between RFE/RL and the Czech Republic for aspiring journalists in support of pluralism, press freedom, and media independence everywhere. Welcome to you all. Welcome to the State Department.</p>
<p>And before we begin, allow me just a moment of personal privilege. And I need to stop making a habit out of this, but we have another very sad departure from my team. JT Ice, who has served as our deputy spox for the past two-plus years, just over two years, having started in June of 2020, will be moving on today. Today is his final day, I am very sad to say. JT, as you all know, is a career member of the Foreign Service. He has had a storied career overseas, here as well, and his tenure on the spokesperson’s team across these two administrations has been a fine example of that.</p>
<p>I met JT on January 20th around 8:30 in the morning or so, and he’s been by my side ever since. I could not have done the job without him, without his expertise, without his experience, without his wise counsel at every step of the way. So JT will be sorely missed, not only by me but everyone in the bureau, everyone on my team, and many, many people in this department. Of course, he’s not going far. He is going to the very pleasant confines of the Naval War College for a tour there before he continues with his next adventure in the Foreign Service.</p>
<p>So JT, thank you. And with that, turn to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks, Ned. Welcome back. And JT, have fun in Rhode Island. I hope they’re ready for you there.</p>
<p>Can I just very briefly – is something wrong with the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I think the floor is yours.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-RUSSIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> There was – there was an echo. Before we – I just want to ask very briefly if you’re aware of Brittney Griner’s detention being extended by the Russians.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So I’ve seen those reports. I’ve seen the reports emanate from Russia that her detention has been extended. Our position for some time on this has been very clear: Brittney Griner should not be detained. She should not be detained for a single day longer. We have characterized her, we have characterized Paul Whelan, who has also spent far too long in Russian detention, as wrongful detainees. The team here, individuals around the world, are working around the clock to secure and to effect their safe and prompt release and also the safe and prompt release of wrongful American detainees around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But were you aware – was the embassy aware that there was a hearing or that this was a possibility today? Was there an actual hearing that anyone was able to go to?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> My understanding is that we became aware through TASS.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So nothing?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I was &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And subsequent to the TASS report, have you been able to confirm with Russian authorities that this is, in fact, the case?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> To confirm that her detention has been extended?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Look, we are in constant contact regarding her case. We are in constant contact with her team and her network back here at home. I think you all have seen that yesterday representatives of the department, representatives of the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, and a senior representative from our Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs met with the Phoenix Mercury, as they are here, so we are regularly keeping them apprised of her case.</p>
<p>We were last able to have consular access to Brittney Griner last month. We continue to press for regular, continued access to all American detainees who are in pretrial detention, whether they are unjustly detained, as is Brittney Griner, or whether they are facing criminal charges. This is a case that we are working assiduously behind the scenes. We’ve been in regular contact with Russian authorities regarding it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Well, I mean, is it problematic for you? Are you going to complain to the Russians that you were given no &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, of course it’s problematic. Her detention &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, no. Well, I get &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Her &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I get the entire detention is &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let’s leave aside – let’s leave aside &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. But what happened today – right, I get that the entire thing is problematic for you. I understand that. But I’m talking about specifically what happened today, the fact that you learned about it from a state news agency and there was no apparent – no notification to the embassy or the consular officials there. Is that in particular a problem for you?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t want to speak for the embassy and whether they had any contact prior to this. I can tell you that everyone I’ve spoken to learned of it today from the news reports. But to your question, absolutely this is problematic. This case is problematic from top to bottom. It is precisely why we have characterized Brittney Griner as a wrongful detainee. It’s precisely why we are doing everything we can to see and to effect her prompt release from Russian detention.</p>
<p>Yes, Francesco.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, also on Russian detainees, do you have any comment on Navalny being transferred to a more strict colony and his lawyers saying they don’t know where exactly he is?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, similarly, we’ve seen these reports that Aleksey Navalny has been transferred from the penal colony where he has been in prison and that his current whereabouts are unknown. We call on Russian authorities to allow Mr. Navalny access to his lawyers, to his legal representation, as well as to receive medical care. We have communicated to the Russian Government repeatedly that they are responsible for what happens to Mr. Navalny as he is in their custody. They will be held accountable by the international community were anything to befall Mr. Navalny while he is in their custody.</p>
<p>His exposure over many years of this government’s corruption and his pro-democracy activism prompted this politically motivated arrest. We have urged authorities to take all necessary action to ensure his safety and good health, and we reiterate our call for his immediate release, as well as an end to the persecution of his many supporters.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You have communicated that to the Russian Government even after February 24th?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We have communicated this to the Russian Government previously, and I am confident that we will be in a position to reiterate that message soon.</p>
<p>Yes, Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On U.S. detainees, how many are in pretrial detention right now in Russia?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So this is a figure, especially in a country as large as Russia, that is constantly changing. It doesn’t do us any good to release a particular figure on any given day. There are cases where Americans are detained and subsequently released in short order; there are cases where Americans are detained and are held for far too long, as is the case with Brittney Griner, as is the case with Paul Whelan, as was the case with Trevor Reed. So we are working and making the point relentlessly to our Russian counterparts that, consistent with their obligations under the Vienna Convention, consistent with their obligations under our bilateral arrangements, we expect to have regular access to Americans who are held in pretrial detention.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And when was the last time the embassy had access to Paul Whelan?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’ll get you the updated date there, but it was – we’ll get you the updated date.</p>
<p>Yes, over here.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-IRAN"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can we switch to Iran?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Iranian foreign minister has said that they put forward a new proposal to revive the JCPOA. Is that true, and if so, when did they make this proposal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> As we and our European partners have made clear, we are prepared to immediately conclude and implement the deal we negotiated in Vienna, the deal that has been on the table for a number of months now for a mutual return to full compliance with the JCPOA. But for that to happen, Tehran needs to decide to drop demands that go beyond the scope of the JCPOA, needs to decide to drop issues that are extraneous to the JCPOA.</p>
<p>We have made very clear where we are. We believe that if Iran makes this political decision, we’ll be in a position to conclude and to pursue a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA very swiftly. If Iran does not do that, it will further imperil the odds that we will ever be able to reach a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But has Iran put a new proposal forward?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We have been in regular indirect contact via the European Union, so we’re not going to speak to the specifics – specific dynamics of this diplomacy other than to say that Enrique Mora has been – has served as an important go-between role, and we await a constructive response from the Iranians, a response that leaves behind issues that are extraneous to the JCPOA.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So, Ned, you’re saying “extraneous.” What are the extraneous things that they are asking? Can you explain, please?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Extraneous in this case means something that is not a part – should not be a part of the JCPOA.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I know perfectly well what it means. I’m just saying, what are these things?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Look, I’m not going to get into the diplomacy. I’m not going to speak to proposals that the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Is it something akin to the Iranians maybe demanding some sort of a guarantee that you will not have a new administration nullifying whatever deal you arrive at? Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> On that, Said – yeah, fancy, huh. On that, Said, we have made very clear to the Iranians – we did this in October of last year when the President met with our European – with his European counterparts in Rome on the sidelines of the G20. And if you take a close look at the readout that emanated from that meeting, we made very clear that our intention is and was – was and is – to effect a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA and that we intend to remain there, in so long as Iran would live up to its end of the deal. It would serve us no purpose to achieve a mutual return to compliance only to scrap it down the line.</p>
<p>Now, beyond that, I’m not going to speak to proposals that have been sent back and forth, other than to say we are prepared to re-enter the JCPOA on a mutual basis. That is to say, if Iran decides that it is willing to reimpose the nuclear restrictions that the JCPOA calls for, we are willing to do what is necessary in terms of sanctions lifting on our end to once again be in compliance with the JCPOA. That choice is now Iran’s. It has been Iran’s for some time. There has been a deal that has been on the table in Vienna for a number of months now. It is a deal that is still in our national security interest, because it is a deal that conveys nonproliferation advantages that are – that go beyond what we have now.</p>
<p>And what we have now – the urgency that we have now and the challenge that we face – is that, given the advancements Iran has been able to make to its nuclear program since May of 2018, when the last administration abandoned the nuclear deal, a nuclear deal that – with which Iran was in full compliance, by the way – Iran has advanced its nuclear programs in ways that are profoundly dangerous and that are profoundly corrosive to the global nonproliferation regime. We went from a breakout time that upon implementation of the JCPOA that was out at about 12 months, it is a breakout time that is now measured in weeks or less. To us, that is unacceptable. That is why we continue to pursue a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA. We will do that for as long as the deal that’s on the table conveys benefits that the present moment, in terms of Iran’s nuclear program, does not.</p>
<p>Michel.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, until when will you keep talking to the Iranians? And second, on the deterrence front, is the U.S. trying to form a coalition in the region that includes Israel and Arab countries to counter the Iranian influence?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So on the first part of your question, as you know, we’re not talking directly to the Iranians. As we’ve said before, we would prefer that. It would make the business of diplomacy much simpler. It would allow us to address complex and multifaceted issues in a more effective way. But of course, the Iranians have not been willing to do that, and so, as I mentioned a moment ago, we have been going through the – our European partners and allies to convey these messages.</p>
<p>In terms of the timeframe – and what I just said is the core point – we will continue to pursue a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA for as long as doing so is in our national interest. And right now, a mutual return to the JCPOA would convey nonproliferation benefits that we don’t have at the present moment. Again, the fact is that Iran’s breakout time is dangerously low at the present. It has dwindled by months and months since Iran began distancing itself from the stringent requirements of the JCPOA in mid-2018.</p>
<p>We are constantly looking at the nonproliferation benefits that a mutual return to compliance would convey versus what we have now. Every week, every day that this goes on, those benefits are eroded. So we will reach a point where a mutual return to compliance is no longer in our interest. Even if we wanted to, that’s not – almost certainly not a date that I could give you right now because it is based on an assessment of where Iran’s program is. It is based on an assessment of what a mutual return to compliance would convey in terms of a resulting breakout time, and that’s an assessment that experts here, experts in our Intelligence Community and elsewhere, are constantly refining to determine what’s in our national interest.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On the second question?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And you expect – and you would expect Rob Malley and Brett McGurk, when they go up to the Hill for this closed hearing before SFRC tomorrow, to make the same case that it is still – that the administration still assesses that it is in the U.S. national interest to return to compliance?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It is the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Because if that’s going to be their message, it’s going to be a long meeting and not a very pleasant one for them.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I can’t speak to the reaction that we’ll hear from the Hill, other than to say that we regularly engage with our counterparts on Capitol Hill. As you know, Matt, it was just last month that Rob Malley spent several hours in an open hearing before lawmakers.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, but this one is closed, which means that it might – well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, and &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; I suppose maybe there might – that there might be less, like, public performance, but &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, the message you heard from Rob when he was before lawmakers last month is consistent with where we are now, and Rob made the case &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. So then what’s the point of going up there to do this classified briefing if your position is still the same?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The point of going up there is that we want to ensure that we keep lawmakers fully and presently informed of what it is that we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Since the appearance last month, there has been this IAEA report; there has been the Board of Governors resolution. So things have changed.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Of course. And I am confident that every time we speak to lawmakers that they will pose those questions and that we will offer those answers.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-ISRAEL"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So realistically, if the President goes to Israel, let’s say around the 15th of July and so on, as planned or scheduled, before arriving at a – or returning back to this deal, is it likely that it’s dead in the water and then would you – would it be dead by then?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Again, we’re not going to put a timeframe on it, largely because we can’t. It is a &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> If the trip is made before a deal is &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It is an assessment. It is an assessment that is evolving as Iran’s nuclear program advances. And if Iran continues to make these advances, if it continues to spin advanced centrifuges, if it continues to blow beyond limits to its stockpile, this is a deal that, before too long, will not convey the nonproliferation benefits that we would need it to convey if we were to pursue it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, you didn’t answer my second question.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Oh. On the – look, the – we are – and you’ve heard from – this from us before, consistently, and again today with the announcement of the President’s travel to Israel, but our commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad. And we, in cooperation with our allies and regional partners, including Israel, we will use every appropriate tool at our disposal to confront the IRGC’s destabilizing influence in the region. You’ve seen evidence of that with the financial sanctions that we’ve imposed. We continue to coordinate closely with our Israeli partners on this, with our Gulf partners, with our – with other partners throughout the Middle East. And I have no doubt that the challenge that Iran poses to the region and beyond will be high on the agenda when President Biden is in Israel next month and when he is in Saudi Arabia next month meeting with the GCC and meeting with his Saudi partners as well.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So on the trip &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let me move around &#8212;</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-SAUDI"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But since you are on the trip, what has changed, meaning – I mean, the President when he was running for office, he called Saudi Arabia a pariah and so on. What has changed since then that Saudi Arabia is recognized, as it is has always been, as a major partner of the United States?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Said, this is a President as – who, of course, will not hesitate when we have an opportunity to engage in a way that advances America’s interests and in a way that is consistent with our values. I can tell you what hasn’t changed, and President Biden actually said this just the other week. He said, “I’m not going to change my view on human rights.” So in every relationship, of course, we bring our values with us, and human rights is always on the agenda. Human rights is always on the table. So, too, are the interests of the American people. And these two things can be – and I would say must be – complementary.</p>
<p>When it comes to Saudi Arabia, this is a relationship where a multiplicity of interests are at play. Of course, there is the issue of extremism, of terrorism. We have worked side-by-side with our Saudi partners for years on this scourge, combatting it. There’s the issue of Yemen, and just the other week there was an extension of the truce in Yemen, a truce that is now in its ninth week, a truce that has allowed humanitarian access to parts of Yemen that have been bereft of aid and humanitarian assistance for far too long.</p>
<p>One of the first appointments from this administration was when President Biden came here early on. It was maybe the second week of the administration, and we made public our appointment of Tim Lenderking as a special envoy for Yemen. Over the course of these past 15 or so months, Special Envoy Lenderking and his team have worked assiduously with partners around the world, including the UN, now UN Special Envoy Hans Grundberg, but also with partners in the Gulf and principally with our Saudi partners. Saudi Arabia was pivotal to getting to that humanitarian ceasefire and indispensable to extending it just the other week.</p>
<p>This is not only about a civil war in Yemen, which of course is a cause of great concern for the United States, both the violence, the instability, and the humanitarian implications, but this is also about our direct interests, our core interests, the number – hundreds – of cross-border attacks have emanated from Yemen in recent years. Of course, that is of concern to us for the threat that it poses to Saudi Arabia, but it’s also of concern to us because there are 70,000 Americans in the kingdom.</p>
<p>Beyond Yemen, there is the question of regional stability. There is the question of healing regional rifts, regional divides within the Gulf, within Lebanon. Saudi Arabia has been a partner on that as well. We’ve talked about the challenge that Iran poses. Not only are we working with Israel, we are working closely with our Gulf partners, including the Saudis, and the broader GCC, by the way, the GCC+3, which will be in Saudi Arabia when President Biden visits there.</p>
<p>There are also other interests, including energy, and we’ve spoken of our desire to see a steady global supply of energy. This has been a topic of discussion on a bilateral basis with members of OPEC. It will be on the agenda when President Biden meets with the GCC and meets with Saudi counterparts in Saudi Arabia next month as well.</p>
<p>So I think you can see the line through all of this is doing whatever we can to pursue America’s interests while not leaving by the wayside our values. And one of the first things that we did, one of the first marquee events – I believe it might have been his second visit down to this very room – Secretary Blinken came down, released the Khashoggi report, a report that was compiled under the previous administration, released it with the full imprimatur of the U.S. Government; in a powerful signal, and a signal of our commitment to human rights, our prioritization of human rights, announced the Khashoggi Ban.</p>
<p>We’ve implemented the Khashoggi Ban dozens of times. We’ve sanctioned the quick reaction force. We’ve taken measures to hold accountable those who have committed grave human rights abuses, and we’ll continue to do that. But we can have human rights at the center of our foreign policy, as they have been, as we continue to pursue the interests of the American people across all of these interests and the many other interests that we have and that we share with our Saudi partners.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-MIDDLEEAST"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Following up on Michel’s question about the military defense system probably in the Middle East, I think he spoke generally, including the Arab countries of the region. You addressed Israel, but does the same policy apply towards the Arab countries of the region? And don’t you think – and last week, late last week, there was a bipartisan legislation both in the House and the Senate to arm – to bolster the military or defense capabilities of these countries vis-à-vis Iran. Wouldn’t that just aggravate things in the region and probably cause Iran to react in a more even – more disturbing way?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, the shared interests that I mentioned a moment ago that we have with our Saudi partners, we have with the full array of our Gulf partners, and that is why we see this as an important moment to have high-level engagement with the GCC, with the GCC+3 in this case, because Iran does pose a challenge to the broader region. It’s also why Rob Malley and his team, not only have they regularly updated our Israeli partners on the progress, or in some cases – in most cases – lack thereof with regard to a potential mutual return to compliance, but Rob has briefed the GCC. And late last year, there was a statement put out by the GCC indicating their support for the prospect of a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA, because these countries know the challenge that Iran poses. They know the nonproliferation benefits that a potential return to compliance with the JCPOA would convey not only for us, but also an arrangement that would have – that would redound positively to their national security interest.</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is yes, we work cooperatively not only with Israel, but our other partners in the Gulf on the challenge that Iran poses.</p>
<p>To the second part of your question, everything we’re doing is defensive in nature. Iran – it is Iran that is funding proxies. It is Iran that is fueling instability. It is Iran that is providing support to bad actors in places like Yemen and Syria and elsewhere. And it’s Iran that is supporting terrorist groups. So everything we are doing is with an eye to counteract the malign influence that Iran is in many cases exporting. Of course, we don’t seek conflict. We don’t seek to exacerbate regional tensions, and in fact, we have welcomed steps to de-escalate tensions in the region. We want to see tensions de-escalated. What we are doing is taking prudent steps together with our partners to help defend ourselves against the escalatory steps that Iran unfortunately has taken.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And you mentioned communicating with Iran via the Europeans, the EU, the Europeans. How about the Russians right now, given the situation with the war and the tension here? Because for example, just today the Russian ambassador in Vienna met with his Iranian counterpart on the JCPOA, on the talks. Is the U.S. still communicating, consulting, talking to the Russian counterpart in Vienna on continuing or finalizing the talks one way or another?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Rob’s engagements have primarily been with our European partners and allies. He does occasionally speak with other partners and allies around the globe. I believe recently he spoke to his South Korean counterpart. There are a number of global partners who are in some way part of this, whether or not they’re part of the P5+1 or have a stake in the outcome of this. But right now, our primary partners are our European allies.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Ned. Today the Iranian foreign minister said, quote, “The American side had told Iran the IAEA Board of Governors’ resolution would be void of any content.” A few days before this, another source close to the Islamic Republic of Iran said – claimed, quote, “Forty-eight hours before IAEA’s Board of Governors’ resolution, Biden sent a secret message to Iran that said, ‘The resolution’s text is toned down. Don’t retaliate as my administration’s hands are tied by Congress.’” Can you confirm sending this message to Iran?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I can deny sending that message to Iran.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. And this just came in &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You personally or the entire government?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I am not aware that any such message has been sent, neither is anyone in this building.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But you can admit that you – your tone in the statement from Ms. Holgate, your representative at IAEA, the tone was very mild. Also, we can detect that in Mr. Sullivan’s words, Mr. Malley’s tweets, Mr. Blinken’s statement. You wanted to de-escalate. Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We wanted to register our serious concern with the status of Iran’s nuclear program. That is precisely what this Board of Governors’ resolution did. It made clear our serious concerns that Iran has failed to credibly respond to the IAEA’s questions regarding potential undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. This is a step that the Board of Governors had not taken in some time. We thought it was important that the United States work closely with our European allies and our other partners on the Board of Governors to achieve this resolution precisely to send a message.</p>
<p>If Iran seeks de-escalation, there are certain steps that Iran could take in a number of different areas. One of those areas is its nuclear program. Rather than put the brakes on its nuclear program, Iran has continued to take steps that are only escalatory and further provocative. And in response to this very Board of Governors’ resolution, a resolution that calls for more transparency, Iran has come back and countered with less transparency and has actually committed to taking offline some of the important inspections and monitoring capabilities that the IAEA has long maintained.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Ned, this just came in. Mr. Grossi just said to Al Arabiya that in his belief you have reached a dead end in the negotiation. This is just few minutes ago. Considering how apolitical Mr. Grossi was always and IAEA, they never took any political stance, what do you think about this statement from Mr. Grossi? Where are we going from here? Is there a Plan B?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What I would say is that the steps that Iran has taken, the steps that Iran has threatened, would vastly complicate a return to the deal, a potential return to the deal that was already vastly complicated by a number of issues, including Iran’s insistence on bringing in issues that are extraneous to the JCPOA.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, we are going to judge the utility and the wisdom of a potential mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA on the basis of our national security interest. And if the deal that has been on the table for some time conveys advantages to us in terms of our national security – advantages that, by the way, would work to the benefit of our partners and allies throughout the region. We will continue to pursue it. If and when we conclude that the deal that is on the table does not convey these advantages, we won’t, and we will pursue an alternative course.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-UKRAINE"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Russian officials claim that Ukrainian forces struck within its borders, hitting near a military base. There seems to be some credible information backing up those claims. Is this something the department is looking into? And if it is confirmed, is there a concern for escalation?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, as you know, we don’t typically comment on purported strikes or specific operations from here. I would leave it to others to update and to offer assessments on tactical developments on the battlefield. What we can say is that we are doing everything we can, and it is quite a lot, to provide our Ukrainian partners with what they need to defend themselves. Since the start of the invasion, since February 24th, we’ve provided some 4.6 billion in security assistance to our Ukrainian partners, $5.3 billion since the beginning of the administration. You see the delta between those two numbers – $600 million, indicating that – sorry, $700 million – I’m bad at math – indicating that we provided Ukraine with significant assistance well before Russia began its invasion on February 24th.</p>
<p>With the assistance of Congress, the passage of the emergency supplemental, we do have additional resources. We’ve had a first presidential drawdown the other week of nearly a billion dollars in additional security assistance to our Ukrainian partners. We will continue to provide our Ukrainian partners with the security assistance and with the forms of security assistance that they need contoured to the battle that they’re facing, and the battle that they’re facing right now principally in the Donbas, where Russia is continuing to inflict violence and to cause widespread death and destruction.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And that’s regardless of whether they’re striking into Russia, as these reports say?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We will continue to provide our Ukrainian partners with what they need to defend themselves.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-CONGO"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>If it’s okay, I’ll move on to Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>M23 rebels in the DRC have seized an eastern border town. Congo has repeatedly accused Rwanda of backing the M23. What is the State Department’s assessment of Rwandan support for the M23?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, we spoke to this the other week, but we are alarmed by reports of cross-border violence between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and the increasing tensions between those two countries. We’re deeply concerned by reports of Rwandan military personnel participating in this fighting. We urge both sides to exercise restraint and to engage in immediate dialogue to de-escalate tensions and end hostilities. We – as we’ve said before, we support the continuation of the Nairobi Process and mediation efforts by the African Union. And we encourage countries in the region to exercise responsible, constructive leadership and work together to advance peace and security in the eastern DRC.</p>
<p>We call on both sides to meet soon to reach a lasting resolution to this regionally destabilizing situation and to avoid rhetoric that could inflame ethnic tensions and hate speech and/or put UN peacekeepers at risk. And we’re saddened by reports of injuries and deaths caused by this cross-border artillery strikes in both directions, both this month and last month as well. We appreciate MONUSCO’s efforts in support of the armed forces of the DRC to protect civilians. We’re saddened to learn of injuries to UN peacekeepers in recent fighting.</p>
<p>M23 must terminate their offensive and immediately cease these attacks, which cause suffering, especially to vulnerable populations. And we continue to urge M23 and all non-state armed groups operating in this region, in the eastern DRC, to cease violence against civilians, to disband, and to lay down their arms. We know that the people of eastern Congo have suffered violence and displacement for far too long, and we’ll continue to do what we can, together with our partners, including those at the UN, to bring a halt to this escalation.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Sorry, Ned, isn’t that pretty much exactly what you said after the Secretary met with the – Congo foreign minister?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, I would say that the underlying dynamics of this conflict have not changed, but &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Has your – has anything changed in your &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes, there &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>It has?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>It has, it has.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>What has changed? What’s different about what you just said than what you said 10 days ago?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>The artillery strikes have continued, and I made reference to what we’ve seen this month as well. But as you said, Matt, the – as I said, actually, the underlying dynamics of this conflict have not changed.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-MALI"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah, we saw that Special Envoy Carstens was in Mali and met with leaders there. Can you just share any readout or what he was there for?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>What I can say – and I will defer to my colleagues in his office if they have any more to say, but the special envoy routinely travels around the world. Sometimes we make that travel public, as we did in his recent travel to Lebanon. Sometimes we don’t. So I will defer to them if they have anything more to say on that potential travel.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On this, Ned &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-LEBANON"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; did the Senior Advisor Hochstein make any progress in his talks in Beirut? And what is the next step? Will he be going to Israel (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we announced last week that Senior Advisor Amos Hochstein was in Lebanon to meet with leaders and to facilitate and accelerate negotiations. We’ve called on all sides to seek a negotiated resolution to the maritime boundary dispute. We’re not going to get into the details of that diplomacy, but it is very much an effort that is ongoing and that Senior Advisor Hochstein will continue to be engaged on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is he going to Israel?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Don’t have any travel to announce at the moment. As I understand it, he’s on his way back to the United States right now.</p>
<p>Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, thank you.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-IRAN2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Turning quickly back to Iran, the satellite company Maxar has images from today that it says are probable launch activities. Do you have any comment on the specific probable launch and how the U.S. would respond?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t beyond what I said previously, that it is Iran that has consistently chosen to escalate tensions. It is Iran that has consistently chosen to take provocative actions. We urge Iran to de-escalate, to cease with its provocative activities, but not going to entertain a hypothetical like that.</p>
<p>Yes, and then I’ll go to you, Said. Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-ISRAEL2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, any update about reopening the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem? Should we expect any announcement during President Biden’s trip to the West Bank?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have any update for you beyond what we’ve said previously, and namely that we are committed to reopening the consulate in Jerusalem. In the meantime, we have a team on the ground that manages our relationship with the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just to follow-up on this &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Said, mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Today there was a meeting between Barbara Leaf with the Palestinian prime minister, and he in fact demanded that the consulate be open. So is there a timeframe? I know I asked you this question, and forgive me because I asked it so many times. But are we likely – are we getting closer to sort of a timeframe for reopening the consulate?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> There’s not a timeframe I can provide you other than to reiterate what I just said, that we remain committed to reopening the consulate in Jerusalem. It is part and parcel of our effort to re-engage with the Palestinian Authority, the Palestinian people. You have to remember that when we took office in January of last year, there had been almost a complete rupture, a complete severance between the United States Government and the Palestinian Authority, and in some ways the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>So over the past 15 months, we have invested in recreating, re-establishing that relationship – that relationship between the U.S. Government and the PA. But importantly, that relationship between the U.S. Government and the Palestinian people, a relationship that has allowed us to provide significant funds of humanitarian assistance directly to the Palestinian people in a way that will tangibly improve their lives.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Now also, the PLO office in Washington, any prospects for reopening that office?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have an update for you there. This is a complex issue, as you know. It’s one we continue to discuss with our Palestinian counterparts but also with Congress as well.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. I have a couple more on the Palestinian issue. On – the other day, Secretary Blinken said that he would support an independent investigation of the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh. Could you explain to us what is that? What form would that independent investigation take?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> There has been no change in our approach, and we’ve been consistent on this since the earliest hours after learning of the tragic and reprehensible death of Shireen Abu Akleh. We continue to call for a thorough, credible investigation that culminates in accountability.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. But he said the word “independent,” so is that independent as perhaps a third party – not Israel, not the Palestinians, someone else?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Our approach remains the same. We continue to call for a thorough, credible investigation that culminates in accountability.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> There was a thorough report in <em>The Washington Post</em> that was published on Sunday, and basically it shows that it was an Israeli soldier who shot the shot that killed Shireen Abu Akleh. I mean, all the evidence is there, but the Israelis are saying there was no criminal intent, that – they closed the book – almost they’ve closed the book on that. Would that cause you to be outraged if they closed the book on investigating &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Would it – sorry, would it cause &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Israelis are – they’re saying – in fact, the chief of staff of the Israeli army, Kochavi, he said there was no – there will not be any sort of criminal pursuit of whoever did that. If it happened, it may have happened accidentally, or so is the suggestion. Would that be satisfactory to you?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We – look, Said, we want to see an investigation that is thorough, credible, that culminates in accountability, and that does so on a swift basis. We’ve been in close contact with our Israeli, with our Palestinian counterparts as well to urge authorities to fully cooperate in investigating the circumstances of Shireen Abu Akleh’s killing, and that includes to share forensic evidence. We have – we’ve made clear our view to Israel and the Palestinian Authority that we expect, as I’ve said before, this thorough, transparent, and impartial investigation into the circumstances of her killing and in a manner that culminates in accountability.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay. Thank you very &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I have one more about the trip.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The President’s trip, that is.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-INDIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> In this call that was done last night by a White House official, it talked about this meeting between India, Israel, the U.S. and &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The I2-U2.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. Who the hell comes up with these names?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> (Laughter.) I think that one’s – I actually like that one a lot.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You do? Really?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is it like a – it’s like faux Star Wars thing?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, you know some of our acronyms. They’re – many are as good as that one.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, I know. But this one seems too – I2-U2. Really?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That’s what’s &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Anyway, that’s not my question.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But what is the intent? What’s the reason behind this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Not the acronym, but the actual formation of it.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. So part of our approach is – from the start, not only to revitalize and to re-energize our system of alliances and partnerships around the world – and I think we’ve done that to a good degree – but also to stitch together partnerships and alliances that didn’t exist previously or that previously weren’t utilized to their full extent. The Quad is a good example of an alliance that previously may not have lived up to its full potential, and of course, we’ve invested heavily in the Quad with virtual meetings at the leader level, in-person meetings at the leader level, and with Secretary Blinken convening his Quad ministerial counterparts on a number of occasions as well.</p>
<p>AUKUS, another good example, taking a key ally in the Indo-Pacific &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Another ridiculous acronym.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; taking a key ally in Europe, stitching those together in a way that will work to our benefit but will also help our allies help each other in a number of realms, not only in the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, but what – specifically what does India bring to the table in this group? What do the Emirates bring to the table in this group? What does Israel, other than being the host of this &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, on their own, each of these countries bring to the table a number of interests &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. But – all right. So if you wanted a second U, you could have invited Uzbekistan. So why not Uzbekistan instead of the Emirates? What specifically do they &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’ll make a couple points. Each of these countries are technological hubs. Biotechnology, of course, is prominent in each of these countries as well. Deepening trade and economic ties between these countries is in our interest when it comes to the relationship between Israel and the UAE. That’s something we have sought to deepen. These two countries have, of course, deepened their relationship in recent years, including in the economic realm.</p>
<p>India, of course, is a massive market. It is a massive consumer market. It’s a massive producer of high-tech and highly sought-after goods as well. So there are a number of areas where these countries can work together, whether it’s technology, whether it’s trade, whether it is climate, whether it’s COVID, and potentially even security as well, so &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. I should just note that the second U could have been Uruguay too, so I don’t want to leave anyone out.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, don’t want to rule out any potential future groupings. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>

									<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Washington, DC</p>
<p>2:24 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-DEPARTMENT"></a><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Just a couple things at the top. First, we are very pleased to welcome today five journalists visiting us from Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. These journalists are here part of the Vaclav Havel Journalism Fellowship, a unique joint initiative between RFE/RL and the Czech Republic for aspiring journalists in support of pluralism, press freedom, and media independence everywhere. Welcome to you all. Welcome to the State Department.</p>
<p>And before we begin, allow me just a moment of personal privilege. And I need to stop making a habit out of this, but we have another very sad departure from my team. JT Ice, who has served as our deputy spox for the past two-plus years, just over two years, having started in June of 2020, will be moving on today. Today is his final day, I am very sad to say. JT, as you all know, is a career member of the Foreign Service. He has had a storied career overseas, here as well, and his tenure on the spokesperson’s team across these two administrations has been a fine example of that.</p>
<p>I met JT on January 20th around 8:30 in the morning or so, and he’s been by my side ever since. I could not have done the job without him, without his expertise, without his experience, without his wise counsel at every step of the way. So JT will be sorely missed, not only by me but everyone in the bureau, everyone on my team, and many, many people in this department. Of course, he’s not going far. He is going to the very pleasant confines of the Naval War College for a tour there before he continues with his next adventure in the Foreign Service.</p>
<p>So JT, thank you. And with that, turn to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks, Ned. Welcome back. And JT, have fun in Rhode Island. I hope they’re ready for you there.</p>
<p>Can I just very briefly – is something wrong with the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I think the floor is yours.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-RUSSIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> There was – there was an echo. Before we – I just want to ask very briefly if you’re aware of Brittney Griner’s detention being extended by the Russians.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So I’ve seen those reports. I’ve seen the reports emanate from Russia that her detention has been extended. Our position for some time on this has been very clear: Brittney Griner should not be detained. She should not be detained for a single day longer. We have characterized her, we have characterized Paul Whelan, who has also spent far too long in Russian detention, as wrongful detainees. The team here, individuals around the world, are working around the clock to secure and to effect their safe and prompt release and also the safe and prompt release of wrongful American detainees around the world.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But were you aware – was the embassy aware that there was a hearing or that this was a possibility today? Was there an actual hearing that anyone was able to go to?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> My understanding is that we became aware through TASS.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So nothing?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I was &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And subsequent to the TASS report, have you been able to confirm with Russian authorities that this is, in fact, the case?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> To confirm that her detention has been extended?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Look, we are in constant contact regarding her case. We are in constant contact with her team and her network back here at home. I think you all have seen that yesterday representatives of the department, representatives of the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, and a senior representative from our Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs met with the Phoenix Mercury, as they are here, so we are regularly keeping them apprised of her case.</p>
<p>We were last able to have consular access to Brittney Griner last month. We continue to press for regular, continued access to all American detainees who are in pretrial detention, whether they are unjustly detained, as is Brittney Griner, or whether they are facing criminal charges. This is a case that we are working assiduously behind the scenes. We’ve been in regular contact with Russian authorities regarding it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Well, I mean, is it problematic for you? Are you going to complain to the Russians that you were given no &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, of course it’s problematic. Her detention &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, no. Well, I get &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Her &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I get the entire detention is &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let’s leave aside – let’s leave aside &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. But what happened today – right, I get that the entire thing is problematic for you. I understand that. But I’m talking about specifically what happened today, the fact that you learned about it from a state news agency and there was no apparent – no notification to the embassy or the consular officials there. Is that in particular a problem for you?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t want to speak for the embassy and whether they had any contact prior to this. I can tell you that everyone I’ve spoken to learned of it today from the news reports. But to your question, absolutely this is problematic. This case is problematic from top to bottom. It is precisely why we have characterized Brittney Griner as a wrongful detainee. It’s precisely why we are doing everything we can to see and to effect her prompt release from Russian detention.</p>
<p>Yes, Francesco.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, also on Russian detainees, do you have any comment on Navalny being transferred to a more strict colony and his lawyers saying they don’t know where exactly he is?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, similarly, we’ve seen these reports that Aleksey Navalny has been transferred from the penal colony where he has been in prison and that his current whereabouts are unknown. We call on Russian authorities to allow Mr. Navalny access to his lawyers, to his legal representation, as well as to receive medical care. We have communicated to the Russian Government repeatedly that they are responsible for what happens to Mr. Navalny as he is in their custody. They will be held accountable by the international community were anything to befall Mr. Navalny while he is in their custody.</p>
<p>His exposure over many years of this government’s corruption and his pro-democracy activism prompted this politically motivated arrest. We have urged authorities to take all necessary action to ensure his safety and good health, and we reiterate our call for his immediate release, as well as an end to the persecution of his many supporters.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You have communicated that to the Russian Government even after February 24th?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We have communicated this to the Russian Government previously, and I am confident that we will be in a position to reiterate that message soon.</p>
<p>Yes, Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On U.S. detainees, how many are in pretrial detention right now in Russia?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So this is a figure, especially in a country as large as Russia, that is constantly changing. It doesn’t do us any good to release a particular figure on any given day. There are cases where Americans are detained and subsequently released in short order; there are cases where Americans are detained and are held for far too long, as is the case with Brittney Griner, as is the case with Paul Whelan, as was the case with Trevor Reed. So we are working and making the point relentlessly to our Russian counterparts that, consistent with their obligations under the Vienna Convention, consistent with their obligations under our bilateral arrangements, we expect to have regular access to Americans who are held in pretrial detention.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And when was the last time the embassy had access to Paul Whelan?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’ll get you the updated date there, but it was – we’ll get you the updated date.</p>
<p>Yes, over here.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-IRAN"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can we switch to Iran?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Iranian foreign minister has said that they put forward a new proposal to revive the JCPOA. Is that true, and if so, when did they make this proposal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> As we and our European partners have made clear, we are prepared to immediately conclude and implement the deal we negotiated in Vienna, the deal that has been on the table for a number of months now for a mutual return to full compliance with the JCPOA. But for that to happen, Tehran needs to decide to drop demands that go beyond the scope of the JCPOA, needs to decide to drop issues that are extraneous to the JCPOA.</p>
<p>We have made very clear where we are. We believe that if Iran makes this political decision, we’ll be in a position to conclude and to pursue a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA very swiftly. If Iran does not do that, it will further imperil the odds that we will ever be able to reach a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But has Iran put a new proposal forward?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We have been in regular indirect contact via the European Union, so we’re not going to speak to the specifics – specific dynamics of this diplomacy other than to say that Enrique Mora has been – has served as an important go-between role, and we await a constructive response from the Iranians, a response that leaves behind issues that are extraneous to the JCPOA.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So, Ned, you’re saying “extraneous.” What are the extraneous things that they are asking? Can you explain, please?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Extraneous in this case means something that is not a part – should not be a part of the JCPOA.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I know perfectly well what it means. I’m just saying, what are these things?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Look, I’m not going to get into the diplomacy. I’m not going to speak to proposals that the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Is it something akin to the Iranians maybe demanding some sort of a guarantee that you will not have a new administration nullifying whatever deal you arrive at? Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> On that, Said – yeah, fancy, huh. On that, Said, we have made very clear to the Iranians – we did this in October of last year when the President met with our European – with his European counterparts in Rome on the sidelines of the G20. And if you take a close look at the readout that emanated from that meeting, we made very clear that our intention is and was – was and is – to effect a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA and that we intend to remain there, in so long as Iran would live up to its end of the deal. It would serve us no purpose to achieve a mutual return to compliance only to scrap it down the line.</p>
<p>Now, beyond that, I’m not going to speak to proposals that have been sent back and forth, other than to say we are prepared to re-enter the JCPOA on a mutual basis. That is to say, if Iran decides that it is willing to reimpose the nuclear restrictions that the JCPOA calls for, we are willing to do what is necessary in terms of sanctions lifting on our end to once again be in compliance with the JCPOA. That choice is now Iran’s. It has been Iran’s for some time. There has been a deal that has been on the table in Vienna for a number of months now. It is a deal that is still in our national security interest, because it is a deal that conveys nonproliferation advantages that are – that go beyond what we have now.</p>
<p>And what we have now – the urgency that we have now and the challenge that we face – is that, given the advancements Iran has been able to make to its nuclear program since May of 2018, when the last administration abandoned the nuclear deal, a nuclear deal that – with which Iran was in full compliance, by the way – Iran has advanced its nuclear programs in ways that are profoundly dangerous and that are profoundly corrosive to the global nonproliferation regime. We went from a breakout time that upon implementation of the JCPOA that was out at about 12 months, it is a breakout time that is now measured in weeks or less. To us, that is unacceptable. That is why we continue to pursue a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA. We will do that for as long as the deal that’s on the table conveys benefits that the present moment, in terms of Iran’s nuclear program, does not.</p>
<p>Michel.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, until when will you keep talking to the Iranians? And second, on the deterrence front, is the U.S. trying to form a coalition in the region that includes Israel and Arab countries to counter the Iranian influence?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So on the first part of your question, as you know, we’re not talking directly to the Iranians. As we’ve said before, we would prefer that. It would make the business of diplomacy much simpler. It would allow us to address complex and multifaceted issues in a more effective way. But of course, the Iranians have not been willing to do that, and so, as I mentioned a moment ago, we have been going through the – our European partners and allies to convey these messages.</p>
<p>In terms of the timeframe – and what I just said is the core point – we will continue to pursue a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA for as long as doing so is in our national interest. And right now, a mutual return to the JCPOA would convey nonproliferation benefits that we don’t have at the present moment. Again, the fact is that Iran’s breakout time is dangerously low at the present. It has dwindled by months and months since Iran began distancing itself from the stringent requirements of the JCPOA in mid-2018.</p>
<p>We are constantly looking at the nonproliferation benefits that a mutual return to compliance would convey versus what we have now. Every week, every day that this goes on, those benefits are eroded. So we will reach a point where a mutual return to compliance is no longer in our interest. Even if we wanted to, that’s not – almost certainly not a date that I could give you right now because it is based on an assessment of where Iran’s program is. It is based on an assessment of what a mutual return to compliance would convey in terms of a resulting breakout time, and that’s an assessment that experts here, experts in our Intelligence Community and elsewhere, are constantly refining to determine what’s in our national interest.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On the second question?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And you expect – and you would expect Rob Malley and Brett McGurk, when they go up to the Hill for this closed hearing before SFRC tomorrow, to make the same case that it is still – that the administration still assesses that it is in the U.S. national interest to return to compliance?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It is the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Because if that’s going to be their message, it’s going to be a long meeting and not a very pleasant one for them.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I can’t speak to the reaction that we’ll hear from the Hill, other than to say that we regularly engage with our counterparts on Capitol Hill. As you know, Matt, it was just last month that Rob Malley spent several hours in an open hearing before lawmakers.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, but this one is closed, which means that it might – well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, and &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; I suppose maybe there might – that there might be less, like, public performance, but &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, the message you heard from Rob when he was before lawmakers last month is consistent with where we are now, and Rob made the case &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. So then what’s the point of going up there to do this classified briefing if your position is still the same?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The point of going up there is that we want to ensure that we keep lawmakers fully and presently informed of what it is that we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Since the appearance last month, there has been this IAEA report; there has been the Board of Governors resolution. So things have changed.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Of course. And I am confident that every time we speak to lawmakers that they will pose those questions and that we will offer those answers.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-ISRAEL"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So realistically, if the President goes to Israel, let’s say around the 15th of July and so on, as planned or scheduled, before arriving at a – or returning back to this deal, is it likely that it’s dead in the water and then would you – would it be dead by then?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Again, we’re not going to put a timeframe on it, largely because we can’t. It is a &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> If the trip is made before a deal is &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It is an assessment. It is an assessment that is evolving as Iran’s nuclear program advances. And if Iran continues to make these advances, if it continues to spin advanced centrifuges, if it continues to blow beyond limits to its stockpile, this is a deal that, before too long, will not convey the nonproliferation benefits that we would need it to convey if we were to pursue it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, you didn’t answer my second question.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Oh. On the – look, the – we are – and you’ve heard from – this from us before, consistently, and again today with the announcement of the President’s travel to Israel, but our commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad. And we, in cooperation with our allies and regional partners, including Israel, we will use every appropriate tool at our disposal to confront the IRGC’s destabilizing influence in the region. You’ve seen evidence of that with the financial sanctions that we’ve imposed. We continue to coordinate closely with our Israeli partners on this, with our Gulf partners, with our – with other partners throughout the Middle East. And I have no doubt that the challenge that Iran poses to the region and beyond will be high on the agenda when President Biden is in Israel next month and when he is in Saudi Arabia next month meeting with the GCC and meeting with his Saudi partners as well.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So on the trip &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let me move around &#8212;</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-SAUDI"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But since you are on the trip, what has changed, meaning – I mean, the President when he was running for office, he called Saudi Arabia a pariah and so on. What has changed since then that Saudi Arabia is recognized, as it is has always been, as a major partner of the United States?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Said, this is a President as – who, of course, will not hesitate when we have an opportunity to engage in a way that advances America’s interests and in a way that is consistent with our values. I can tell you what hasn’t changed, and President Biden actually said this just the other week. He said, “I’m not going to change my view on human rights.” So in every relationship, of course, we bring our values with us, and human rights is always on the agenda. Human rights is always on the table. So, too, are the interests of the American people. And these two things can be – and I would say must be – complementary.</p>
<p>When it comes to Saudi Arabia, this is a relationship where a multiplicity of interests are at play. Of course, there is the issue of extremism, of terrorism. We have worked side-by-side with our Saudi partners for years on this scourge, combatting it. There’s the issue of Yemen, and just the other week there was an extension of the truce in Yemen, a truce that is now in its ninth week, a truce that has allowed humanitarian access to parts of Yemen that have been bereft of aid and humanitarian assistance for far too long.</p>
<p>One of the first appointments from this administration was when President Biden came here early on. It was maybe the second week of the administration, and we made public our appointment of Tim Lenderking as a special envoy for Yemen. Over the course of these past 15 or so months, Special Envoy Lenderking and his team have worked assiduously with partners around the world, including the UN, now UN Special Envoy Hans Grundberg, but also with partners in the Gulf and principally with our Saudi partners. Saudi Arabia was pivotal to getting to that humanitarian ceasefire and indispensable to extending it just the other week.</p>
<p>This is not only about a civil war in Yemen, which of course is a cause of great concern for the United States, both the violence, the instability, and the humanitarian implications, but this is also about our direct interests, our core interests, the number – hundreds – of cross-border attacks have emanated from Yemen in recent years. Of course, that is of concern to us for the threat that it poses to Saudi Arabia, but it’s also of concern to us because there are 70,000 Americans in the kingdom.</p>
<p>Beyond Yemen, there is the question of regional stability. There is the question of healing regional rifts, regional divides within the Gulf, within Lebanon. Saudi Arabia has been a partner on that as well. We’ve talked about the challenge that Iran poses. Not only are we working with Israel, we are working closely with our Gulf partners, including the Saudis, and the broader GCC, by the way, the GCC+3, which will be in Saudi Arabia when President Biden visits there.</p>
<p>There are also other interests, including energy, and we’ve spoken of our desire to see a steady global supply of energy. This has been a topic of discussion on a bilateral basis with members of OPEC. It will be on the agenda when President Biden meets with the GCC and meets with Saudi counterparts in Saudi Arabia next month as well.</p>
<p>So I think you can see the line through all of this is doing whatever we can to pursue America’s interests while not leaving by the wayside our values. And one of the first things that we did, one of the first marquee events – I believe it might have been his second visit down to this very room – Secretary Blinken came down, released the Khashoggi report, a report that was compiled under the previous administration, released it with the full imprimatur of the U.S. Government; in a powerful signal, and a signal of our commitment to human rights, our prioritization of human rights, announced the Khashoggi Ban.</p>
<p>We’ve implemented the Khashoggi Ban dozens of times. We’ve sanctioned the quick reaction force. We’ve taken measures to hold accountable those who have committed grave human rights abuses, and we’ll continue to do that. But we can have human rights at the center of our foreign policy, as they have been, as we continue to pursue the interests of the American people across all of these interests and the many other interests that we have and that we share with our Saudi partners.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-MIDDLEEAST"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Following up on Michel’s question about the military defense system probably in the Middle East, I think he spoke generally, including the Arab countries of the region. You addressed Israel, but does the same policy apply towards the Arab countries of the region? And don’t you think – and last week, late last week, there was a bipartisan legislation both in the House and the Senate to arm – to bolster the military or defense capabilities of these countries vis-à-vis Iran. Wouldn’t that just aggravate things in the region and probably cause Iran to react in a more even – more disturbing way?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, the shared interests that I mentioned a moment ago that we have with our Saudi partners, we have with the full array of our Gulf partners, and that is why we see this as an important moment to have high-level engagement with the GCC, with the GCC+3 in this case, because Iran does pose a challenge to the broader region. It’s also why Rob Malley and his team, not only have they regularly updated our Israeli partners on the progress, or in some cases – in most cases – lack thereof with regard to a potential mutual return to compliance, but Rob has briefed the GCC. And late last year, there was a statement put out by the GCC indicating their support for the prospect of a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA, because these countries know the challenge that Iran poses. They know the nonproliferation benefits that a potential return to compliance with the JCPOA would convey not only for us, but also an arrangement that would have – that would redound positively to their national security interest.</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is yes, we work cooperatively not only with Israel, but our other partners in the Gulf on the challenge that Iran poses.</p>
<p>To the second part of your question, everything we’re doing is defensive in nature. Iran – it is Iran that is funding proxies. It is Iran that is fueling instability. It is Iran that is providing support to bad actors in places like Yemen and Syria and elsewhere. And it’s Iran that is supporting terrorist groups. So everything we are doing is with an eye to counteract the malign influence that Iran is in many cases exporting. Of course, we don’t seek conflict. We don’t seek to exacerbate regional tensions, and in fact, we have welcomed steps to de-escalate tensions in the region. We want to see tensions de-escalated. What we are doing is taking prudent steps together with our partners to help defend ourselves against the escalatory steps that Iran unfortunately has taken.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And you mentioned communicating with Iran via the Europeans, the EU, the Europeans. How about the Russians right now, given the situation with the war and the tension here? Because for example, just today the Russian ambassador in Vienna met with his Iranian counterpart on the JCPOA, on the talks. Is the U.S. still communicating, consulting, talking to the Russian counterpart in Vienna on continuing or finalizing the talks one way or another?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Rob’s engagements have primarily been with our European partners and allies. He does occasionally speak with other partners and allies around the globe. I believe recently he spoke to his South Korean counterpart. There are a number of global partners who are in some way part of this, whether or not they’re part of the P5+1 or have a stake in the outcome of this. But right now, our primary partners are our European allies.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Ned. Today the Iranian foreign minister said, quote, “The American side had told Iran the IAEA Board of Governors’ resolution would be void of any content.” A few days before this, another source close to the Islamic Republic of Iran said – claimed, quote, “Forty-eight hours before IAEA’s Board of Governors’ resolution, Biden sent a secret message to Iran that said, ‘The resolution’s text is toned down. Don’t retaliate as my administration’s hands are tied by Congress.’” Can you confirm sending this message to Iran?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I can deny sending that message to Iran.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. And this just came in &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You personally or the entire government?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I am not aware that any such message has been sent, neither is anyone in this building.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But you can admit that you – your tone in the statement from Ms. Holgate, your representative at IAEA, the tone was very mild. Also, we can detect that in Mr. Sullivan’s words, Mr. Malley’s tweets, Mr. Blinken’s statement. You wanted to de-escalate. Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We wanted to register our serious concern with the status of Iran’s nuclear program. That is precisely what this Board of Governors’ resolution did. It made clear our serious concerns that Iran has failed to credibly respond to the IAEA’s questions regarding potential undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. This is a step that the Board of Governors had not taken in some time. We thought it was important that the United States work closely with our European allies and our other partners on the Board of Governors to achieve this resolution precisely to send a message.</p>
<p>If Iran seeks de-escalation, there are certain steps that Iran could take in a number of different areas. One of those areas is its nuclear program. Rather than put the brakes on its nuclear program, Iran has continued to take steps that are only escalatory and further provocative. And in response to this very Board of Governors’ resolution, a resolution that calls for more transparency, Iran has come back and countered with less transparency and has actually committed to taking offline some of the important inspections and monitoring capabilities that the IAEA has long maintained.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Ned, this just came in. Mr. Grossi just said to Al Arabiya that in his belief you have reached a dead end in the negotiation. This is just few minutes ago. Considering how apolitical Mr. Grossi was always and IAEA, they never took any political stance, what do you think about this statement from Mr. Grossi? Where are we going from here? Is there a Plan B?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What I would say is that the steps that Iran has taken, the steps that Iran has threatened, would vastly complicate a return to the deal, a potential return to the deal that was already vastly complicated by a number of issues, including Iran’s insistence on bringing in issues that are extraneous to the JCPOA.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, we are going to judge the utility and the wisdom of a potential mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA on the basis of our national security interest. And if the deal that has been on the table for some time conveys advantages to us in terms of our national security – advantages that, by the way, would work to the benefit of our partners and allies throughout the region. We will continue to pursue it. If and when we conclude that the deal that is on the table does not convey these advantages, we won’t, and we will pursue an alternative course.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-UKRAINE"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Russian officials claim that Ukrainian forces struck within its borders, hitting near a military base. There seems to be some credible information backing up those claims. Is this something the department is looking into? And if it is confirmed, is there a concern for escalation?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, as you know, we don’t typically comment on purported strikes or specific operations from here. I would leave it to others to update and to offer assessments on tactical developments on the battlefield. What we can say is that we are doing everything we can, and it is quite a lot, to provide our Ukrainian partners with what they need to defend themselves. Since the start of the invasion, since February 24th, we’ve provided some 4.6 billion in security assistance to our Ukrainian partners, $5.3 billion since the beginning of the administration. You see the delta between those two numbers – $600 million, indicating that – sorry, $700 million – I’m bad at math – indicating that we provided Ukraine with significant assistance well before Russia began its invasion on February 24th.</p>
<p>With the assistance of Congress, the passage of the emergency supplemental, we do have additional resources. We’ve had a first presidential drawdown the other week of nearly a billion dollars in additional security assistance to our Ukrainian partners. We will continue to provide our Ukrainian partners with the security assistance and with the forms of security assistance that they need contoured to the battle that they’re facing, and the battle that they’re facing right now principally in the Donbas, where Russia is continuing to inflict violence and to cause widespread death and destruction.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And that’s regardless of whether they’re striking into Russia, as these reports say?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>We will continue to provide our Ukrainian partners with what they need to defend themselves.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-CONGO"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>If it’s okay, I’ll move on to Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>M23 rebels in the DRC have seized an eastern border town. Congo has repeatedly accused Rwanda of backing the M23. What is the State Department’s assessment of Rwandan support for the M23?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, we spoke to this the other week, but we are alarmed by reports of cross-border violence between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and the increasing tensions between those two countries. We’re deeply concerned by reports of Rwandan military personnel participating in this fighting. We urge both sides to exercise restraint and to engage in immediate dialogue to de-escalate tensions and end hostilities. We – as we’ve said before, we support the continuation of the Nairobi Process and mediation efforts by the African Union. And we encourage countries in the region to exercise responsible, constructive leadership and work together to advance peace and security in the eastern DRC.</p>
<p>We call on both sides to meet soon to reach a lasting resolution to this regionally destabilizing situation and to avoid rhetoric that could inflame ethnic tensions and hate speech and/or put UN peacekeepers at risk. And we’re saddened by reports of injuries and deaths caused by this cross-border artillery strikes in both directions, both this month and last month as well. We appreciate MONUSCO’s efforts in support of the armed forces of the DRC to protect civilians. We’re saddened to learn of injuries to UN peacekeepers in recent fighting.</p>
<p>M23 must terminate their offensive and immediately cease these attacks, which cause suffering, especially to vulnerable populations. And we continue to urge M23 and all non-state armed groups operating in this region, in the eastern DRC, to cease violence against civilians, to disband, and to lay down their arms. We know that the people of eastern Congo have suffered violence and displacement for far too long, and we’ll continue to do what we can, together with our partners, including those at the UN, to bring a halt to this escalation.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Sorry, Ned, isn’t that pretty much exactly what you said after the Secretary met with the – Congo foreign minister?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, I would say that the underlying dynamics of this conflict have not changed, but &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Has your – has anything changed in your &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Yes, there &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>It has?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>It has, it has.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>What has changed? What’s different about what you just said than what you said 10 days ago?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>The artillery strikes have continued, and I made reference to what we’ve seen this month as well. But as you said, Matt, the – as I said, actually, the underlying dynamics of this conflict have not changed.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-MALI"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah, we saw that Special Envoy Carstens was in Mali and met with leaders there. Can you just share any readout or what he was there for?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>What I can say – and I will defer to my colleagues in his office if they have any more to say, but the special envoy routinely travels around the world. Sometimes we make that travel public, as we did in his recent travel to Lebanon. Sometimes we don’t. So I will defer to them if they have anything more to say on that potential travel.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On this, Ned &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-LEBANON"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; did the Senior Advisor Hochstein make any progress in his talks in Beirut? And what is the next step? Will he be going to Israel (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we announced last week that Senior Advisor Amos Hochstein was in Lebanon to meet with leaders and to facilitate and accelerate negotiations. We’ve called on all sides to seek a negotiated resolution to the maritime boundary dispute. We’re not going to get into the details of that diplomacy, but it is very much an effort that is ongoing and that Senior Advisor Hochstein will continue to be engaged on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is he going to Israel?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Don’t have any travel to announce at the moment. As I understand it, he’s on his way back to the United States right now.</p>
<p>Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, thank you.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-IRAN2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Turning quickly back to Iran, the satellite company Maxar has images from today that it says are probable launch activities. Do you have any comment on the specific probable launch and how the U.S. would respond?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t beyond what I said previously, that it is Iran that has consistently chosen to escalate tensions. It is Iran that has consistently chosen to take provocative actions. We urge Iran to de-escalate, to cease with its provocative activities, but not going to entertain a hypothetical like that.</p>
<p>Yes, and then I’ll go to you, Said. Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-ISRAEL2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, any update about reopening the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem? Should we expect any announcement during President Biden’s trip to the West Bank?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have any update for you beyond what we’ve said previously, and namely that we are committed to reopening the consulate in Jerusalem. In the meantime, we have a team on the ground that manages our relationship with the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just to follow-up on this &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Said, mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Today there was a meeting between Barbara Leaf with the Palestinian prime minister, and he in fact demanded that the consulate be open. So is there a timeframe? I know I asked you this question, and forgive me because I asked it so many times. But are we likely – are we getting closer to sort of a timeframe for reopening the consulate?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> There’s not a timeframe I can provide you other than to reiterate what I just said, that we remain committed to reopening the consulate in Jerusalem. It is part and parcel of our effort to re-engage with the Palestinian Authority, the Palestinian people. You have to remember that when we took office in January of last year, there had been almost a complete rupture, a complete severance between the United States Government and the Palestinian Authority, and in some ways the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>So over the past 15 months, we have invested in recreating, re-establishing that relationship – that relationship between the U.S. Government and the PA. But importantly, that relationship between the U.S. Government and the Palestinian people, a relationship that has allowed us to provide significant funds of humanitarian assistance directly to the Palestinian people in a way that will tangibly improve their lives.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Now also, the PLO office in Washington, any prospects for reopening that office?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have an update for you there. This is a complex issue, as you know. It’s one we continue to discuss with our Palestinian counterparts but also with Congress as well.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. I have a couple more on the Palestinian issue. On – the other day, Secretary Blinken said that he would support an independent investigation of the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh. Could you explain to us what is that? What form would that independent investigation take?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> There has been no change in our approach, and we’ve been consistent on this since the earliest hours after learning of the tragic and reprehensible death of Shireen Abu Akleh. We continue to call for a thorough, credible investigation that culminates in accountability.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. But he said the word “independent,” so is that independent as perhaps a third party – not Israel, not the Palestinians, someone else?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Our approach remains the same. We continue to call for a thorough, credible investigation that culminates in accountability.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> There was a thorough report in <em>The Washington Post</em> that was published on Sunday, and basically it shows that it was an Israeli soldier who shot the shot that killed Shireen Abu Akleh. I mean, all the evidence is there, but the Israelis are saying there was no criminal intent, that – they closed the book – almost they’ve closed the book on that. Would that cause you to be outraged if they closed the book on investigating &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Would it – sorry, would it cause &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Israelis are – they’re saying – in fact, the chief of staff of the Israeli army, Kochavi, he said there was no – there will not be any sort of criminal pursuit of whoever did that. If it happened, it may have happened accidentally, or so is the suggestion. Would that be satisfactory to you?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We – look, Said, we want to see an investigation that is thorough, credible, that culminates in accountability, and that does so on a swift basis. We’ve been in close contact with our Israeli, with our Palestinian counterparts as well to urge authorities to fully cooperate in investigating the circumstances of Shireen Abu Akleh’s killing, and that includes to share forensic evidence. We have – we’ve made clear our view to Israel and the Palestinian Authority that we expect, as I’ve said before, this thorough, transparent, and impartial investigation into the circumstances of her killing and in a manner that culminates in accountability.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay. Thank you very &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I have one more about the trip.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The President’s trip, that is.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-352636-INDIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> In this call that was done last night by a White House official, it talked about this meeting between India, Israel, the U.S. and &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The I2-U2.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. Who the hell comes up with these names?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> (Laughter.) I think that one’s – I actually like that one a lot.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You do? Really?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is it like a – it’s like faux Star Wars thing?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, you know some of our acronyms. They’re – many are as good as that one.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, I know. But this one seems too – I2-U2. Really?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That’s what’s &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Anyway, that’s not my question.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But what is the intent? What’s the reason behind this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Not the acronym, but the actual formation of it.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. So part of our approach is – from the start, not only to revitalize and to re-energize our system of alliances and partnerships around the world – and I think we’ve done that to a good degree – but also to stitch together partnerships and alliances that didn’t exist previously or that previously weren’t utilized to their full extent. The Quad is a good example of an alliance that previously may not have lived up to its full potential, and of course, we’ve invested heavily in the Quad with virtual meetings at the leader level, in-person meetings at the leader level, and with Secretary Blinken convening his Quad ministerial counterparts on a number of occasions as well.</p>
<p>AUKUS, another good example, taking a key ally in the Indo-Pacific &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Another ridiculous acronym.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; taking a key ally in Europe, stitching those together in a way that will work to our benefit but will also help our allies help each other in a number of realms, not only in the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, but what – specifically what does India bring to the table in this group? What do the Emirates bring to the table in this group? What does Israel, other than being the host of this &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, on their own, each of these countries bring to the table a number of interests &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. But – all right. So if you wanted a second U, you could have invited Uzbekistan. So why not Uzbekistan instead of the Emirates? What specifically do they &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’ll make a couple points. Each of these countries are technological hubs. Biotechnology, of course, is prominent in each of these countries as well. Deepening trade and economic ties between these countries is in our interest when it comes to the relationship between Israel and the UAE. That’s something we have sought to deepen. These two countries have, of course, deepened their relationship in recent years, including in the economic realm.</p>
<p>India, of course, is a massive market. It is a massive consumer market. It’s a massive producer of high-tech and highly sought-after goods as well. So there are a number of areas where these countries can work together, whether it’s technology, whether it’s trade, whether it is climate, whether it’s COVID, and potentially even security as well, so &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. I should just note that the second U could have been Uruguay too, so I don’t want to leave anyone out.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, don’t want to rule out any potential future groupings. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you.</p>
