					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member McCaul, all committee members, thank you very, very much for this opportunity to talk about our proposed budget and how it will help achieve our national security priorities and deliver results for the American people, which is what I know all of us are about.</p>
<p>This is a critical moment for the United States and our global leadership.</p>
<p>We face major tests – you’ve alluded to some of them already – including stopping COVID-19, rising to the challenge of the climate crisis, supporting a global economic recovery that delivers for our workers and their families.</p>
<p>We got to revitalize our alliances and partnerships, out-compete China, and defend the international rules-based order against those who would seek to undermine it, renew democratic values at home and abroad, and push back against malign activity by our adversaries.</p>
<p>In a more competitive world, other countries are making historic investments in their foreign policy toolkits.  We need to do the same.</p>
<p>That’s why, in this budget, we’ve requested $58.5 billion for the State Department and USAID for Fiscal Year 2022.</p>
<p>Here are some specifics.</p>
<p>This budget will strengthen global health. The United States has been a leader in this field for decades – in Africa, around the world.</p>
<p>We’re asking for $10 billion for global health programs, including nearly $1 billion for global health security, to help us prevent, prepare for, and better respond to future global health crises so we can stop outbreaks before they turn into pandemics that put our safety and our prosperity in danger.</p>
<p>The budget will accelerate the global response to climate change and the climate crisis by providing $2.5 billion for international climate programs, including $1.25 billion for the Green Climate Fund, to help developing countries implement climate adaptation and emissions mitigation programs, which is directly in our own interest as well.</p>
<p>The budget will double down on the fight for democracy, which, as we all know, is under threat in too many places.</p>
<p>Our budget request includes $2.8 billion in foreign assistance to advance human rights, to fight corruption, stem the tide of democratic backsliding, and strengthen and defend democracies – for example, through technical training for elections and support for independent media and civil society.</p>
<p>It also requests $300 million for the National Endowment for Democracy.</p>
<p>The budget will support a comprehensive strategy to address the root causes of irregular migration from Central America.</p>
<p>It will invest $861 million in the region, as a first step toward a four-year commitment of $4 billion to help prevent violence, reduce poverty, curtail endemic corruption, and expand job and educational opportunities.</p>
<p>The budget will reestablish U.S. humanitarian leadership, with a request for 10 billion in assistance to support refugees, victims of conflict, and other displaced people, and to rebuild our refugee admissions program.</p>
<p>It will support our partners in the Middle East by fully funding our commitments to key countries, including Israel and Jordan, and by restoring humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>It includes a budget request of $3.6 billion to pay our assessed contributions in full to international organizations, initiatives, and peacekeeping efforts, including to restore our annual contributions to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>As China and others work hard to bend international organizations to their worldview, we need to ensure that these organizations instead remain grounded in the values, principles, and rules of road and rules of the world that have made our shared progress possible for so many decades.</p>
<p>Finally, to deliver in all of these areas, this budget reinvests in our most vital asset – our people.</p>
<p>It will provide new resources to recruit, train, and retain a first-rate, diverse global workforce, with nearly 500 additional Foreign and Civil Service positions – the largest increase for the State Department staffing in a decade.</p>
<p>And it will modernize our technology and cybersecurity, protect our embassies and consulates, and include a direct appropriation of $320 million for consular services worldwide, so we can continue to provide these vital services to Americans and those who seek to travel, study, or do business in the United States.</p>
<p>Our national security depends not only on the strength of our armed forces but also our ability to conduct effective diplomacy and development.</p>
<p>That’s how we solve global challenges, forge cooperation, advance our interests and values, protect our people, and prevent crises overseas from turning into emergencies here at home.</p>
<p>And that’s why diplomacy and development are smart investments for our taxpayers.</p>
<p>A top priority for me as Secretary is to restore the traditional role of Congress as a partner in our foreign policy making.</p>
<p>That’s the spirit that I bring to today’s conversation, and I’m grateful for the chance to answer your questions.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States welcomed the inaugural meeting of the Blue Dot Network Executive Consultation Group (ECG) held on June 7, 2021.  The OECD, through technical support funded by the United States and Australia, organized the ECG to convene the private sector, civil society, and academia to advise on the design and implementation of the Blue Dot Network infrastructure initiative.</p>
<p>The Blue Dot Network, announced by the United States, Australia, and Japan in November 2019, is being developed to become a certification mechanism to distinguish quality infrastructure projects that demonstrate and uphold robust standards for development.  The Blue Dot Network will be a globally recognized symbol of market-driven, transparent, and sustainable infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>More than 180 representatives from the ECG, comprising leading financiers, infrastructure developers, construction companies, and civil society organizations from around the world, gathered virtually for a strategic dialogue on catalyzing investment into quality infrastructure.   Participants exchanged views and ideas on how the Blue Dot Network initiative could help close the global infrastructure gap and create high standard, sustainable infrastructure in emerging markets.</p>
<p>The ECG meeting is part of a broader OECD effort to support development of the Blue Dot Network.  In addition to mobilizing stakeholder partnerships and establishing the value proposition of the Blue Dot Network, the OECD has begun helping the Blue Dot Network design the certification framework that is at the heart of the initiative.</p>
<p>The United States also welcomed the results of an OECD survey in which respondents endorsed the concept of the Blue Dot Network and agreed that such a certification framework to identify sustainable, high standard projects could spur greater infrastructure investment in emerging markets.  The report also identified challenges faced by infrastructure investors, including poor governance, lack of transparency, and weak legal and regulatory frameworks.  Respondents also acknowledged environmental and social risks when designing and implementing infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>The survey highlighted strong interest among respondents in environmental and social governance issues, including a commitment by 70 percent of industry respondents to establish targets to meet net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>The United States, Australia, and Japan look forward to continued collaboration with the OECD and the Executive Consultation Group on development of the Blue Dot Network.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Ben Franklin Room</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Mike Allen.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Mr. Secretary, welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Mr. Secretary, thank you for welcoming Axios on HBO into the State Department, the Benjamin Franklin State Dining Room.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>So you’ve said that job one for you is restoring partnerships and alliances.  That’s been harder than it sounded.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, it was a challenge, especially in the first couple of months.  Hard to travel because of COVID, so a lot of it was getting on the phone, starting to re-engage with partners.  We’ve finally been able to travel, and I’m finding that there’s been a real thirst and a welcoming of U.S. engagement.  I think it’s a reflection of the fact that our partners see the same thing that we do.  If you’re looking at all of the really big problems that we’re trying to solve that actually have an impact on our people’s lives – like the pandemic, like climate change, like emerging technologies that are changing lives in different ways – no one country can do it alone.  We have to find ways to cooperate, to collaborate, to do it together.  So there’s a lot of welcoming of the United States being back in the game.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>When you say back in the game, the implication is the previous administration, out of the game.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, look, I’m focused on looking forward.  When we’re not engaged, then one of two things is likely to happen.  Some other country is likely to try to engage in our place &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>China.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>For example, and maybe not in a way that advances are interests and values.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And is that already happening?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>We’ve certainly seen that.  We’ve certainly seen &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>With China?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>&#8212; China try to fill voids where we’ve been relatively disengaged.  Or maybe just as bad, no one does it and then you are likely to have chaos before you have anything else – nature, of course, a vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Naftali Bennett, who is poised to be the next prime minister of Israel, has said that he’s opposed to a two-state solution.  He says that based on security concerns, it would be suicide for Israel.  So what’s the path?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, first, let’s see what actually happens in Israel in terms of the government &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>But you agree that that’s expected?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>That seems to be expected, but again, I’m not doing politics, I’m going to focus on the policy, so we’ll see.  We will work, as we always have, with whatever the Israeli government is.  When it comes to two states, our President’s been very clear about this.  We see a two-state solution as the best and probably only means to ensure that, going forward, Israel remains not only a secure but a Jewish and democratic state, and the Palestinians have the state to which they’re entitled.</p>
<p>But the conditions right now are not – are not there.  We’ve just come off of the violence in Gaza and elsewhere.  We’re working very hard not only to make sure that the ceasefire stays in place, but to start to deal with the humanitarian situation in Gaza.  And over time, if we can build a little bit more hope, a little bit more trust, a little bit more confidence, maybe then the conditions are in place to re-engage on two states.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  The department said in May that you hadn’t personally seen the evidence Israel says it has that Hamas was occupying the tower in Gaza – that they’d took down – that had news organizations including the AP in it.  What happens if there turns out to be no smoking gun?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Two things.  First, President Biden has been very clear Israel has the right to defend itself and it was on the receiving end of indiscriminate rocket attacks coming from Gaza going after Israeli civilians.  And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So you were fine with that building being taken down?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Any country would defend itself and Israel has the right.  However, having said that, Israel as a democracy I think has an added burden to make sure it is doing everything possible to avoid civilian causalities.  And that’s what is expected of us; it’s expected of Israel.  We have our own experience with this, and I think one of the things that we found ourselves, speaking only for the United States, is that the more transparency you can provide, the more legitimacy you’re going to have.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So based on that, do you think that we’ll see clear evidence?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  All I can tell you is we’ve had information shared in intelligence channels, which I can’t, for obvious reasons, comment on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Did you find it convincing?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I can’t comment on it.  But I do think from our own experience, the more transparency, the better.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  China.  Can we win an open-ended arms race with Beijing?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, we don’t want to be in an arms race with Beijing or anyone.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We are.  We are.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  What we want – no, we’re in a very stiff competition.  Look, the relationship with China is both the most complicated and most consequential that we have.  There are adversarial aspects to it, there are competitive aspects, there are cooperative aspects.  And we have tremendous sources of strength when it comes to each one of those aspects.  We have our allies and partners, but most important, we have ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Mr. Secretary, what are the implications if Beijing is found to have been covering up a Wuhan lab leak?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We have to get to the bottom of what happened.  There’s accountability, but from my perspective the most important thing, and the most important reason we have to get to the bottom of this, is that’s the only way we’re going to be able to prevent the next pandemic, or at least do a better job in mitigating it.  What the government didn’t do in the early days and still hasn’t done is given us the transparency we need, the international community – access for inspectors and experts, the sharing of information in real time.  That has to happen.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So to get those answers, to do a proper investigation, you’re going to need – the U.S. is going to need access to the labs.  Will you demand that?  Will you put teeth on it?  Will you even go as far as sanctions on China if they keep inspectors out?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I think the international community is clear that we have to have – the international community has to have access, it has to have information, it has to have meaningful international &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So what’s the real pressure the U.S. will put on China for access to the lab?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  If China denies the information, denies the access, denies the transparency that’s needed, it is &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And you kind of expect that?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, let’s see.  Because &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>That’s been the history.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Mike, at the end of the day it’s profoundly in China’s interest to do this as well, because, look, it suffered too in the outbreak of this pandemic.  It presumably has an interest as well, especially if it purports to be a responsible international actor, to do everything it can to provide all the information it has to make sure we can hopefully prevent this from happening again.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>The Trump administration had a number of executive orders cracking down on people who were tied to the Chinese Communist Party – we’re talking about export bans.  How are you thinking about that and will you be tougher?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Look, I think the Trump administration was right to look at that.  And we’re &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And to act on it?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  And to act on it.  And we’re reviewing all of that as we speak.  And for example, it’s very important that we not – American companies or individuals – aid and abet, for example, China’s ability to use surveillance technology to repress its own people, or to export that technology to allow other autocratic or authoritarian governments from doing the same thing.  I think that’s very important.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Last stop on the tour, Russia.  With these cyber attacks, President Putin is thumbing his nose at the U.S. – blatant disrespect.  What is the U.S. going to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, what we’re going to do about it is to do what President Biden has already done, which is to make very clear &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  But it’s not working.  We’ve had our food supply threatened, we’ve had our energy supply threatened, now transportation threatened.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Look, there are – we would prefer to have a more stable, predictable relationship with Russia.  We’ve made that clear.  But we’ve made equally clear that if Russia chooses to act aggressively or recklessly toward us or toward our allies and partners, we’ll respond.</p>
<p>When it comes to these ransomware attacks, of course, we’ve already talked to the Russians about this.  One of the things we’re seeing is that criminal enterprises seem to be engaged in these attacks.  And it is an obligation on the part of any country, including Russia, if it has a criminal enterprise acting from its territory against anyone else, to do what’s necessary to stop it, to bring it to justice.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And yet, Mr. Secretary, Putin is clearly completely undeterred.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  One of the reasons that the President will be meeting with President Putin in a week’s time is not in spite of these aggressions, these attacks, it’s because of them, to tell him directly and clearly what he can expect from the United States if aggressive, reckless actions toward us continue.  Equally, though, to make clear that if Russia by its actions chooses a different course, we would prefer a more stable, predictable relationship.  There are things we can do together that would advance the security of our people, the Russian people, people around the world – strategic stability, arms control.  So we’re going to explore that.  We have to test the proposition, and the best way to do that is for the two presidents to meet face to face.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Are you optimistic that after that summit that there will be a, as you put it, “more stable” relationship?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  This is going to be a test of that proposition.  I can’t tell you whether I’m optimistic or not about the results of that test, but it’s important to do that.  And also, I don’t think we’re going to know after one meeting, but we’ll have some indications and we’ll see.  We’re prepared either way.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  What do you mean by prepared?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, as I said, we’re prepared if Russia chooses to continue reckless and aggressive action – we’re prepared to deal with that, as we have – on the other hand, if it chooses a different course, we’re prepared to engage.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>When you say back in the game, the implication is the previous administration, out of the game.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, look, I’m focused on looking forward.  When we’re not engaged, then one of two things is likely to happen.  Some other country is likely to try to engage in our place &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>China.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>For example, and maybe not in a way that advances are interests and values.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And is that already happening?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>We’ve certainly seen that.  We’ve certainly seen &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>With China?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>&#8212; China try to fill voids where we’ve been relatively disengaged.  Or maybe just as bad, no one does it and then you are likely to have chaos before you have anything else – nature, of course, a vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Naftali Bennett, who is poised to be the next prime minister of Israel, has said that he’s opposed to a two-state solution.  He says that based on security concerns, it would be suicide for Israel.  So what’s the path?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, first, let’s see what actually happens in Israel in terms of the government &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>But you agree that that’s expected?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>That seems to be expected, but again, I’m not doing politics, I’m going to focus on the policy, so we’ll see.  We will work, as we always have, with whatever the Israeli government is.  When it comes to two states, our President’s been very clear about this.  We see a two-state solution as the best and probably only means to ensure that, going forward, Israel remains not only a secure but a Jewish and democratic state, and the Palestinians have the state to which they’re entitled.</p>
<p>But the conditions right now are not – are not there.  We’ve just come off of the violence in Gaza and elsewhere.  We’re working very hard not only to make sure that the ceasefire stays in place, but to start to deal with the humanitarian situation in Gaza.  And over time, if we can build a little bit more hope, a little bit more trust, a little bit more confidence, maybe then the conditions are in place to re-engage on two states.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  The department said in May that you hadn’t personally seen the evidence Israel says it has that Hamas was occupying the tower in Gaza – that they’d took down – that had news organizations including the AP in it.  What happens if there turns out to be no smoking gun?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Two things.  First, President Biden has been very clear Israel has the right to defend itself and it was on the receiving end of indiscriminate rocket attacks coming from Gaza going after Israeli civilians.  And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So you were fine with that building being taken down?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Any country would defend itself and Israel has the right.  However, having said that, Israel as a democracy I think has an added burden to make sure it is doing everything possible to avoid civilian causalities.  And that’s what is expected of us; it’s expected of Israel.  We have our own experience with this, and I think one of the things that we found ourselves, speaking only for the United States, is that the more transparency you can provide, the more legitimacy you’re going to have.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So based on that, do you think that we’ll see clear evidence?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  All I can tell you is we’ve had information shared in intelligence channels, which I can’t, for obvious reasons, comment on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Did you find it convincing?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I can’t comment on it.  But I do think from our own experience, the more transparency, the better.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  China.  Can we win an open-ended arms race with Beijing?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, we don’t want to be in an arms race with Beijing or anyone.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We are.  We are.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  What we want – no, we’re in a very stiff competition.  Look, the relationship with China is both the most complicated and most consequential that we have.  There are adversarial aspects to it, there are competitive aspects, there are cooperative aspects.  And we have tremendous sources of strength when it comes to each one of those aspects.  We have our allies and partners, but most important, we have ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Mr. Secretary, what are the implications if Beijing is found to have been covering up a Wuhan lab leak?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We have to get to the bottom of what happened.  There’s accountability, but from my perspective the most important thing, and the most important reason we have to get to the bottom of this, is that’s the only way we’re going to be able to prevent the next pandemic, or at least do a better job in mitigating it.  What the government didn’t do in the early days and still hasn’t done is given us the transparency we need, the international community – access for inspectors and experts, the sharing of information in real time.  That has to happen.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So to get those answers, to do a proper investigation, you’re going to need – the U.S. is going to need access to the labs.  Will you demand that?  Will you put teeth on it?  Will you even go as far as sanctions on China if they keep inspectors out?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I think the international community is clear that we have to have – the international community has to have access, it has to have information, it has to have meaningful international &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So what’s the real pressure the U.S. will put on China for access to the lab?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  If China denies the information, denies the access, denies the transparency that’s needed, it is &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And you kind of expect that?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, let’s see.  Because &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>That’s been the history.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Mike, at the end of the day it’s profoundly in China’s interest to do this as well, because, look, it suffered too in the outbreak of this pandemic.  It presumably has an interest as well, especially if it purports to be a responsible international actor, to do everything it can to provide all the information it has to make sure we can hopefully prevent this from happening again.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>The Trump administration had a number of executive orders cracking down on people who were tied to the Chinese Communist Party – we’re talking about export bans.  How are you thinking about that and will you be tougher?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Look, I think the Trump administration was right to look at that.  And we’re &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And to act on it?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  And to act on it.  And we’re reviewing all of that as we speak.  And for example, it’s very important that we not – American companies or individuals – aid and abet, for example, China’s ability to use surveillance technology to repress its own people, or to export that technology to allow other autocratic or authoritarian governments from doing the same thing.  I think that’s very important.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Last stop on the tour, Russia.  With these cyber attacks, President Putin is thumbing his nose at the U.S. – blatant disrespect.  What is the U.S. going to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, what we’re going to do about it is to do what President Biden has already done, which is to make very clear &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  But it’s not working.  We’ve had our food supply threatened, we’ve had our energy supply threatened, now transportation threatened.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Look, there are – we would prefer to have a more stable, predictable relationship with Russia.  We’ve made that clear.  But we’ve made equally clear that if Russia chooses to act aggressively or recklessly toward us or toward our allies and partners, we’ll respond.</p>
<p>When it comes to these ransomware attacks, of course, we’ve already talked to the Russians about this.  One of the things we’re seeing is that criminal enterprises seem to be engaged in these attacks.  And it is an obligation on the part of any country, including Russia, if it has a criminal enterprise acting from its territory against anyone else, to do what’s necessary to stop it, to bring it to justice.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And yet, Mr. Secretary, Putin is clearly completely undeterred.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  One of the reasons that the President will be meeting with President Putin in a week’s time is not in spite of these aggressions, these attacks, it’s because of them, to tell him directly and clearly what he can expect from the United States if aggressive, reckless actions toward us continue.  Equally, though, to make clear that if Russia by its actions chooses a different course, we would prefer a more stable, predictable relationship.  There are things we can do together that would advance the security of our people, the Russian people, people around the world – strategic stability, arms control.  So we’re going to explore that.  We have to test the proposition, and the best way to do that is for the two presidents to meet face to face.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Are you optimistic that after that summit that there will be a, as you put it, “more stable” relationship?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  This is going to be a test of that proposition.  I can’t tell you whether I’m optimistic or not about the results of that test, but it’s important to do that.  And also, I don’t think we’re going to know after one meeting, but we’ll have some indications and we’ll see.  We’re prepared either way.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  What do you mean by prepared?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, as I said, we’re prepared if Russia chooses to continue reckless and aggressive action – we’re prepared to deal with that, as we have – on the other hand, if it chooses a different course, we’re prepared to engage.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty years ago, on June 5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on the first five cases of what later became known as AIDS. At that time, none of us could have imagined that AIDS would still be with us today or that it would have taken more than 32 million lives globally, including 700,000 in the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we honor the memory of these men, women, and children, many of whom we lost in the prime of their lives to this devastating disease. We also celebrate the more than 38 million people worldwide, including 1.2 million in the United States, who are bravely living with HIV.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States is proud of our longstanding partnership with countries and communities around the world toward ending the global AIDS epidemic. We continue to bring the very best of America to this effort – from groundbreaking scientific discovery and inspired activism to steadfast political leadership and deep diplomatic engagement.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With bipartisan support across presidential administrations and from the U.S. Congress for nearly two decades, the United States has invested more than $85 billion in the global AIDS response through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and as the leading donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.  This is the largest commitment ever by one country to address a single disease.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with our many partners, we have saved more than 20 million lives, prevented millions of HIV infections, and significantly accelerated progress toward achieving HIV epidemic control in more than 50 countries. PEPFAR now supports nearly 18.2 million people with lifesaving antiretroviral therapy – an additional one million in the past six months alone. PEPFAR investments also assist nearly 300,000 health care workers, 3,000 laboratories, 70,000 health care sites, and disease surveillance – strengthening country capacity and resilience to prevent, detect, and respond to other infectious disease threats, including COVID-19.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty years on, we must take this important moment to reflect, recommit, reenergize, and reengage. After decades of progress, our work is not yet finished. To complete this journey – one started by the courageous advocates who marched in the streets of New York City, San Francisco, and across America – we must come together as a nation and as a global community. It is time to end the HIV epidemic everywhere. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Gayle Smith, State Department Coordinator for Global COVID-19 Response and Health Security</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us and especially thanks for joining us on a Friday afternoon. We are really pleased to have with us today Gayle Smith, the State Department Coordinator for Global COVID-19 Response and Health Security. Gayle will be able to chat with us a bit about yesterday’s announcement and offer some context around it, and then she will be happy to take your questions. As a reminder, this is on the record, but the contents of this briefing are embargoed until the end of the call. So with that, I will turn over to Coordinator Smith.</p>
<p><strong>MS SMITH: </strong>Thank you, Ned. And thank you so much, everybody, for joining us. I’m just going to run through a little bit of the why, how, and who and a little bit on what comes next, and then happy to take your questions.</p>
<p>I mean, as for why we’re doing this, I think the President has articulated a very urgent need, which is ending the global pandemic, and as part of that tackling the problem that is that we’ve got a real challenge on the supply of vaccines against demand. It’s in our interest to do this. Our own health security is at risk, but it has – as has been said, I think thousands of times since this pandemic started, none of us is safe until all of us are safe.</p>
<p>I think another reason is that U.S. leadership matters. We’ve been in consultation with a number of countries around the world, and I think it makes a big difference when the U.S. steps up and leads and organizes other countries to join forces. One of the reasons we’re not doing this is to curry any political favor. Our goal is to end the pandemic and maximize the supply as quickly as we can.</p>
<p>As to how we’ve thought through this first tranche of 25 million doses – and I would remind you that this is part of an initial 80 million dose commitment announced by the President – first, we wanted to make sure that we could maximize global coverage in this first round given the breadth of the need and the requirements.</p>
<p>The second is to be able to address both surges and what I would call pre-surges. There are a number of countries that may have been doing well, but with the rise of variants or other problems, they’re seeing sudden upticks – some of the things we’ve seen here in the United States – and there is the great urgency to move.</p>
<p>And third, we wanted to be very responsive to the very large number of countries who have come to us about their needs for vaccines and also to our neighbors.</p>
<p>In terms of the allocation of the vaccines, we will do at least 75 percent through COVAX. COVAX is the largest vaccine delivery platform in the world. We know it well. They’re an important partner. It’s built on something called Gavi, the Global Vaccine Alliance, which the United States has supported for many, many years to be the primary delivery mechanism for childhood vaccines.</p>
<p>We have identified the countries we want these vaccines to go to, and we’ll work with COVAX to have them delivered. That’s roughly just over 6 million across Latin America including Caribbean, 7 million South and Southeast Asia, 5 million across Africa. The balance of 25 percent, we are likely to do bilaterally. It gives us greater flexibility. And again, as we’ve seen, there are a lot of pop-ups and flairs in this pandemic, and we want to be able to move vaccines on an urgent basis if needed.</p>
<p>What comes next – we will continue this three-part strategy to maximize supply, again, by doing this dose sharing – and again, we anticipate it will increase over the coming months; by working with and encouraging U.S. manufacturers to increase production, including by the last quarter if not earlier of this year and well into next year; and to also work on global vaccine production. The international architecture for vaccine production was built for a much smaller number of doses than the world demands now, and so we want to increase production in its capacity and in fact decentralize it so there are more places in the world manufacturing and able to distribute vaccines.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d remind you that this dose-sharing operation is nested in a much broader response by the United States Government which includes vaccine readiness and working with countries to make sure that their health systems can provide the services that are needed both to deal with the spread of the virus but also to deliver vaccines. Many of the humanitarian impacts of the pandemic, which have been acute all across the world, the systemic economic impacts – so we’re working on all of those fronts as well.</p>
<p>And we will be working very hard in the coming days as we are soon going into the G7 Summit. And we’ve been having very, very productive discussions with our partners there about our collective efforts to do as much as we possibly can to get global vaccine coverage and to bring this pandemic to an end.</p>
<p>So let me stop there, and happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Excellent. Operator, do you mind just repeating the instructions to ask a question?</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Sure. If you would like to ask a question on today’s call, please press 1 then 0. That command, again, 1 then 0.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Great. Let’s go to the line of David Brunnstrom.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, hi. Thank you very much for this. You mentioned just there the G7. New Zealand is hosting APEC, and I think that’s actually later on today. It’s been pushing APEC countries to remove tariffs on vaccines and products in the vaccine supply chain. I’m just wondering if the U.S. supports that.</p>
<p>And I also wondered if you could – when you talk about the decentralizing production capacity – and we know that the United States is going to be relaxing restrictions on export of raw materials – if you allow the export of raw materials to other countries, is that fully* the understanding that those countries will be producing for export rather than for their own domestic consumption? Many thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS SMITH:</strong> Those are really good questions, and I think two things. I mean, look, we need greater vaccine productive capacity even without a pandemic, so I think that’s quite important. I think our – certainly our hope would be that countries will produce – certainly they’re going to produce for themselves, but also to be able to export, because again, that’s been a real obstacle that has come up.</p>
<p>I have to confess I am not familiar with but will immediately look into New Zealand’s latest moves and can come back to you on our position on that.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’ll go to the line of Josh Wingrove.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you so much for doing this. Can you offer a little insight into the reiteration yesterday of the 80 million pledge? Should that be interpreted as confidence that the AstraZeneca doses will become available this month, or is the plan to make up the – what is quoted, a 55 million balance due, for lack of a better phrase, with those other authorized vaccines?</p>
<p><strong>MS SMITH:</strong> Yeah, good question. Our expectation and certainly hope is that we will get a clearance from the FDA. Given that that is a regulatory public health agency, we are not going to prejudice that at all and let them come forth with their determination. And then we’ll act on the basis of that. But I think what you heard from the President, the commitment to 80 million vaccines, our current expectation is that the balance after these 25 million will come from the AstraZeneca doses.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’ll go to the line of Nicole Gaouette.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you for doing this. Two questions. I’m wondering if you could talk us through how you arrived at that distribution – those numbers between Latin America, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>And the second part of my question is: When those remaining 55 million doses will be made available whether you have a sense whether they’ll all go to COVAX or whether you’ll also be holding some of those back to distribute bilaterally.</p>
<p><strong>MS SMITH:</strong> Good questions. The way we looked at the numbers (inaudible) – obviously, given the demand, this is a bit challenging. Obviously, we want to give a certain focus to our own hemisphere, and so on the Latin American side that made a big difference – Latin America and the Caribbean. But I think if you look at – we’ve got three regions covered and focused on, because as I said at the top, we want to start laying the ground for global coverage so that when we do the next tranche of shared vaccines, we will be adding another layer of global coverage and so on and so forth. So that’s number one.</p>
<p>Number two is there are a number of places where there are either surge conditions or pre-surge conditions. We’ve seen a spike – many of the countries that have been affected by the extraordinary surge in India, for example. And there are a number of cases there where if we move quickly – you want to make sure healthcare workers are covered and other things. And again, we are trying to be responsive, including to our neighbors. The important thing I’d note on the actual allocation is that, again, this is the first round. This is just the beginning. So as we share more doses, we anticipate having greater coverage.</p>
<p>As to the allocation of the next round, we will likely – I can’t say for certain – follow a similar model to this one, but we can come back to you, absolutely, on that when we’re ready to move on the next tranche. But this seems to be an effective and workable formula.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’ll go to the line of Patsy Widakuswara.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, yes. Thank you for taking my call and thank you for doing this briefing. Can you speak a little bit about – the administration has been saying that this is not going to be currying political favors, but can you speak a little bit about the branding of these vaccines? We saw some of the shipment that was going out to South Korea had American flags on them. Would there be similar kind of branding even for the shipment that’s going to COVAX?</p>
<p>And my second question is on vaccine patent waiver. We saw that the EU pushed a counterproposal saying that they don’t want to support the TRIPS waiver. Do you think the administration will be pushing for this at the G7? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS SMITH: </strong>Yeah, good question. I think on the branding side I think there’s a real difference between trying to curry political favor and letting countries know that assistance we may be providing is from the American people. I think those are two very different things. So I think people will know. The vaccines will convey that they are from the American people, and I think when vaccines start arriving in country our ambassadors and other staff will be there to greet them. So that’s – yes, that these come from the United States. That’s an important fact and I think people will be well aware of that.</p>
<p>On the EU position, our current position is as it has been, that we support the TRIPS waiver. As you know, the next step on that is very arduous text negotiations by a consensus-based organization which are being led by our U.S. Trade Representative. I suspect that these issues will come up at the G7, but I’m not able to tell you any more specifically on that. I expect, frankly – quite focused on the response to the pandemic in the main.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’ll go to the line of Carmen Paun.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you so much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could say from the 25 million first tranche how many of those are Moderna doses, how many are J&amp;J, and how many are Pfizer, and if you already have a timeline of when they are going to start being shipped out to countries. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS SMITH:</strong> Sure. So what these are – that’s a really good question. What these are is it’s a combination of vaccines from our own stocks. There will be multiple types of vaccines available. And what we will do is there’s a process of sort of matching vaccines to the vaccination program. In some countries they may have some amount of an initial vaccine. J&amp;J may be easier than a two-dose. So we will be working that through with COVAX and with partner countries.</p>
<p>In terms of the timing, we intend to move as quickly as possible. Delivering vaccines and donating vaccines isn’t quite as simple as putting them on plane and dropping them off. There are regulatory and legal procedures that have to be in true. Transporting vaccines, as we’ve seen in the United States, they are important and somewhat delicate medicaments we need to do very carefully. So we’ve got teams set up to do all of that, work through that as quickly as possible and kick off deliveries as soon as we can and to establish a regular cadence. But again, and importantly, there are steps that have to be gone through before we can start moving them, but we’ve already started the work on that.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’ll take a final question from the line of Doug Byun.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks for doing this. I wanted to ask a question about the shipment to South Korea. President Biden said in his joint press conference with President Jae-in that he would help – the United States would help inoculate 550,000 troops, South Korean troops, and apparently referring to active service members. But – and as a result, the United States sent 1.some million doses of J&amp;J vaccine to South Korea which arrived earlier today. But the thing is the South Korean FDA does not allow people under the age of 30 be inoculated with J&amp;J vaccine, so I was wondering if the United States knew about this South Korean FDA’s regulation regarding J&amp;J vaccine when he made the decision to provide J&amp;J instead of the other two types that you have here.</p>
<p><strong>MS SMITH:</strong> Yes, my understanding – and we may need to do a follow-up with you on this – on this question is that the way this has worked and the way these future deliveries will work is among the first initial steps are to understand what countries have approved which vaccines and then proceed from there through a number of regulatory and legal steps. I would be happy to work with my colleagues to get a more specific answer back to you on that.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, Gayle, thank you very much. Thank you very much, everyone, for tuning in and hope everyone has a wonderful weekend.</p>
<p><strong>MS SMITH:</strong> Thanks so much, everybody.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gayle Smith, State Department Coordinator for Global COVID-19 Response and Health Security</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us and especially thanks for joining us on a Friday afternoon. We are really pleased to have with us today Gayle Smith, the State Department Coordinator for Global COVID-19 Response and Health Security. Gayle will be able to chat with us a bit about yesterday’s announcement and offer some context around it, and then she will be happy to take your questions. As a reminder, this is on the record, but the contents of this briefing are embargoed until the end of the call. So with that, I will turn over to Coordinator Smith.</p>
<p><strong>MS SMITH: </strong>Thank you, Ned. And thank you so much, everybody, for joining us. I’m just going to run through a little bit of the why, how, and who and a little bit on what comes next, and then happy to take your questions.</p>
<p>I mean, as for why we’re doing this, I think the President has articulated a very urgent need, which is ending the global pandemic, and as part of that tackling the problem that is that we’ve got a real challenge on the supply of vaccines against demand. It’s in our interest to do this. Our own health security is at risk, but it has – as has been said, I think thousands of times since this pandemic started, none of us is safe until all of us are safe.</p>
<p>I think another reason is that U.S. leadership matters. We’ve been in consultation with a number of countries around the world, and I think it makes a big difference when the U.S. steps up and leads and organizes other countries to join forces. One of the reasons we’re not doing this is to curry any political favor. Our goal is to end the pandemic and maximize the supply as quickly as we can.</p>
<p>As to how we’ve thought through this first tranche of 25 million doses – and I would remind you that this is part of an initial 80 million dose commitment announced by the President – first, we wanted to make sure that we could maximize global coverage in this first round given the breadth of the need and the requirements.</p>
<p>The second is to be able to address both surges and what I would call pre-surges. There are a number of countries that may have been doing well, but with the rise of variants or other problems, they’re seeing sudden upticks – some of the things we’ve seen here in the United States – and there is the great urgency to move.</p>
<p>And third, we wanted to be very responsive to the very large number of countries who have come to us about their needs for vaccines and also to our neighbors.</p>
<p>In terms of the allocation of the vaccines, we will do at least 75 percent through COVAX. COVAX is the largest vaccine delivery platform in the world. We know it well. They’re an important partner. It’s built on something called Gavi, the Global Vaccine Alliance, which the United States has supported for many, many years to be the primary delivery mechanism for childhood vaccines.</p>
<p>We have identified the countries we want these vaccines to go to, and we’ll work with COVAX to have them delivered. That’s roughly just over 6 million across Latin America including Caribbean, 7 million South and Southeast Asia, 5 million across Africa. The balance of 25 percent, we are likely to do bilaterally. It gives us greater flexibility. And again, as we’ve seen, there are a lot of pop-ups and flairs in this pandemic, and we want to be able to move vaccines on an urgent basis if needed.</p>
<p>What comes next – we will continue this three-part strategy to maximize supply, again, by doing this dose sharing – and again, we anticipate it will increase over the coming months; by working with and encouraging U.S. manufacturers to increase production, including by the last quarter if not earlier of this year and well into next year; and to also work on global vaccine production. The international architecture for vaccine production was built for a much smaller number of doses than the world demands now, and so we want to increase production in its capacity and in fact decentralize it so there are more places in the world manufacturing and able to distribute vaccines.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d remind you that this dose-sharing operation is nested in a much broader response by the United States Government which includes vaccine readiness and working with countries to make sure that their health systems can provide the services that are needed both to deal with the spread of the virus but also to deliver vaccines. Many of the humanitarian impacts of the pandemic, which have been acute all across the world, the systemic economic impacts – so we’re working on all of those fronts as well.</p>
<p>And we will be working very hard in the coming days as we are soon going into the G7 Summit. And we’ve been having very, very productive discussions with our partners there about our collective efforts to do as much as we possibly can to get global vaccine coverage and to bring this pandemic to an end.</p>
<p>So let me stop there, and happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Excellent. Operator, do you mind just repeating the instructions to ask a question?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Jalina Porter, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:06 p.m. EST</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Good afternoon and thank you so much for joining today’s briefing. I just have one announcement at the top, and then we will resume taking questions.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-AFGHANISTAN"></a> As a part of our continued U.S. support for the people of Afghanistan, Secretary Blinken announced today that the United States is providing more than $266 million in new humanitarian assistance, bringing the total U.S. humanitarian aid for Afghanistan to nearly $3.9 billion since 2002.</p>
<p>For many years, the United States has prioritized support for Afghan returnees, refugees, displaced persons, and other vulnerable populations. This assistance from the American people will allow our partners to provide lifesaving protection, shelter, livelihood opportunities, health care, emergency food aid, water, sanitation, and hygiene services.<a id="post-249509-_Hlk73693778"></a></p>
<p>As the United States withdraws forces from Afghanistan, we will continue to support the peaceful, stable future of – the Afghan people want and deserve, and using our full diplomatic, economic, and assistance toolkit.</p>
<p>We urge the Taliban and Afghan leaders to accelerate progress toward negotiated political settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to bring an end to more than 40 years of conflict and create the conditions that will allow refugees to return to their homes safely.</p>
<p>And we’ll start taking your questions in just one minute.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Cindy Saine.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, hello. Thank you so much. My Afghan service colleagues are asking whether this new assistance is brand new or whether it was part of the previously announced $300 million. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Cindy. This – again, to reiterate the announcement at the top, this is new funding, and this funding, to just be a little bit more specific, includes $157.5 million from USAID and also $109 million from the State Department. So that will bring our total from Fiscal Year 2020 and 2021 humanitarian assistance to more than 534 – I’m sorry, $543 million. And again, this totals $3.9 billion since 2002.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Simon Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. Thanks, Jalina. I have a question on Iran. We’re reporting that the U.S., Britain, France, and Germany are not going to seek a resolution – a Board of Governors’ resolution at the IAEA Board of Governors next week over Iran’s failure to explain uranium traces at three sites. Can you confirm that and tell us why?</p>
<p>And if the Iranians fail to explain these – the Iranians fail to explain these uranium traces, why should you trust them to adhere to the terms of a renewed JCPOA agreement, assuming you can get one? And are you going easy on them over this in hopes of securing a new deal? Thanks.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-IRAN"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Simon. So for your first question, I’m not able to comment on that from here and would have to refer you back to the IAEA. But again, as you know, these talks are ongoing, and again, we’ll continue to underscore that to enable a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA commitments, we’d like to build on the meaningful process that we’ve achieved and keep on doing that moving forward. Other than that, I don’t have anything else to announce.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Said Arikat.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Jalina, for taking my question. Very quickly, Jalina, Secretary of State Antony Blinken met today with Palestinian Americans. Can you share with us the topics he discussed with them and what kind of commitment he may have made or reiterated a U.S. commitment to help the Palestinians?</p>
<p>And second, I also wanted to ask about the ongoing sort of horrible situation in Gaza in terms of medicines, in terms of the people leaving or being allowed to leave the strip. Thank you very kindly.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-MEP"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> I think if I still have you, number one, I’ll answer your first question quickly. I can confirm the meeting, but I don’t have any other details to preview on the details of the meeting. But if I still have you, Said, can you repeat your first – your second question? Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> My second question, the situation has not – and despite there has been a ceasefire for the past, whatever, almost two weeks or close to that, two weeks, yes, in terms of patients who are in need of desperate health care and so on being allowed through the crossings into Israel, and to the West Bank, and to Egypt, and so on. So what is the administration doing in terms of either pressuring Egypt and Israel to allow the Gaza patients in and out? Thank you.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, thank you for holding. So what I would say to that is that we’re certainly not going to get ahead of the process that’s underway. And any other details we have to preview, we’ll be able to share those at a later time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Jiha Ham.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And their line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Jalina. So the U.S. is sharing 25 million vaccine doses worldwide, but the administration has no plans to share vaccines with the DPRK. I’m wondering if it is because simply there is no such request from North Korea, or it is just because there is a political decision you have made not to share the vaccines with countries like North Korea.</p>
<p>And my second question, if I may, the South Korean Government reiterated its commitment or willingness to resume its tourism project with North Korea. Could you tell us how you view on this? Is tourism between the two Koreas subject to U.S. or international sanctions? Thank you.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-DPRK"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Jiha. So to your – to answer your first question, no specific comment on any asks from the DPRK. But what I will say is that the United States and this administration has been priding itself as being a leader in vaccine diplomacy.</p>
<p>To your second question, we certainly have no comment from here on that either.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Rosiland Jordan.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And their line is open. And Rosiland Jordan, if you’re on mute &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, we can hear you now.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, sorry about that. I see that the Secretary is scheduled to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee next week to testify about the proposed coming fiscal year budget. Are there particular items in the budget that the Secretary is really going to defend, especially since there is a pronounced anti-foreign aid component among congressional Republicans? And if so, how is he going to make the best case for defending that funding?</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-DEPT"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you for the question, Rosiland. So, of course, we can confirm that the Secretary will be testifying on the Hill next week, but we certainly won’t be able to get ahead of his testimony or preview anything from here today.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Hiba Nasr.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thank you, Jalina, for taking my question. I want to ask a question about Lebanon. The start of the trial of the Ayyash case at a special tribunal for Lebanon has been cancelled due to insufficient funding. And the tribunal itself will have to close if it is unable to solve the funding problem. Do you have any comment on that, especially that the U.S. offered $10 million for information on Ayyash?</p>
<p>And I have one more question on Iran: Do we expect anything or a significant announcement before the Iranian election?</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-IRANLEBANON"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>So to your question on Iran, we don’t have any announcements to make at this time. And to your question on Lebanon, we’re going to have to take that one back for you today.</p>
<p>Let’s go to (inaudible). My apologies if I pronounced your name incorrectly.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>You did great. Thank you so much, pronouncing (inaudible). Thank you so much for taking my call. I am just going to – regarding – I’m going to ask you regarding the current situation – as you know that Ethiopia – the Ethiopian Government just put out a statement this past weekend – I mean a week ago – for the situation that they going to have a second case for military movements or military action in Tigray. So what’s your assessment of the current situation? Are you still waiting for the Eritreans also to withdraw from Tigray region? And what’s the current situation in term of the overall on your assessment? Thank you so much.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-ETHIOPIA"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>So thank you for your question. So what I can say at a broad level is that of course the United States has concerns about the crisis in the Tigray region, of course, as well as other threats to both the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ethiopia. The people in Tigray continue to suffer human rights violations, various abuses, atrocities, and urgently need humanitarian relief that is being blocked by the Ethiopian and Eritrean militaries as well as other armed actors. And, of course, the parties – despite any significant diplomatic engagement, we call on the parties to the conflict in Tigray that have no meaningful steps or – to end the hostility, to pursue a peaceful resolution to the political crisis.</p>
<p>Let’s take our last question from Pearl Matibe.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Hello, Jalina, and thank you so much for taking my question. Happy Friday. I’m wondering now that we are almost exactly 30 days or a month away from July 4th, the United States celebrates its independence. And given your foreign policy, looking at your domestic policy that determines your foreign policy, where do you think you are at now this number of days into President Biden’s administration? How can you – how are you assessing – what are the indicators that you are succeeding in this new foreign policy approach? Maybe if you can share something about that.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-DEPT2"></a><strong>MS PORTER: </strong>Thank you for your question, Pearl. So as you noted, we are 30 days away from July 4th, but at the same time President Biden has also already previewed all the accomplishments that our administration has made within the first 100 days, so I would have to guide you back to his remarks that he made to the public that day and any other remarks on the administration at a wider level to the White House.</p>
<p>That concludes today’s briefing. Thank you all so much for joining, and I hope you have a great weekend ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:25 p.m.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jalina Porter, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:06 p.m. EST</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Good afternoon and thank you so much for joining today’s briefing. I just have one announcement at the top, and then we will resume taking questions.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-AFGHANISTAN"></a> As a part of our continued U.S. support for the people of Afghanistan, Secretary Blinken announced today that the United States is providing more than $266 million in new humanitarian assistance, bringing the total U.S. humanitarian aid for Afghanistan to nearly $3.9 billion since 2002.</p>
<p>For many years, the United States has prioritized support for Afghan returnees, refugees, displaced persons, and other vulnerable populations. This assistance from the American people will allow our partners to provide lifesaving protection, shelter, livelihood opportunities, health care, emergency food aid, water, sanitation, and hygiene services.<a id="post-249509-_Hlk73693778"></a></p>
<p>As the United States withdraws forces from Afghanistan, we will continue to support the peaceful, stable future of – the Afghan people want and deserve, and using our full diplomatic, economic, and assistance toolkit.</p>
<p>We urge the Taliban and Afghan leaders to accelerate progress toward negotiated political settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to bring an end to more than 40 years of conflict and create the conditions that will allow refugees to return to their homes safely.</p>
<p>And we’ll start taking your questions in just one minute.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Cindy Saine.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, hello. Thank you so much. My Afghan service colleagues are asking whether this new assistance is brand new or whether it was part of the previously announced $300 million. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Cindy. This – again, to reiterate the announcement at the top, this is new funding, and this funding, to just be a little bit more specific, includes $157.5 million from USAID and also $109 million from the State Department. So that will bring our total from Fiscal Year 2020 and 2021 humanitarian assistance to more than 534 – I’m sorry, $543 million. And again, this totals $3.9 billion since 2002.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Simon Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> And your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. Thanks, Jalina. I have a question on Iran. We’re reporting that the U.S., Britain, France, and Germany are not going to seek a resolution – a Board of Governors’ resolution at the IAEA Board of Governors next week over Iran’s failure to explain uranium traces at three sites. Can you confirm that and tell us why?</p>
<p>And if the Iranians fail to explain these – the Iranians fail to explain these uranium traces, why should you trust them to adhere to the terms of a renewed JCPOA agreement, assuming you can get one? And are you going easy on them over this in hopes of securing a new deal? Thanks.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-IRAN"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Simon. So for your first question, I’m not able to comment on that from here and would have to refer you back to the IAEA. But again, as you know, these talks are ongoing, and again, we’ll continue to underscore that to enable a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA commitments, we’d like to build on the meaningful process that we’ve achieved and keep on doing that moving forward. Other than that, I don’t have anything else to announce.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Said Arikat.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Jalina, for taking my question. Very quickly, Jalina, Secretary of State Antony Blinken met today with Palestinian Americans. Can you share with us the topics he discussed with them and what kind of commitment he may have made or reiterated a U.S. commitment to help the Palestinians?</p>
<p>And second, I also wanted to ask about the ongoing sort of horrible situation in Gaza in terms of medicines, in terms of the people leaving or being allowed to leave the strip. Thank you very kindly.</p>
<p><a id="post-249509-MEP"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> I think if I still have you, number one, I’ll answer your first question quickly. I can confirm the meeting, but I don’t have any other details to preview on the details of the meeting. But if I still have you, Said, can you repeat your first – your second question? Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> My second question, the situation has not – and despite there has been a ceasefire for the past, whatever, almost two weeks or close to that, two weeks, yes, in terms of patients who are in need of desperate health care and so on being allowed through the crossings into Israel, and to the West Bank, and to Egypt, and so on. So what is the administration doing in terms of either pressuring Egypt and Israel to allow the Gaza patients in and out? Thank you.</p>
