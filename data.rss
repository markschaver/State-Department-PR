					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the European Union, as members of the Friends of Sudan, welcome the publication by the UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) of its summary report on consultations with Sudanese stakeholders, against the backdrop of Sudan’s ongoing political crisis.</p>
<p>The active engagement of a wide range of Sudanese stakeholders in the consultations, including those representing women, youth, and other groups and regions is a strong and encouraging sign of the actors’ unwavering commitment to resolving the political crisis and to paving the way for a democratic and peaceful Sudan. The report reflects their views and demonstrates strong consensus on a number of key issues and principles, including: installation of a transitional cabinet of civilian technocrats; reduction in the size and powers of the transitional Sovereign Council; establishment of a transitional Legislative Assembly composed of civilians; the equitable participation of women in the transitional institutions; the importance of transitional justice and accountability; and the need to establish new electoral laws and bodies which can deliver free and fair elections.</p>
<p>The areas of consensus provide an important basis for further efforts by all Sudanese parties to find a common understanding on the way forward, by agreeing on a new constitutional and legal basis and governance arrangements for the remaining transitional period, pending credible elections. These efforts must remain Sudanese-owned and –led, and we welcome the commitment of UNITAMS, the African Union, and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, as well as the EU, the League of Arab States, and Friends of Sudan, to work together to support the process.</p>
<p>The UNITAMS report also notes overwhelming consensus on the need to build a conducive environment for a political process, by stopping violence and killings in the context of protests, lifting the State of Emergency, ending unjust detentions, ceasing attacks on hospitals, and respecting rights to free expression and peaceful assembly.</p>
<p>The Friends of Sudan call on all relevant Sudanese stakeholders to engage in the next phase of a political process to resolve the political crisis in Sudan. We remain committed to supporting the aspirations of the Sudanese people for a free, democratic, peaceful, and prosperous Sudan.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>On February 26, 2022, Ukraine filed an application at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to initiate proceedings against the Russian Federation under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Ukraine seeks to address Russia’s groundless claims that genocide has occurred in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts of Ukraine and establish that Russia has no lawful basis to take military action on the basis of those false claims. Ukraine has also requested the ICJ exercise its authority to indicate provisional measures to preserve Ukraine’s rights and limit the ongoing and irreparable harm to the Ukrainian people as well as Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.</p>
<p>As the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, the ICJ has a vital role to play in the peaceful settlement of disputes. Ukraine also requested the Court call upon Russia to halt immediately all military actions in Ukraine pending the Court’s review. Today, in response to that request, the Court called on the Russian Federation to act in a manner that would allow any provisional measures ordered by the Court to have an actual impact. This is another clear indication that Russia must cease its military activities in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Considering the gravity of the crisis in Ukraine that has resulted from Russia’s unprovoked invasion, we trust the Court is taking into consideration the dire circumstances and rapidly unfolding events and hope that it will act with utmost urgency on Ukraine’s request for provisional measures.</p>
<p>Each day that Russia is unconstrained in its aggression is a day that brings more violence, suffering, death, and destruction in Ukraine. The United States stands with the people of Ukraine.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State submitted the 2022 edition of the annual International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) to Congress today. This two-volume, Congressionally-mandated report assesses foreign governments’ efforts to reduce illicit drug production, trafficking, and use as well as their work to counter drug trafficking-related money laundering. The INCSR was first published in 1986, and this edition covers calendar year 2021.</p>
<p>This year’s INCSR stresses that the opioid crisis remains a global challenge that requires urgent international action. Synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, continue to claim far too many lives in the United States and represent a growing global threat. The report highlights not only increases in trafficking and abuse of fentanyl and other deadly synthetic opioids across the globe but also concerning levels of overseas production of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. Reducing the global drug threat will require sustained political commitments from partner governments, supported by U.S. assistance, to target all the links in the supplier-to-consumer chain. This means curbing the production of illicit drugs, interdicting drug shipments, tackling illicit finance, and reducing drug demand everywhere.</p>
<p>Volume I of the INCSR, addressing Drugs and Chemical Control, provides an overview of 2021 drug control efforts undertaken by 63 countries. Volume II, Money Laundering, highlights the nature of drug trafficking-related money laundering – and specific vulnerabilities – in 80 countries and jurisdictions as well as these governments’ efforts to strengthen their anti-money laundering regimes.</p>
<p>The full text of INCSR Volumes I and II can be viewed at <a href="https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-international-narcotics-and-law-enforcement-affairs-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-international-narcotics-and-law-enforcement-affairs-releases/</a>.</p>
