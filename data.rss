					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p align="left">The United States is committed to the responsible development and design of digital assets and the technology that underpins new forms of payments and capital flows in the international financial system.  Today’s Executive Order (E.O.) on “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets” demonstrates our determination to lead and shape financial innovation to promote prosperity, prevent abuse, and advance democratic values.</p>
<p align="left">Financial innovation can produce great benefit for society, but it needs the right guardrails to prevent harm.  During the Russian government’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war on Ukraine, we have seen it employed for ill and for good.  For instance, there have been numerous ransomware incidents using cryptocurrencies that have originated in Russia, as have other malicious cyber activities.  On the other hand, people from around the world have responded to Ukraine’s request for assistance by making direct donations through cryptocurrencies.  Today’s E.O. is designed to block the former and promote the latter.</p>
<p align="left">The Department of State will play an important role in the implementation of this E.O.  Our embassies and missions around the world are ready to partner with the private sector and international bodies to support the development and use of digital asset technology in ways aligned with U.S. values.  This will include fostering international cooperation and U.S. competitiveness; reducing the risks that digital assets could pose to consumers, investors, businesses, and the environment; supporting the development and adoption of standards; protecting the integrity and stability of the financial system; preserving interoperability; combating corruption; preventing crime and illicit finance; protecting against arbitrary or unlawful surveillance; defending privacy and the exercise of human rights; and supporting financial inclusion.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p align="left">The United States is designating former Ecuadorian President Abdalá Jaime Bucaram Ortiz, Sr. due to his involvement in significant corruption, including misappropriation of public funds, accepting bribes, and interfering with public processes.  During his tenure as the president of Ecuador, Bucaram engaged in multiple corrupt acts, including accepting bribes and stealing public funds.  Former President Bucaram has not yet faced accountability for his betrayal of the public trust.</p>
<p align="left">This public designation is made under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2021, as carried forward by the Continued Appropriations Act, 2022.  Under this authority, designated officials of foreign governments involved in significant corruption and their immediate family members are ineligible for entry into the United States.  The Department is also designating Bucaram’s spouse, María Rosa Pulley Vergara, and sons Jacobo Abdalá Bucaram Pulley, Abdalá Jaime Bucaram Pulley, and Michel Abdalá Bucaram Pulley.</p>
<p align="left">This designation reaffirms the commitment of the United States to combat corruption that undermines the Ecuadorian people’s faith in its democratic institutions.  We stand with all Ecuadorians in support of democracy and the rule of law and against those who undermine these principles for personal gain.</p>

<p>Today, Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights Uzra Zeya and Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Strategy, Policy, and Plans Robert Silvers co-hosted a roundtable discussion with members of U.S. and other diaspora communities who have been targeted by transnational repression efforts by foreign governments and other foreign actors.  Participants shared their often harrowing experiences and described the far-reaching, negative consequences of transnational repression on their lives and those of their family members.  They also provided insights into how authoritarian regimes in particular seek to intimidate into silence perceived dissidents, activists, journalists, or vulnerable groups located abroad, and exact reprisals against them.</p>
<p>Under Secretary Zeya and Under Secretary Silvers reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to stand with and support the human rights defenders, journalists, activists, and others targeted by transnational repression, and to continue to promote accountability for perpetrators of transnational repression.  They underscored the Biden-Harris Administration’s resolve to push back against governments that threaten and attack individuals, both at home and abroad, who are peacefully exercising their universal human rights.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is deeply concerned by Guatemalan Attorney General Consuelo Porras’ continued, brazen attacks on Guatemala’s justice system through politically motivated arrests and detentions of current and former public servants fighting corruption. The reports of repeated, uncommon delays in arraignment hearings, the withholding of information to defense counsels, refusals to hold hearings publicly, and leaks of sealed case details to online entities raise serious concerns regarding the fairness of these proceedings. In addition to the arrest of at least six former and current anti-corruption prosecutors, other prosecutors have been forced to flee the country and efforts continue to remove the immunity of additional anti-corruption judges and prosecutors. We are also alarmed that procedural delays often place public servants in the same facilities with those they have helped investigate or convict, leading to serious risks to their safety.</p>
<p>The United States calls on the Government of Guatemala to respect the human rights of all individuals, including by guaranteeing fair trials and ensuring the personal safety and fair and transparent treatment of all justice sector actors. The Attorney General’s efforts to target anticorruption and other prosecutors follow a disturbing trend of corruption and the weakening of democratic institutions and processes in Guatemala.</p>
