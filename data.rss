					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>At today’s sixth Brussels Conference on “Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region,” Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. Representative to the United Nations, announced nearly $808 million in new humanitarian assistance to respond to the crisis in Syria. This funding brings total U.S. government humanitarian assistance since the start of the 11-year crisis to nearly $15 billion.  U.S. assistance will benefit many of the 14.6 million Syrians inside Syria in need of humanitarian assistance, as well as 5.6 million Syrian refugees and host communities in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt.</p>
<p>Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield also stressed the need for Syrian authorities to provide unhindered humanitarian access to all Syrians in need and for the international community to support the provision of assistance through all avenues available, including through cross-border and cross-line assistance.  The UN cross-border aid mechanism is a lifeline for millions of Syrians for which there is no substitute. It must be re-authorized and expanded.</p>
<p>We continue to express our gratitude for the continued generosity of host countries and reiterated United States’ commitment to supporting the Syrian people and the communities that host them.  All refugee returns must be voluntary, safe, and dignified.</p>
<p>The Syrian people continue to face innumerable atrocities, and we support justice and accountability for ongoing human rights violations and abuses. The systemic corruption and economic mismanagement of the Assad regime have further prevented the Syrian people from meeting their basic needs.  Humanitarian needs in Syria and the region are greater than at any other time since the start of the conflict.  We urge donors to support the Syrian people by increasing contributions to both emergency assistance and early recovery to more efficiently and effectively address the humanitarian needs in Syria.</p>
<p>Along with our allies and partners, the United States supports UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen’s efforts to achieve a political settlement and permanent resolution to the Syrian conflict in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254.  There is no military solution that will bring peace, security, and stability to Syria and the region.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is committed to Indigenous-led conservation.  Tribal and Indigenous communities have been the original stewards of land, waters, and wildlife since time immemorial.  Many of the major milestones in protecting ocean areas under the jurisdiction of the United States resulted from the leadership of Tribes and Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>As part of these continuing efforts, the United States is pleased to highlight a suite of Indigenous-led initiatives within its overall commitment package at the Our Ocean Conference 2022 held April 13-14 and co-hosted by the United States and Palau.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The United States Announced the Initiation of Three National Marine Sanctuary Designations: </b>The United States is working with local communities, Indigenous Peoples, and states on the potential designation of three new national marine sanctuaries (NMS), including the proposed Chumash Heritage NMS, the proposed Lake Ontario NMS, as well as providing additional protection to Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument by designating it as a national marine sanctuary.<b></b></li>
<li><b>The United States Announced the Establishment and Development of the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area </b>(NBSCRA)<b>: </b>President Biden re-established the NBSCRA on his first day in office. Implementation will proceed on the basis of a unique partnership between the U.S. federal government and Indigenous Peoples of the region through the joint work of the Task Force and Tribal Advisory Council, in recognition of Tribal sovereignty and self-governance, and will include Indigenous Knowledge in decision-making.<b></b></li>
<li><b>The United States Announced the Signing of an Indo-Pacific Marine Protected Area (MPA) Partnership with the Republic of Palau: </b>The United States has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Republic of Palau to collaborate on and strengthen the conservation, management, and engagement of marine protected areas in the Pacific Islands Region, establishing a Sister Site Agreement between the National Marine Sanctuary of American Samoa and the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, as well as a framework for broader Indo-Pacific regional cooperation on MPA issues.<b></b></li>
<li><b>The United States Announced That It Will Launch a Working Group or Commission to Evaluate Naming Practices for Existing and Future Marine National Monuments and National Marine Sanctuaries:</b> The United States will launch a working group or commission to evaluate naming practices for existing and future marine national monuments and national marine sanctuaries, with particular emphasis on the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument.<b></b></li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States is joining with allies and partners to condemn Russia’s destructive cyber activities against Ukraine.  In the months leading up to and after Russia’s illegal further invasion began, Ukraine experienced a series of disruptive cyber operations, including website defacements, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and cyber attacks to delete data from computers belonging to government and private entities – all part of the Russian playbook.  For example, the United States has assessed that Russian military cyber operators have deployed multiple families of destructive wiper malware, including WhisperGate, on Ukrainian Government and private sector networks.  These disruptive cyber operations began in January 2022, prior to Russia&#8217;s illegal further invasion of Ukraine and have continued throughout the war.</p>
<p>Today, in support of the European Union and other partners, the United States is sharing publicly its assessment that Russia launched cyber attacks in late February against commercial satellite communications networks to disrupt Ukrainian command and control during the invasion, and those actions had spillover impacts into other European countries.  The activity disabled very small aperture terminals in Ukraine and across Europe.  This includes tens of thousands of terminals outside of Ukraine that, among other things, support wind turbines and provide Internet services to private citizens.</p>
<p>As nations committed to upholding the rules-based international order in cyberspace, the United States and its allies and partners are taking steps to defend against Russia’s irresponsible actions. The U.S. Government has developed new mechanisms to help Ukraine identify cyber threats and recover from cyber incidents. We have also enhanced our support for Ukraine’s digital connectivity, including by providing satellite phones and data terminals to Ukrainian government officials, essential service providers, and critical infrastructure operators. We praise Ukraine’s efforts—both in and outside of government—to defend against and recover from such activity, even as its country is under physical attack.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Leading up to and during Russia’s unprovoked and illegal further invasion of Ukraine, the United States is supporting Ukraine’s continued access to the Internet and to enhance Ukraine’s cyber defenses. These efforts, coordinated across the U.S. government, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has provided direct support to its Ukrainian national security and law enforcement partners, including briefing Ukrainian partners on Russian intelligence services’ cyber operations; sharing cyber threat information about potential or ongoing malicious cyber activity; helping to disrupt nation-state efforts to spread disinformation and target the Ukrainian government and military; and sharing investigative methods and cyber incident response best practices. The FBI also has received threat intelligence and leads from its Ukrainian partners for action using the FBI’s unique investigative and intelligence capabilities.  FBI, State, and other U.S. government agencies have also assisted Ukraine with identifying and procuring hardware and software to support network defense.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Technical experts funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) are providing hands-on support to essential service providers within the Ukrainian government including government ministries and critical infrastructure operators to identify malware and restore systems after an incident has occurred. This support builds on long standing USAID support building cyber resilience among regional utilities, particularly in the energy sector.  USAID and the Department of State are also exploring new mechanisms to leverage the services offered by U.S. and Ukrainian cybersecurity service providers to support and reinforce the Government of Ukraine’s own cyber defense efforts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>USAID has provided more than 6,750 emergency communications devices, including satellite phones and data terminals, to essential service providers, government officials, and critical infrastructure operators in key sectors such as energy and telecommunications.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Department of Energy (DOE) and other interagency partners are working with Ukraine on efforts related to further integrating Ukraine’s electrical grid with the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), including meeting cybersecurity requirements and enhancing the resilience of its energy sector. Full ENTSO-E integration is key to protecting Ukraine’s financial, energy, and national security.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has exchanged technical information on cybersecurity threats related to Russia’s unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine with key partners, including Ukraine. On February 26, CISA issued <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-057a">an alert</a> providing technical details and mitigation guidance on destructive malware targeting organizations in Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Prior to February 2022, the U.S. government worked closely with Ukrainian government ministries and critical infrastructure sectors to support Ukraine’s cyber resilience, including by providing over $40 million in cyber capacity development assistance since 2017. Among these efforts:
<ul>
<li>Beginning in 2020, USAID launched an ambitious $38 million cybersecurity reform program that will work over the next several years to strengthen Ukraine’s cybersecurity legal and regulatory environment, build Ukraine’s cyber workforce and strengthen course offerings at leading Ukrainian universities, and develop connections between critical infrastructure operators and private sector solution providers. This program has embedded more than 20 technical experts within the Government of Ukraine to bolster Ukraine&#8217;s cyber response and recovery capabilities, and deployed cybersecurity software and hardware tools to ensure the resilience of critical infrastructure to physical and cyber attacks.</li>
<li>DOE has a long-standing relationship with the energy sector in Ukraine, including work with Ukrainian utilities to help enhance their cybersecurity posture. In the leadup to Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine, DOE, leveraging the expertise of our National Labs, worked with utilities to focus on potential near-term cybersecurity enhancements, while also continuing our work on long-term resilience efforts.</li>
<li>The Treasury Department has worked with the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), via the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), to support NBU’s Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to improve cybersecurity information sharing in Ukraine’s financial services sector. Leading up to Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine, Treasury offered NBU assistance on specific cybersecurity issues while continuing to work on longer-term cybersecurity projects to better ensure the cyber resilience of Ukraine’s financial sector.</li>
<li>From December 2021 to February 2022, cyber experts from U.S. Cyber Command conducted defensive cyber operations alongside Ukrainian Cyber Command personnel, as part of a wider effort to increase cyber resilience in critical networks. Cyber professionals from both countries sat side by side, looking for adversary activity and identifying vulnerabilities.  In addition to this effort, the team provided remote analytic and advisory support aligned to critical networks from outside Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The U.S. government’s efforts, closely coordinated with private sector and international partners, support Ukraine’s network defenders and telecommunications professionals, who continue to defend Ukrainian networks and repair infrastructure, often at direct risk to their lives.  The United States condemns actions that block or degrade access to the Internet in Ukraine, which sever critical channels for sharing and learning information, including about the war.</p>

<p>Leading up to and during Russia’s unprovoked and illegal further invasion of Ukraine, the United States is supporting Ukraine’s continued access to the Internet and to enhance Ukraine’s cyber defenses. These efforts, coordinated across the U.S. government, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has provided direct support to its Ukrainian national security and law enforcement partners, including briefing Ukrainian partners on Russian intelligence services’ cyber operations; sharing cyber threat information about potential or ongoing malicious cyber activity; helping to disrupt nation-state efforts to spread disinformation and target the Ukrainian government and military; and sharing investigative methods and cyber incident response best practices. The FBI also has received threat intelligence and leads from its Ukrainian partners for action using the FBI’s unique investigative and intelligence capabilities.  FBI, State, and other U.S. government agencies have also assisted Ukraine with identifying and procuring hardware and software to support network defense.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States reiterates its strong support for the combined efforts of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS), the African Union (AU), and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) to facilitate a political process to restore a civilian-led transition to democracy in Sudan.  We welcome the outreach and progress made to date.</p>
<p>As the process moves forward and the facilitators begin conversations with stakeholders on the substance of a solution, we are convinced that the UNITAMS-AU-IGAD facilitated process is the most inclusive mechanism to achieve an urgently needed agreement on a civilian-led transitional framework.  We continue to encourage all Sudanese civilian and military actors to utilize this process to achieve democratic progress and national stability.</p>
<p>In recent phone calls with Sudanese civilian and military leaders, Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Molly Phee welcomed the release of political detainees in the past few weeks.  At the same time, she pressed for the full implementation of promised confidence-building measures by the Sudanese military including lifting the state of emergency and the release of the remaining political detainees.  She stressed the need for all stakeholders to participate constructively in the UNITAMS-AU-IGAD facilitated process and to make rapid progress on the framework for a civilian transitional government.  She underscored the need for the military to transfer power to a civilian government established under such a framework to enable the resumption of international financial support and development assistance.</p>
