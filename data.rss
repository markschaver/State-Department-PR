					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Joining me now is U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Thank you so much for joining me this morning.  So I want to start with those horrific images and reports from Bucha.  What is your reaction?  And do you see evidence here of crimes against humanity?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Dana, you can’t help but see these images as a punch to the gut.  And look, we’ve said before Russia’s aggression that we thought it was likely that they would commit atrocities.  Since the aggression, we’ve come out and said that we believe that Russian forces have committed war crimes and we’ve been working to document that, to provide the information that we have to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together, and there needs to be accountability for it.</p>
<p>But I think the most important thing is we can’t become numb to this.  We can’t normalize this.  This is the reality of what’s going on every single day as long as Russia’s brutality against Ukraine continues.  That’s why it needs to come to an end.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And the Ukrainian foreign minister said Russia aims to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can.  Beyond war crimes, do you see this as genocide?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Look, we will look hard and document everything that we see, put it all together, make sure that the relevant institutions and organizations that are looking at this – including the State Department – have everything they need to assess exactly what took place in Ukraine, who’s responsible, and what it amounts to.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Let’s talk about the punishment here.  The EU is already saying it will impose new, even harsher sanctions over this.  What about the U.S.?  Would the U.S. impose more sanctions, for example, on Russian oil, cracking down on all Russian banks, banning energy payments from the SWIFT banking system?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Dana, we’re doing this every single day.  We’re tightening the existing sanctions.  We’re adding new ones.  We’re doing it in full coordination with Europeans and other partners around the world.  And one of the results is that the Russian economy is reeling.  There are forecasts by most of the major forecasters that its economy is going to contract by 10 percent this year, and that’s in stark contrast to economies like our own, which are growing rapidly.  We’re seeing an exodus of every major company from Russia.  And over the long term, the export controls that we’ve imposed means that they will not have the technology they need to modernize key aspects of their economy and their future.</p>
<p>So these sanctions are having a big bite now, they’re going to have a big bite going forward as long as this lasts, and we are every single day making sure that they’re not only tightened, but increased.  We announced additional sanctions just a couple of days ago.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  They still have a lifeline, particularly when it comes to their energy sector.  Is that something that the U.S. is considering along with its Western allies?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We’re in constant conversation with allies and partners about the most effective ways to tighten, to strengthen the sanctions, and at the same time, we’re very focused on making sure that Europe has the energy it needs not only to get through this year and this winter, which it has, but next year as well.  But the other thing, Dana, is this:  If you step back and look at this, this has already been a dramatic strategic setback for Russia and, I would say, a strategic defeat.</p>
<p>They had three aims going into this.  One was to subjugate Ukraine to Russia’s will, to take away its sovereignty and independence.  The second was to assert Russian power.  The third was to divide the West and NATO.  On all three fronts, it’s already lost.  Ukraine, its sovereignty and independence, is going to be there a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is going to be on the scene.  The Russian military has dramatically underperformed.  Its economy is reeling.  And the West, NATO, are more united than any time I can remember.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Let me ask you about that military statement that you just made for a minute because the new intelligence that is out there says that they are shifting specifically to the eastern part of Ukraine militarily.  And President Zelenskyy actually said that the Russians are pulling back from Kyiv.  We’ve actually seen that now.  You’ve said it’s what they do, not what they say.  We saw that.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  What does that tell you?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  So we are seeing that.  It’s, I think, too early to say what that actually means because they could be regrouping and restocking and replenishing and then coming back to Kyiv.  It’s also very possible that what we’re seeing is what it seems to be, which is a focus to the East and the South.  But Dana, even there, if that’s what they’re doing, then I think that the Ukrainians have already demonstrated that unless they’re able to move every single Ukrainian out of whatever piece of territory they’re trying to hold, it’s not going to last because the will of the Ukrainian people is clear:  They will not be subjected to a Russian occupation whether that’s in and around Kyiv or whether that’s in the East and the South.</p>
<p>But here is the problem:  In the meantime, the terrible death and destruction that you started with is going to continue.  And that’s why it is so urgent that Russia end this war of aggression and we do everything that we can to support the Ukrainians, to put pressure on Russia, to strengthen our own defenses.  All of that is going to strengthen Ukraine’s hand at the negotiating table and hopefully bring this to a quicker end.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  There are reports that Soviet-era tanks will be transferred to Ukraine.  Can you tell me about the U.S. role in facilitating that?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Dana, I can’t get into specific weapon systems.  What I can say is this:  First, we have provided, just over the course of this administration, $2.3 billion in security assistance of one kind or another to Ukraine, just $1.6 billion in the last month alone.  That includes many different weapon systems.  And let me give you one example of this:  Between the United States and our allies and partners, for every Russian tank, there are or will soon be in Ukraine more than 10 anti-tank systems for every Russian tank.</p>
<p>So across the board, what we’re trying to do is to make sure that Ukrainians have the systems that they need, that they can use, and they can use right away.  And that’s what’s been happening.  It’s been incredibly effective because of the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian forces.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  So what you just described sounds like the U.S. facilitating those tanks going in.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We are working with countries around the world to facilitate the movement of the systems that the Ukrainians can actually use into Ukraine one way or another.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  This week Ukraine floated the idea of taking a Switzerland-like position of neutrality in Europe as part of a peace deal with Russia, but only if Western nations provide security guarantees if Ukraine is attacked.  Would the U.S. help provide those security guarantees?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  So Dana, first, all of this is up to the Ukrainians, which is to say that if they negotiate something that meets their needs, that preserves their sovereignty, their independence, we will back it.  And we’re not going to be less Ukrainian than Ukrainians.  We’re not going to be more Ukrainian than Ukrainians.  So first and foremost, it’s up to them, to their elected representatives, to President Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>When it comes to the future, we and allies and partners are going to want to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that this can’t happen again and that Ukraine has the means to defend itself, to deter further Russian aggression.  So we will look at anything that we can do to back up that kind of outcome.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Sounds like that’s a yes because this is coming from the Ukrainians, as you know.  But they &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  No, I’m not going to get – yeah, I’m not going to get ahead of any details of what might come into some kind of agreement.  But we’re going to want to make sure that we do what we can to help Ukraine defend itself going forward, to deter future Russian aggression.  There are many things that could go into that, but I’m not going to get ahead of them.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Before I let you go, the Biden administration announced this week that you will lift a Trump-era pandemic restriction called Title 42, which restricted immigration at the Southern border.  It comes as your administration says there could be up to 18,000 apprehensions of undocumented migrants per day.  Does the administration see an influx of migrants as a problem, and can you guarantee that they will be treated humanely?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, Dana, first, when it comes to Title 42, all along we’ve been following the science.  That’s what this is about.  So when the CDC and others conclude that the science doesn’t warrant that, as is now happening, then we’ll take action.</p>
<p>Here’s my focus and the Vice President’s focus as well:  We’re focused on making sure that people throughout our hemisphere have opportunities at home going forward so they’re not faced with this really hard choice of leaving everything behind and trying to come to the United States.  So building that kind of opportunity, creating what one of my colleagues has called a “right to remain,” is our focus.</p>
<p>In the nearer term, the focus I have is trying to make sure that transit countries in particular take steps to make sure that it – that folks who might come or try to come to the United States through their countries can’t do that.  So that’s what I’m focused on.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, thank you so much for your time.  I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks.  Great to be with you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States welcomes steps by the Government of Ethiopia and regional authorities to implement a cessation of hostilities. We commend them on the delivery of humanitarian assistance over recent days to Ethiopians in the Tigray and Afar regions. Over one hundred thousand Ethiopians will receive life-saving food from the two initial convoys that have mobilized in the past three days. This is an important step toward implementing the cessation of hostilities and addressing the urgent humanitarian needs in both regions. Now, we urge all stakeholders to make every effort possible to sustain the delivery of life-saving assistance.</p>
<p>The United States appreciates the extraordinary efforts of humanitarian actors to enable this delivery of humanitarian assistance. Operating in difficult circumstances across Ethiopia, humanitarian actors continue to show their agility, dedication, and commitment to serving those in need. We call on all parties in conflict-affected regions to ensure the safety of humanitarian staff. The United States supports and acknowledges the positive undertakings in this regard made by the Government of Ethiopia and the regional authorities in Tigray and Afar.</p>
<p>We urge all parties to build upon this positive humanitarian development to take the difficult next steps to realize peace in northern Ethiopia. The United States will continue to do everything within our power to assist all Ethiopians in need throughout the country and support an inclusive political process to achieve progress toward common security and prosperity for all Ethiopians.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><b>MR ICE:</b>  Thank you so much, Cynthia.  And I’ll let everybody know that while we called this a State Department briefing, it’s actually an interagency briefing today with our colleagues from USAID and the Department of Defense, whom we’re very glad to do this with today.</p>
<p>So good morning once again, everyone, and thank you for joining us.  Today we will be discussing what we can describe as the latest progress in implementing the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability.  As a quick reminder here at the top, this morning’s briefing is on the record but its contents are embargoed until the end of the call.</p>
<p>Okay.  It is my pleasure to let everyone on the line know that we are joined today by Assistant Secretary of State for Conflict and Stabilization Operations Anne Witkowsky; we’re also joined by Assistant to the USAID Administrator for Conflict Prevention and Stabilization Robert Jenkins; and Principal Director of Counternarcotics and Stabilization Policy at the Department of Defense Joseph McMenamin; and also from here at State, Managing Director for Policy Roman Napoli from the Office of Foreign Assistance.</p>
<p>We’re going to start off with some opening remarks from several of our briefers today, and then we’ll open it up to just a few of your questions.  Okay.  And with that, I’d like to go ahead and turn it over to Assistant Secretary Witkowsky.  Ma’am.</p>
<p><b>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WITKOWSKY:  </b>Thank you, J.T., and hello to those who have joined.  I’m Anne Witkowsky, Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations.</p>
<p>The President, with support of the U.S. Congress, has initiated a new stage in our implementation of the Global Fragility Act of 2019 and the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability.  We are moving forward in a spirit of partnership to implement the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability – Haiti, Libya, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and the coastal West Africa region, which is Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Togo.</p>
<p>Under the strategy, we’ll begin developing comprehensive 10-year plans for each location.  These plans will emphasize locally driven solutions, long-term visions for our combined efforts, and evidence-based learning.  We recognize that close cooperation between the United States and likeminded regional, national, and local actors, including civil society, will be key to the success of the strategy.  We will tailor our shared approaches to the unique circumstances of local and regional contexts.</p>
<p>A decade-long outlook supports greater consistency across U.S. administrations and commitment to working with partners over the long term.  We will create feedback loops through monitoring and evaluations that will inform learning as we implement the plans with our partners.  In this way, the strategy presents the U.S. Government with a unique opportunity to balance a long-term view with near-term adaptation.</p>
<p>With a focus on locally driven efforts and solutions tailored to local contexts, planning under the strategy will seek to address emerging threats and address the underlying causes of violence and instability.  Our objective is to build resilience to prevent conflicts and crises from breaking out or deteriorating further.</p>
<p>This strategy requires a whole-of-government effort to integrated diplomacy, development, security-sector engagement.  We reflect this whole-of-government approach in our representation here on the call with USAID’s Rob Jenkins; Joe McMenamin, my colleague from the Defense Department; as well as Roman Napoli from the State Department’s Office of Foreign Assistance.</p>
<p>In sum, with the announcement of these priority countries, we are taking the next step to chart a new way forward in how the United States partners with other nations to address the challenges of conflict and instability.  The announcement today is also the next critical step in translating the ambitious goals of the bipartisan Global Fragility Act into reality.  Implementing the strategy will prove challenging, but it also affords us an opportunity to bring new ideas, resources, and collective action to some very pressing and important problems.  Our prosperity and security depend on peaceful, self-reliant, and stable economic and security partners.</p>
<p>With that, I will turn it over to Rob.</p>
<p><b>MR JENKINS:</b>  Well, thank you, Anne, and good morning, everyone.  An important part of the strategy and its implementation will be partnerships.  As the President has said, our diplomats, officers, and experts will work in close cooperation with multilateral organizations and a wide variety of local partners in each nation where these efforts will be pursued, including civil society organizations, community leaders, businesses, and government officials.  Those who are closest and most vulnerable to these challenges know best where the opportunities for peace and stability lie.  They represent the strongest source of promise and immunity from destabilizing forces, and we must support their strength and their resilience.</p>
<p>We know not only is going it alone not smart, it doesn’t work.  My administrator, Samantha Power of USAID, has challenged all of us to maximize the extent to which we can work directly with local partners, working in true, respectful, and effective partnership with the governments, communities and people we are trying to help.  We have learned many lessons in the last two decades, and some of them are very hard lessons.  One of them is we’re not only wasting time if we think we can impose our plan on a situation and expect to achieve success by force of will, number of boots on the ground, or amounts of dollars spent.  We’re wasting time, energy, money, and goodwill to do it alone.</p>
<p>Our lodestar must be inclusive development, working with governments and the people we’re there to help and working with on true partnerships, respectful partnerships as equals.  And inclusive development is co-creation, joint implementation, and acknowledging that we’re in support, helping our friends and partners where they are and where they live.</p>
<p>Thank you.  And with that, I’ll hand it over to Joe at the Department of Defense.</p>
<p><b>MR MCMENAMIN:</b>  Thank you, Rob.  My name, just a refresher, Joe McMenamin, and I serve as the principal director for counternarcotics and stabilization policy under the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.  I’d like to thank you all for the opportunity to talk about Department of Defense efforts and (inaudible) in support of the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability.</p>
<p>Our counternarcotics and stabilization policy office is the lead for the department’s implementation of the Global Fragility Act and is responsible for a vast set of policy issues including counternarcotics, stabilization, UN peacekeeping, and civil affairs.  Several of these areas touch Global Fragility Act issues.  The department is proud to support and has been working closely with the Department of State, USAID, and other agencies well before the Global Fragility Act was passed in December 2019.</p>
<p>We have been joined at the hip for many years, to include laying the groundwork for eventually what became the Stabilization Assistance Review, written together in a collaborative fashion.  Specific to the Global Fragility Act, we worked closely on the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, the prologue, and the country selection.  Such efforts will continue as the Global Fragility Act implementation begins.</p>
<p>The Global Fragility Act reflects the administration’s view of emerging threats and opportunities and outlines guiding principles to inform our whole-of-government work in partnership with other countries, institutions, and organizations.  We too have learned a lot from our past stabilization experiences around the world.  One example of the lessons has been the importance of the interagency working closely together in unstable spaces to consolidate gains for long-lasting effects.  When the interagency isn’t coordinated or present, stabilization efforts are not lasting.  We, DOD, are in support of State and USAID, but it’s really a government approach to prevent conflict and promote stability.  I believe this is where the Global Fragility Act will be invaluable in achieving long-term success.</p>
<p>In the department, we’re still concerned about violent extremist organizations, as they often pose as supporters and providers of stability to the citizenry while obviously actually undermining stability of the state as a whole.  Long-term partner engagement will build resilience against violent extremist recruitment and the spread of terrorism.  DOD has a strong and lasting bilateral relationship with a lot of the Global Fragility Act selected countries led by our office, the joint staff regional offices, as well as the combatant commands.  Our combatant commands will play a key role in the implementation of this activity.</p>
<p>USAID’s Bureau of Conflict Prevention and Stabilization often assigns and has assigned liaison officers in our office, Counternarcotics and Stabilization Policy, to the combatant commands to facilitate interagency coordination.  Likewise, DOD assigns military officers at State and USAID.  Diplomacy, development, and defense cooperation are at an all-time high.</p>
<p>Finally, preventing, promoting stability, and trying to get ahead of challenges before they arise is important and difficult work.  The Global Fragility Act success depends on close cooperation and coordination between U.S. Government agencies.  And I think this is a great step forward in that endeavor.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MR ICE:</b>  Thank you so much, Joe.  At this point, Cynthia, would you go ahead and give the instructions again for getting into the question queue?</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b>  Certainly, and once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press 1 and then 0.  You will hear a tone acknowledging that you are in queue.  We will take the questions in the order that they queue up.  You may remove yourself from queue by pressing the same 1-0 command.  So once again, 1 and then 0 for any questions or comments, and one moment, please.</p>
<p><b>MR ICE:</b>  Thank you so much, Cynthia.  Okay.  Let’s go for our first question to Daphne Psaledakis.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hi, thank you for doing this.  The text released today mentioned the conflict in Ukraine.  How do you expect that will influence your strategy with the partner countries named today?  And along those lines, will USAID help Taiwan deliver its humanitarian assistance to Ukraine?  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WITKOWSKY:</b>  Thank you for that question.  First of all, on the selection of countries, I want to underscore that the set of countries and sub-regions illustrates our commitment to partnering with a variety of countries to respond to a variety of challenges that are weakening state capacity and legitimacy.  We want to acknowledge the complexity of these challenges in different contexts and want to work together with our partner countries, their governments, their civil society, and their private sectors to bolster their abilities and resources to resist these threats.</p>
<p>As we watch the conflict deepen and expand, the shocks of the war in Ukraine are being felt beyond Ukraine’s borders.  We are seeing it as millions have fled Ukraine to seek safe refuge and the real threat to food security for millions and millions of people worldwide in places that are already quite vulnerable to hunger.  So the effects are the – of the conflict are complex, and it will touch all aspects of affected countries, but the point here is that the strategy elevates conflict prevention as a priority and will unite our actions – our U.S. actions – in the diplomatic, development, and security sector spheres.  The events we’re seeing today reiterate the importance of an integrated U.S. whole-of-government approach tailored to these most pressing challenges in our partner countries.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MR JENKINS:</b>  Thank you for the question about Ukraine.  As you probably know, USAID and our State Department colleagues are doing an amazing amount of work both inside Ukraine and outside to help IDPs, refugees; continue our support to the Ukrainian Government and communities inside Ukraine.  Unfortunately, I’m not aware of any planning regarding Taiwan and assistance to Ukraine, so I’d have to get back to you through my press office on that.  I – my not being aware does not necessarily mean there isn’t some planning going on.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MR ICE:</b>  Okay, let’s go to the line of Kemi Osukoya.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hello?</p>
<p><b>MR ICE:</b>  Yes, go ahead.  We can hear you.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Oh, okay, thank you.  I was wondering if you could talk more about your plan – your strategic plan in Africa, in particular in West Africa, in Sudan, and also Somalia.</p>
<p>Hello?  Hello, can you hear me?</p>
<p><b>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WITKOWSKY:</b>  Yes.  Yes, thank you very much.  Yes, thank you very much for the question.  The – yes, thank you.</p>
<p>The decisions that were taken, the selection of partner countries that we’re going forward with today within Africa, are within coastal West Africa and in Mozambique.  So we’re going to be focusing under the U.S. strategy on those countries, building on our lessons learned, and moving forward with our whole-of-government, 10-year, locally led plans.  It is, however, the case that our effort under this strategy will help us learn lessons not only as they apply to the countries that we have announced today in moving forward under the Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, but also, we hope, in the future will be applicable to places such as the countries that you’ve identified.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MR ICE:</b>  And – great.  Once again, if you’d like to get into our question queue with our briefers, dial 1 then 0.  We’ll stand by just a moment.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b>  And once again, that is 1 and then 0 for your questions or comments.</p>
<p><b>MR ICE:</b>  Okay, folks.  Well, once again, thank you so much for dialing in today.  We appreciate your participation in our briefing this afternoon.  I do want to take this opportunity to once again thank our briefers from here at the Department of State’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, Assistant Secretary Witkowsky; our colleague from USAID, the Bureau for Conflict Prevention and Stabilization, Assistant to the Administrator Rob Jenkins; and from over at DOD, Principal Director of Counternarcotics and Stabilization Policy Joe McMenamin; and again, from here at the State Department’s Office of Foreign Assistance, Managing Director for Policy Roman Napoli.</p>
<p>Again, appreciate everyone calling in.  At this point the briefing is ended and the embargo is lifted.  Have a nice rest of your day and a nice weekend.  Thank you.</p>

<p><b>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WITKOWSKY:</b>  Thank you for that question.  First of all, on the selection of countries, I want to underscore that the set of countries and sub-regions illustrates our commitment to partnering with a variety of countries to respond to a variety of challenges that are weakening state capacity and legitimacy.  We want to acknowledge the complexity of these challenges in different contexts and want to work together with our partner countries, their governments, their civil society, and their private sectors to bolster their abilities and resources to resist these threats.</p>
<p>As we watch the conflict deepen and expand, the shocks of the war in Ukraine are being felt beyond Ukraine’s borders.  We are seeing it as millions have fled Ukraine to seek safe refuge and the real threat to food security for millions and millions of people worldwide in places that are already quite vulnerable to hunger.  So the effects are the – of the conflict are complex, and it will touch all aspects of affected countries, but the point here is that the strategy elevates conflict prevention as a priority and will unite our actions – our U.S. actions – in the diplomatic, development, and security sector spheres.  The events we’re seeing today reiterate the importance of an integrated U.S. whole-of-government approach tailored to these most pressing challenges in our partner countries.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MR JENKINS:</b>  Thank you for the question about Ukraine.  As you probably know, USAID and our State Department colleagues are doing an amazing amount of work both inside Ukraine and outside to help IDPs, refugees; continue our support to the Ukrainian Government and communities inside Ukraine.  Unfortunately, I’m not aware of any planning regarding Taiwan and assistance to Ukraine, so I’d have to get back to you through my press office on that.  I – my not being aware does not necessarily mean there isn’t some planning going on.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MR ICE:</b>  Okay, let’s go to the line of Kemi Osukoya.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Hello?</p>
<p><b>MR ICE:</b>  Yes, go ahead.  We can hear you.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Oh, okay, thank you.  I was wondering if you could talk more about your plan – your strategic plan in Africa, in particular in West Africa, in Sudan, and also Somalia.</p>
<p>Hello?  Hello, can you hear me?</p>
<p><b>ASSISTANT SECRETARY WITKOWSKY:</b>  Yes.  Yes, thank you very much.  Yes, thank you very much for the question.  The – yes, thank you.</p>
<p>The decisions that were taken, the selection of partner countries that we’re going forward with today within Africa, are within coastal West Africa and in Mozambique.  So we’re going to be focusing under the U.S. strategy on those countries, building on our lessons learned, and moving forward with our whole-of-government, 10-year, locally led plans.  It is, however, the case that our effort under this strategy will help us learn lessons not only as they apply to the countries that we have announced today in moving forward under the Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, but also, we hope, in the future will be applicable to places such as the countries that you’ve identified.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MR ICE:</b>  And – great.  Once again, if you’d like to get into our question queue with our briefers, dial 1 then 0.  We’ll stand by just a moment.</p>
<p><b>OPERATOR:</b>  And once again, that is 1 and then 0 for your questions or comments.</p>
<p><b>MR ICE:</b>  Okay, folks.  Well, once again, thank you so much for dialing in today.  We appreciate your participation in our briefing this afternoon.  I do want to take this opportunity to once again thank our briefers from here at the Department of State’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, Assistant Secretary Witkowsky; our colleague from USAID, the Bureau for Conflict Prevention and Stabilization, Assistant to the Administrator Rob Jenkins; and from over at DOD, Principal Director of Counternarcotics and Stabilization Policy Joe McMenamin; and again, from here at the State Department’s Office of Foreign Assistance, Managing Director for Policy Roman Napoli.</p>
<p>Again, appreciate everyone calling in.  At this point the briefing is ended and the embargo is lifted.  Have a nice rest of your day and a nice weekend.  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><strong>ECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good morning, everyone.  It’s a great pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Holness to Washington, to the State Department.  Great to have you here.  We now 60 years of independence to celebrate, 60 years of our own diplomatic relationship, but especially the work that we’re doing together, today, that really is making a difference and making a difference in the lives of people in both our countries.</p>
<p>I really want to applaud, Mr. Prime Minister, your very strong economic leadership in Jamaica, and our partnership in the Caribbean, which I think is never been better, and that’s in large part due to your engagement and your leadership.  So, we’re very pleased to have you here to talk about many of the issues that bring us together in our own region, but also issues that are affecting people globally – from climate to COVID, to other things.  And we’re of course, very much forward to working together on the Summit of the Americas, which is coming up.</p>
<p>So thank you very much for being here.  I’m looking forward to a good conversation.  Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong>  Thank you, Mr. President, for your warm – Mr. – I keep making this (inaudible).  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>I won’t tell my boss.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for the warm welcome for me and my delegation.  We have had several meetings, which have gone very well, including a meeting with the Vice President.</p>
<p>Jamaica and the United States have had a very long and strong relationship, particularly on the people-to-people side of things.  From government-to-government perspective, Jamaica and the United States have shared values and needs.  We’re both strong democracies.  And in an era where democracy is not necessarily (inaudible) state of nations, it is very important that democracies work together to strengthen their partnerships and to explore ways in which we can help each other.</p>
<p>I am pleased to report that Jamaica has made significant progress in its microeconomic development, particularly with its fiscal stability and sustainability and debt reduction.  We were able to do this with significant help and facilitation by the United States, and we are here to express our gratitude for that help.</p>
<p>We are now at a point where we can pivot to other areas of our economic and social development, our human capital development.  Jamaica has been a net exporter of talent to the United States, and I think our longstanding people-to-people relationship, with migration back and forth, would have been mutually beneficial.  But Jamaica is in a state now where its growth potential, its growth horizon, could potentially be limited by its human resource development.  And this is an area in which we want to explore ways in which we can further partnership.</p>
<p>The present global and geopolitical instabilities have highlighted the vulnerabilities of small island developing states.  We take great note of yesterday’s announcement by President Biden regarding the release of strategic reserves.  We hope that that will have a positive effect on the reduction of oil prices, and hopefully it will be beneficial to small island countries and developing states, like Jamaica, who are facing a really very difficult time just coming out of the pandemic and then being hit with these other geopolitical issues over which we have no control or (inaudible).  We have to also discuss matters of climate change.  We met in COP, and we had very good discussions as to how small island, developing countries could be assisted and facilitated.</p>
<p>And then there is always the issue of our national security and your security interests in the region.  We are in a region which is considered near third world, and the ability of states within the region to control their domain, control their maritime borders and their land borders, is critical.  Obviously, crime and violence, (inaudible) – these are areas in which we can have great discussions and great partnerships.</p>
<p>And then there is the issue of how do we convert our democracies into prosperous economies.  That is the real challenge.  How do we get our democracies to be prosperous for our people? And And I think for smaller and developing states like Jamaica, a small shift in policy – economic policy, could result in gains that are significant both for our economies, but for your economies as well.  Jamaica considers itself to be a friendly near-shore destination for investments and production capacity.  And I think that it would be in the U.S.’s interest to look at countries like Jamaica, to position strategic production capacity which could be beneficial for the stability of production chains and supply of goods and services.</p>
<p>So Mr. President – Mr. Vice President – (laughter).  Mr. Secretary.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPANT:</strong>  You’re almost there.  (Laughter.)  One more step.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER HOLNESS:</strong>  We look forward to the Summit of the Americas, and Jamaica will be attending in full force.  And I must say that we were very happy to be invited and participate in the Summit for Democracy.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you very much.</p>
