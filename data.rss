					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>On March 30, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will travel to Algeria for meetings with President Abdelmadjid Tebboune and Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra to discuss regional security and stability, economic cooperation, and advancing human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The Secretary will promote America’s role as the Country of Honor at the Algiers International Trade Fair in June, the largest trade show of its kind in Africa.  He will meet with U.S. business representatives in Algeria to discuss deepening economic ties and promoting U.S.-Algeria trade and investment.</p>
<p><b>A DEEP AND LASTING RELATIONSHIP</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The United States and Algeria share a long history – from the 1795 Treaty of Peace and Amity to hosting negotiations to release American hostages from Tehran in 1981 – and our bilateral relationship continues to flourish.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Our security and counterterrorism cooperation remains a cornerstone of our bilateral relationship. We are also encouraged by the deepening economic and cultural ties between the United States and Algeria.  More and more U.S. companies are seeking investment in Algeria, and those already here are creating jobs across a wide range of sectors.  The fact that we are the country of honor at this year’s Algiers International Fair – the largest trade fair of its kind in Africa – demonstrates Algeria’s interest in American products and technology.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>BILATERAL AND REGIONAL POLITICAL ISSUES</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Earlier this month, Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman and Foreign Minister Lamamra met in Algiers to express strong support for the efforts of Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary General Staffan de Mistura’s leadership in resuming the UN-led political process to advance a durable and dignified resolution to the conflict in Western Sahara that will create a peaceful and prosperous future for the people of Western Sahara and the region.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We also agreed on the importance of regional stability for the entire Sahel and the need to counter the destabilizing presence of terrorist groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Our relationship is multifaceted.  We work closely with Algeria on counterterrorism and regional security, so that we can learn from one another and strengthen our respective security capabilities. Algeria hosted a Joint Military Dialogue March 14-15, during which we further discussed our commitment to regional security.</li>
<li>The United States and Algeria regularly discuss the importance of protecting and advancing human rights, including freedoms of expression and belief and the important role of independent media and civil society. Human rights are a central pillar of U.S. foreign policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>CULTURAL TIES AND EXCHANGES</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The United States shares strong cultural and economic relations with Algeria, which continue to improve at both the government-to-government and people-to-people levels. The OneBeat program in February and March featured 23 musicians from the United States, Algeria, and all of Algeria’s neighbors who created original music together in a three-week musical residency capped by two well-attended public concerts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no better indicator of the growing partnership between our two countries than our growing cultural ties. Algeria’s continued interest in English-language training and entrepreneurship are key areas where we are already working together.  We are pleased to have launched earlier this month two new programs that will strengthen U.S.-Algerian cooperation.  The State Department initiated the Link Project in Algeria to help 120 Algerian government officials improve their professional English language skills.  This will enable them to participate in international conferences and exchanges, communicate with international counterparts, and engage with English-language reports and other content.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The State Department is also working with the University of Notre Dame in Indiana to implement a three-year project to create a “research hub” to link Algerian research institutions in five key fields – artificial intelligence, applied mathematics, climate change and renewable energies, health and pharmaceutical sciences, and agriculture – with their American counterparts to facilitate the exchange of ideas and people. This project will build the research capacity of Algerian universities and create key linkages between Algerian researchers and the private sector.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>WESTERN SAHARA</b></p>
<ul>
<li>We strongly support the efforts of Staffan de Mistura, the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We are fully engaged diplomatically, in support of the UN and together with our international partners, to reinforce a credible political process leading to an enduring and dignified resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>SAHEL</b></p>
<ul>
<li>We are both very concerned about the destabilizing presence of terrorist groups in the Sahel, and we both want security and prosperity in the region.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Algeria has played a key role in facilitating this stability through its mediation of the 2015 Algiers Peace Accord and continues to be a regional leader promoting resolution to ongoing conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>COVID-19 RESPONSE</b></p>
<ul>
<li>We have consulted regularly with the Ministry of Health about COVID-19 risks, and we supplied Algeria with over 600,000 doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine last year through COVAX.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>CLIMATE CHANGE</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Both Algeria and the United States understand the critical importance of working together to tackle climate change.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Rabat, Morocco</p>
<p>Dar Kika Salam</p>
<div>(Via Translation)</div>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Ladies and gentlemen, we are taking advantage of his whirlwind tour of the Middle East and North Africa to receive him for an exclusive interview with Medi 1.  We discussed various topics with the US Secretary of State, such as the goals and challenges of his visit to Morocco, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Iranian nuclear agreement, and of course the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Hello, Antony Blinken.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Hello.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Thank you for meeting with us here in Rabat, six years after the interview you agreed to grant to Medi 1 TV in June 2016.  You have just returned from an unprecedented summit held in the Negev desert in Israel, a little over a year after the Abraham Accords.  How did relations evolve after this summit, Mr.  Blinken?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>First of all, this is a pretty remarkable picture.  A picture that we could not have seen four, five years ago.  Not even two years ago.  We could not have seen the leaders of Morocco, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, the United States, and Israel together in one picture.  And I think this reflects the desire to find the possibility to create together opportunities for the people of each country, because by creating trade links, links between students, between citizens, we will be able to focus together on issues that have an impact on everyday life, such as the investment, the infrastructure.</p>
<p>We are working together on the climate, on global health, and on security issues as well.  This is very powerful.  Of course, we are not setting aside the future of the Palestinian people and the need to also create a country for the Palestinians and try to invest in their future as well in the meantime.  So I think this is very powerful, but it also demonstrates, just like His Majesty the King said, a vision and the courage to no longer accept the barriers of the past, and in fact to overcome them and find a way to bring us together.  This is very powerful.</p>
<p>Lastly, what we are going to do together.  We talked about this in Negev yesterday, we will focus on concrete projects and on how to act together to meet the needs and desires of the people in each of our countries.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Mr. Secretary of State, can we say that today and after this summit in Negev, the relations between the United States and the Gulf countries are at their highest?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>We have partnerships that have existed for many years, and those partnerships are essential and important to us, not only in terms of security issues, but the future of our countries as well.  I think it was an important time as well to not only strengthen those partnerships, but to strengthen the idea that the United States is invested in those partnerships.  This is the message that I wanted to convey to my colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Very good.  Morocco is the third and penultimate leg of your tour, Mr.  Secretary of State.  It is undeniable that Morocco represents a strategic ally for the United States in the region today, both on security issues, as you so aptly mentioned, and on issues relating to the preservation of peace as well.  In your opinion, what is the role that Morocco is called upon to play in the future, both regionally and in Africa?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Morocco is first and foremost an essential partnership for us, and it has existed for a long time.  It is of the utmost importance to us because we obviously act on various issues bilaterally.  We act together at the regional level where Morocco’s voice and diplomacy have a very significant impact, whether in challenges such as in the Sahel, Libya, but also in Africa, West Africa for example, and what we can achieve together.</p>
<p>It also has an impact at the global level because we are working through this partnership on issues like the COVID pandemic.  Morocco has been very successful in the vaccination campaign for example, and we look at what we can learn, what we can achieve together across the world and in Africa.  Same goes for the climate, where Morocco has very advanced projects to manage what is really an existential dossier for everyone.  So what I see is a partnership that not only acts in the region, but more and more at the global level.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>You mentioned the Sahel.  The stability in the Sahara sub-region depends on the issue of the Moroccan Sahara.  I would like to quote a brief excerpt from the State Department statement on the purpose of your visit to Morocco.  I quote: “We reaffirm the importance of respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and national unity of all member states of the United Nations.”  Knowing that the sovereignty of Morocco has been recognized by the United States, what are the potential future states in this matter today or rather tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>We have discussed this issue today, just as we discuss it every time we meet.  We find Morocco’s autonomy plan to be a credible, serious, and realistic plan, and I believe that it can respond to the needs and aspirations of the people of Western Sahara.  The special envoy of the United Nations Secretary General Staffan de Mistura is conducting very important work, and we support him.  We discussed this issue today with my colleague and friend Nasser Bourita.  This is something that we will be following up on in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>So in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>We are working on it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Very good.  A new ambassador has just been appointed.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>His Excellency Puneet Talwar.  What would be the roadmap in his new assignments in Morocco, Mr.  Blinken?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Puneet Talwar is the ambassador who was just nominated and he must be approved by the Senate, but I hope that will happen quickly.  He is a friend, a long-time friend, and we have worked together for 20 years.  He is very close to President Biden and worked on his staff when they were in the Senate.  So they worked together, and I know he will be an exceptional ambassador for the United States and that he will be exceptional for the ties between our two countries.  I trust him completely and President Biden trusts him completely.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And based on your experience with Morocco, is there any advice you can give him?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>How fortunate.  How fortunate to come here to this remarkable country.  How fortunate to be here at a time when our work together is so important.  How fortunate to be here at a time when I see all kinds of possibilities to strengthen what we do together and even to broaden our horizons, in the Negev yesterday and across the world tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>The next and final stop in your tour is our eastern neighbor, Algeria.  Given the current situation in Europe and the resulting energy issues, will Algerian gas, and particularly the gas pipeline, be part of the negotiations and discussions that you will have with the Algerian authorities?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Two things.  First, you mention the current situation in Europe, and that is very important because, initially, Russia’s aggression towards Ukraine is creating enormous suffering in Ukraine.  Half of the children in Ukraine are now displaced and had to flee their homes.  Therefore, what is happening is important at that level, but it is also important for two other reasons.</p>
<p>First, there are very important principles at stake, principles that support security and peace throughout the world, not only in Europe, but here as well.  When these principles are attacked as they are by Russia, it poses a problem for everyone.  The principle that a country cannot change the borders of another country by violence, that a country cannot decide for another regarding its policies and future – that is an issue.  But thirdly, we see an impact across the world.  We now have problems in food flows because of this Russian aggression in Ukraine, for the exports of agricultural products are now at stake.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Especially wheat on which many African countries depend, including Morocco.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Exactly, especially wheat.  Farmers in Ukraine are forced to either fight for their country or flee.  The harvest is not completed, and exports are blocked in the ports of south Ukraine.  This creates a problem across the world.  Energy prices are another problem.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>They are exploding.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>They are exploding.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Do you think it is maybe time to seek other alternatives to Russian gas for example, and maybe through the reopening of this Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Europe is very focused on the idea that we now really need to diversify from Russian gas and oil, because Russia is now unfortunately using them as a policy tool.  That is mainly the problem, and it is obviously acting in a totally unacceptable way for everyone.  So I think when you talk to European countries, you know that they are very focused on the need to diversify.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And the Americans would perhaps plead for this diversification, which would maybe come from these countries.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>A diversification that comes from everywhere in a way, including us.  But not only diversification.  The shift should also be done with a view to this fight for the climate.  This is also very important.  We need to make sure that, amid this diversification, we try to advance the climate issue so that we can prevent the world from getting warmer.</p>

<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Europe is very focused on the idea that we now really need to diversify from Russian gas and oil, because Russia is now unfortunately using them as a policy tool.  That is mainly the problem, and it is obviously acting in a totally unacceptable way for everyone.  So I think when you talk to European countries, you know that they are very focused on the need to diversify.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And the Americans would perhaps plead for this diversification, which would maybe come from these countries.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>A diversification that comes from everywhere in a way, including us.  But not only diversification.  The shift should also be done with a view to this fight for the climate.  This is also very important.  We need to make sure that, amid this diversification, we try to advance the climate issue so that we can prevent the world from getting warmer.</p>

<p>We strongly condemn today’s terrorist attack in Bnei Brak, Israel, that killed five innocent victims.  This comes after two other recent horrific terrorist attacks in Hadera and Be’er Sheva, Israel.  This violence is unacceptable.  Israelis—like all people around the world—should be able to live in peace and without fear.  Our hearts go out to the families of those killed in the attacks.</p>
<p>May their memories be a blessing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Following is a joint statement on the UNITAMS-AU-IGAD Facilitated Political Process issued by Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the European Union as members of the Friends of Sudan.</p>
<p>Begin text:</p>
<p>Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the European Union as members of the Friends of Sudan reiterate our strong support for the combined efforts of the UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission to Sudan (UNITAMS), the African Union (AU), and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) to facilitate a Sudanese-led political process with the aim of restoring a civilian-led transition to democracy. We applaud these actors’ ongoing efforts to consult with a broad range of Sudanese stakeholders. We look forward to the imminent launch of the next phase of the talks with the aim of building consensus around the structure of credible, civilian-led institutions that will lead Sudan through a revived civilian-led transition period, culminating in free and fair democratic elections. The urgency cannot be overstated. We, therefore, urge constructive engagement of all stakeholders in this next phase and underscore the importance of ensuring women, as well as youth, and other historically marginalized groups enjoy full, effective, and meaningful participation and inclusion throughout every stage of the process.</p>
<p>We welcome the progress made so far through the cooperation of Sudanese stakeholders and the combined efforts of UNITAMS, the AU, and IGAD. For this UNITAMS-AU-IGAD-facilitated political process to succeed, an enabling environment that allows all stakeholders to participate and freely express their views must be created, and Sudanese citizens must be protected from all kinds of violence. We welcome the commitments of the Sudanese authorities in this regard and encourage their implementation. Full respect for freedoms of association, expression, and peaceful assembly is vital, as is protection of property.</p>
<p>We are deeply concerned by the immense economic pressures currently facing the Sudanese people and are committed to continuing to provide direct, humanitarian support to them during this difficult period. We look forward to the restoration of a credible transitional government agreed through the UNITAMS-AU-IGAD-facilitated political process, which would pave the way to restore economic assistance and international debt relief.</p>
<p>As members of the Friends of Sudan, we continue to endorse the Sudanese-led political process facilitated by UNITAMS, the AU, and IGAD as the best vehicle to realize the Sudanese people’s aspirations for freedom, peace, and justice and to restore Sudan’s democratic transition. We continue to pledge our full support to the Sudanese people and this process.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Wendy R. Sherman, Deputy Secretary of State</p>
<p>Thank you very much and thank you for giving me this opportunity today. Much appreciated, Madam President. I feel that I must make four critical points.</p>
<p>First, I want to be clear that the conflict that is being suffered by the Ukrainian people is not about the Russian Federation versus the West. One hundred and forty countries, just last week, spoke in support of ending this conflict and the need to end this humanitarian crisis. A hundred and forty-one countries supported the initial resolution in the UN General Assembly, to say that this invasion by Russia should stop.</p>
<p>So, with all due respect, Mr. Ambassador, this is not about Russia versus the West. This is about the support of the UN Charter and the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the right of all countries – all countries – to choose their political orientation and their foreign policy.</p>
<p>Second, I myself was engaged directly with Russian counterparts to find a peaceful way forward to meet the concerns of the Russian Federation. I sat opposite Russian counterparts and put on the table many options to address the concerns. We provided, as does NATO, a paper of very specific ways in which we could address, reciprocally and mutually, security concerns. President Putin chose an invasion, not diplomacy.</p>
<p>Third, with all due respect, Mr. Ambassador, as a Jewish American, I cannot help but say this is not about Nazis in Ukraine. Last week, former U.S. Secretary of State, and former Permanent Representative to this Council, and one of my most cherished personal friends, Madeleine Albright died. She loved representing the United States here. She would have been outraged by the words of the Russian Federation today.</p>
<p>Later in her life, she learned that her parents raised her as Catholic to protect her from the Nazis because her family was Jewish. She learned that three of her grandparents died at the hands of the Nazis, while in concentration camps. She knew that the Jewish President of Ukraine was certainly not a Nazi. And that the citizens of Ukraine being slaughtered and starving, and without food and medicine, and the subject of this humanitarian dialogue today, are not and never were Nazis.</p>
<p>And finally, this dialogue today is about the humanitarian needs of Ukrainian civilians and humanitarian needs of people around the world, who as David Beasley said so eloquently, “feeding hungry children, to feeding starving children.” It&#8217;s about, as he said, “going from a breadbasket to a breadline.”</p>
<p>We must all do whatever we can, of course, to stop war. But there is an easy choice here. And it is a choice that can be made today in Istanbul, by President Putin, and that is to stop the war. So let us all, over 140 countries around the world, continue to stand with Ukraine.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States notes with concern the growing tensions in South Sudan, including recent clashes between the South Sudan People’s Defense Force’s (SSPDF) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army/Movement-In Opposition (SPLA/M-IO) in Upper Nile state.  We call for both sides to observe fully their obligations under the existing peace agreement and note that inflammatory rhetoric is counterproductive and should cease immediately. The SPLM-IO’s withdrawal from all peace agreement monitoring and verification mechanisms undermines the peace agreement and must be immediately reversed as ceasefire monitoring bodies investigate the recent violence and seek to hold perpetrators responsible.</p>
<p>The United States calls on President Salva Kiir and First Vice President Riek Machar to do their utmost to de-escalate tensions and to uphold their respective obligations under the 2018 peace agreement, including its ceasefire provisions.  We call on both leaders to resume implementation of key, long-delayed provisions of the revitalized peace agreement, including taking the necessary steps to establish an inclusive process to draft a new constitution, to establish necessary electoral legislation and mechanisms, and to respect the freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly.  We urge regional states and institutions, namely the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, that are guarantors of the revitalized peace agreement to take swift action to lower tensions and put the peace process back on track prior to the expiration of the already extended transition period in February 2023.</p>
<p>All sides bear responsibility for the deteriorating situation.  Neither President Kiir nor First Vice President Machar have made good faith efforts to implement the provisions of the revitalized peace agreement, and both have resisted serious attempts to move South Sudan towards the peace, security, and prosperity the South Sudanese people continue to desire.  Furthermore, numerous other political leaders also fail to carry out their official responsibilities and many engage in political violence and otherwise violate the letter and spirit of the peace agreement. We call on all members of the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity to take the actions necessary to be seen as credible in the eyes of the South Sudanese people, starting with full adherence to and implementation of the 2018 peace agreement.</p>

<p>At the launch of the 2022 Joint Response Plan for the Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis in Bangladesh, U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh Peter Haas announced more than $152 million in additional humanitarian assistance for those in Bangladesh, Burma, and elsewhere in the region affected by the Burmese military’s genocide, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing against Rohingya.  With this new funding, our total assistance for this response reaches more than $1.7 billion since August 2017, when over 740,000 Rohingya were forced to flee to safety in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.  This announcement demonstrates our solidarity with Rohingya and the generous communities hosting them as well as our ongoing commitment to strengthening the international response to the Rohingya crisis and the escalating violence in Burma.</p>
<p>The humanitarian assistance includes nearly $51 million from the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) and more than $101 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  With more than $125 million for programs specifically in Bangladesh, this funding will enable our humanitarian partners to provide life-saving assistance to the over 920,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.  It also provides support to more than 540,000 affected members of the local host community in Bangladesh.  This assistance helps ensure children and young adults have access to education and vocational training, provides families with food, healthcare, access to clean water and sanitation to prevent the spread of disease, supports the protection of Rohingya refugees’ human rights and well-being, strengthens disaster preparedness, and helps combat the effects of climate change.  We commend our humanitarian partners for a strong and well-coordinated response as this crisis approaches its fifth year.</p>
<p>The United States recognizes that Bangladesh and its people have taken on an enormous responsibility in hosting refugees.  We are working with the Government of Bangladesh, Rohingya, and people within Burma toward finding solutions to this crisis, including the safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable return and reintegration of Rohingya refugees and internally displaced persons when conditions in Burma allow.  Secretary Blinken has determined that members of the Burmese military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Rohingya, and that many of those responsible for these atrocities are the same people who led the military coup in 2021 and ongoing violence across Burma.  We are relentlessly pressuring Burma’s military regime to stop its violence and return to the path of democracy.  At the same time, we also must expand education and livelihood opportunities, including cash-for-work programs and access to local markets, for Rohingya refugees in the region.  Education and income-generating activities are among the most effective methods to create safer refugee camps in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The United States remains committed to delivering aid to Rohingya, and we welcome the generous pledges made by other donors at today’s event.  However, more support is desperately needed.  We urge other donors to come forward now with additional funds to sustain and increase support for the Rakhine State/Rohingya refugee crisis and those suffering from the escalating violence perpetrated by the genocidal military in Burma today.</p>
