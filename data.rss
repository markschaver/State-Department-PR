					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Virtual Participation</p>
<p class="p1"><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, thank you very much, Foreign Minister Jaishankar.  It’s wonderful to be with you and please convey our thanks to Prime Minister Modi for bringing us together for this critically important discussion and for India’s leadership on these issues, especially in championing a free and open Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p class="p1">When I last had the chance to address the Council back in May, it was to underscore the importance of defending, upholding, and revitalizing the rules-based international order grounded in the United Nations Charter.  Few issues are more crucial to that endeavor than the future of our ocean.  The ocean not only covers 70 percent of Earth and accounts for 97 percent of its water, but it is crucial to the livelihood of our people and the sustainability of our planet.  Maritime safety and security are enduring interests of all nations and are vital natural (inaudible).</p>
<p class="p1">(Interruption.)</p>
<p class="p1">Thank you.  Freedom of navigation and overflight and the unimpeded flow of lawful maritime commerce are also critical to the security and prosperity of nations and to global stability.  The international community has long benefited from a rules-based maritime order where international law, as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, sets out the legal framework for all activities in the ocean and seas.</p>
<p class="p1">But despite having a clear body of international law that we’ve all committed to abide by and uphold, despite all the ways that freedom of the seas, open waterways, and the unimpeded flow of lawful maritime commerce have delivered for nations and people around the world, and despite the indispensable role this maritime order has played in fostering economic activity, security cooperation, scientific innovation, environmental sustainability – despite all of that, the order is under serious threat.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why I’m grateful for India’s leadership in bringing us together today and calling on all nations to recommit to defending and strengthening the maritime rules and principles that we forged together and committed to uphold.</p>
<p class="p1">Let me just speak, if I could, specifically to some of the critical areas where we see maritime rules and principles under threat.</p>
<p class="p1">In the South China Sea, we have seen dangerous encounters between vessels at sea and provocative actions to advance unlawful maritime claims.  The United States has made clear its concerns regarding actions that intimidate and bully other states from lawfully accessing their maritime resources.  And we and other countries, including South China Sea claimants, have protested such behavior and unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea.</p>
<p class="p1">Five years ago, an arbitral tribunal constituted under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention delivered a unanimous and legally binding decision to the parties before it firmly rejecting unlawful, expansive South China Sea maritime claims as being inconsistent with international law.  The United States has consistently called for all countries to conform their maritime claims to the International Law of the Sea as reflected in the 1982 convention.</p>
<p class="p1">This is in keeping with the peaceful resolution of disputes and the sovereign equality of member-states, which are core principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  Efforts to resolve maritime disputes through threat or use of force flout these principles.</p>
<p class="p1">Some may assert that resolving the dispute in the South China Sea is not the business of the United States or any other country that is not a claimant to the islands and waters.  But it is the business and, even more, the responsibility of every member-state to defend the rules that we’ve all agreed to follow and peacefully resolve maritime disputes.  Conflict in the South China Sea or in any ocean would have serious global consequences for security and for commerce.  What’s more, when a state faces no consequences for ignoring these rules, it fuels greater impunity and instability everywhere.</p>
<p class="p1">States are also provocatively and unlawfully advancing their interests in the Persian Gulf and the Black Sea.  On July 29th, the <i>Mercer Street</i>, a commercial ship that was peacefully transiting international waters in the North Arabian Sea, was attacked using explosive unmanned aerial vehicles, resulting in the death of two people.  Upon review of the available information, we are confident that Iran conducted this unjustified attack, which is part of a pattern of attacks and other provocative behavior.  These actions threaten freedom of navigation through this crucial waterway, international shipping and commerce, and the lives of people on the vessels involved.</p>
<p class="p1">On behalf of the United States, I reiterate my condolences to the families of the victims and to the United Kingdom and Romania.  It is on all of our nations to hold accountable those responsible.  Failing to do so will only fuel their sense of impunity and embolden others inclined to disregard the maritime order.</p>
<p class="p1">In the Black Sea, the Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov, we see continued aggressive actions against Ukraine with dangerous incursions on the sea and in the air and the harassment of vessels, which are disrupting commerce and energy access.  We reaffirm our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, extending to its territorial waters.  Crimea is Ukraine.</p>
<p class="p1">When nations ignore or purport to redraw the borders of other nations, whether by land or by sea, they undermine the sovereign equality of member-states, a guiding principle of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="p1">Non-state actors also pose serious risk to maritime safety and security, from pirates and illicit maritime traffickers in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, to pirates and armed robbers in the Gulf of Guinea, to drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea and the Eastern Pacific.  Yet our collective response to these actors shows how effective we can be when we work together to defend maritime order and hold those accountable who violate it.</p>
<p class="p1">We see that in the Africa-led Yaounde Architecture for Maritime Safety and Security, which was supported by Friends of the Gulf of Guinea, and in the Nigerian-led Deep Blue Project and Maritime Collaborative Forum.  We see it in India’s Maritime Fusion Center, which has enhanced cooperation among Indian Ocean partners, and in the widespread ratification by countries of the Caribbean Basin of the Treaty of San Jose.</p>
<p class="p1">We see it in the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, which has demonstrated significant success in building an effective regional response, most notably in law enforcement.  The United States led the creation of this group and we remain active in its work and in coordinating naval operations to prevent a resurgence of piracy in the area.  We’re grateful to fellow Security Council members for supporting annual resolutions to help coordinate and strengthen these efforts.</p>
<p class="p1">We must bring the same coordinated and comprehensive responses to other threats to maritime safety and security.  This includes illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which undermines the sustainability of fish stocks, circumvents agreed conservation and management measures, and violate the sovereign rights of coastal states, and often goes hand in hand with the use of forced labor and other illicit activities.  And it also includes responding to environmental disasters, like the cooperation between Sri Lanka, the United States, and other countries to mitigate the impact of the <i>MV X-Press Pearl</i> catastrophe.</p>
<p class="p1">All of these activities require that we share information and coordinate our responses, that we help build the capacity of our maritime partners, that we engage with affected communities, industry, nongovernmental organizations, which are critically important allies in this effort.</p>
<p class="p1">Together, our nations have spent decades building this maritime order and the broader rules-based international system that it is a part of.  We’ve done so out of a shared recognition that it benefits all our nations and all our people when governments accept certain constraints on their actions rather than living in a world where the strong do what they can and where those who are less powerful feel coerced and threatened.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s never been more true than it is today, and that makes the collective effort to defend, to strengthen, and build upon this order more urgent than ever.  Thanks very much.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p class="p1">On the one-year anniversary of Belarus’s fraudulent presidential election, the United States government has taken decisive action against forty-four individuals and entities in order to hold <span class="s1">Alyaksandr</span> Lukashenka and his regime to account for its continued, violent repression of Belarusians inside and outside the country.  These steps are a further consequence to the Belarusian authorities’ continued flagrant disregard for human rights and Belarus’s failure to comply with its obligations under international human rights law.</p>
<p class="p2">Pursuant to a new Executive Order the President signed today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated forty-four individuals and entities. These sanctions are the latest in a series of efforts demonstrating our determination to take action in the face of the increased repression and sharply deteriorating human rights situation in Belarus.  <span class="s2">OFAC targeted, among others, entities and individuals, including state-owned enterprises, government officials, and others, who support the regime, facilitate its violent repression of the Belarusian people, and violate the rule of law.  </span></p>
<p class="p1">Democratic countries are stronger when they stand together. Alongside these U.S. actions, we welcome the steps taken today by the United Kingdom and Canada against the regime and those announced by the European Union on June 24. The United States further commends the ongoing close coordination with Lithuania and Poland as a demonstration of the steadfast international resolve in supporting the Belarusian people’s democratic aspirations.</p>
<p class="p2">One year ago, the people of Belarus turned out in record numbers to give voice to their democratic aspirations and desire for change.  Instead of honoring their votes, the regime fraudulently declared victory and embarked on a campaign of violence and repression.  Since that time, Lukashenka has sought to cement his hold on power at the expense of the Belarusian people.  Over 600 political prisoners are unjustly detained.  Independent media outlets have been raided and shuttered, and Belarusian authorities are attempting to silence NGOs and vital members of civil society.  Moreover, this repression does not occur solely within Belarus’s borders, as Belarusians abroad also face intimidation.  This repression features blatant disregard of international norms, as displayed by the brazen forced diversion of Ryanair flight 4978 for the purpose of arresting a Belarusian journalist, the dangerous attempt to intimidate the EU – in particular, our Ally Lithuania – by orchestrating irregular migrant flows on Belarus’s border, and most recently the attempted forced repatriation of Belarusian Olympian Krystsyna Tsimanouskaya, who has been offered a humanitarian visa by Poland.  These acts of transnational repression cannot be tolerated and must stop.  The United States stands in solidarity with our Allies and partners in responding to these threats.</p>
<p class="p1">The United States once again calls on the Belarusian authorities to end the crackdown on members of civil society, the media, athletes, students, legal professionals and other citizens, immediately release all political prisoners, engage in a genuine dialogue with the democratic opposition and civil society, as called for in the OSCE Expert Mission report, and hold free and fair elections under international observation.  We will continue working with the international community to hold to account those responsible for human rights violations and abuses in Belarus.</p>
<p class="p2">We stand with the people of Belarus in support of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) newest report makes it clear – climate change is already a crisis.   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, the United States joined nearly 200 IPCC member governments in approving the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report.  This is the first volume in a series of four reports that the IPCC will release for the Sixth Assessment.  This report evaluates the physical science of climate change – looking at the past, present, and future climate and revealing how human-caused emissions are altering our planet and what that means for our collective future.   </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The report highlights that our climate is rapidly changing due to human influence and is already altering our planet in drastic ways <i>– </i>Arctic sea ice is at its lowest level in more than 150 years; sea levels are rising faster than at any time in at least the last 3,000 years; and glaciers are declining at a rate unprecedented in at least 2,000 years.  Weather and climate events – such as extreme heat, heavy rainfall, fire conditions, and droughts – are becoming more severe and frequent because of clima</span><span class="s2">te change.  We are seeing the detrimental impacts of these events on the lives and livelihoods of people around the world.     </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most importantly, the report finds we are already edging closer to a 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer world, and every day emissions rise the prospects for averting the worst impacts of climate change become dimmer.  This is why it is essential that all countries </span><span class="s3">–</span><span class="s1"> in particular the major economies </span><span class="s3">–</span><span class="s1"> do their part during this critical decade of the 2020s to put the world on a trajectory to keep a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on warming within reach.  This is why the United States has committed to a 50-52 percent reduction in emissions from 2005 levels in 2030 and is marshaling the entire federal government to tackle the climate crisis.  We cannot delay ambitious climate action any longer.   </span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As countries prepare for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, this report is a stark reminder that we must let science drive us to action.  This moment requires world leaders, the private sector, and individuals to act together with urgency and do everything it takes to protect our planet and our future in this decade and beyond.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Rosario Murillo&#8217;s decision on August 6 to ban the last genuine opposition party from participating in the November elections underscores their desire to remain in power at all costs.   This autocratic maneuver follows the detention of seven presidential candidates and 24 other opposition figures, human rights activists, business leaders, students, and NGO workers over the last two months.  The United States views the regime’s latest undemocratic, authoritarian actions—driven by Ortega’s fear of an electoral loss—as the final blow against Nicaragua’s prospects for a free and fair election later this year.  That electoral process, including its eventual results, has lost all credibility.</p>
<p>The Ortega-Murillo regime has undermined its  international commitments, including those under the Inter-American Democratic Charter, as well as the rights of the Nicaraguan people to freely choose their own leaders.  We will continue to work closely with other democracies to respond diplomatically and economically to these dire developments, which only further deprive the Nicaraguan people of their desire for a representative government and economic prosperity.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>I am announcing the designation of five terrorist leaders in Africa. Bonomade Machude Omar, Sidan ag Hitta, Salem ould Breihmatt, Ali Mohamed Rage, and Abdikadir Mohamed Abdikadir are designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) under Executive Order 13224, as amended.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bonomade Machude Omar, also known as Abu Sulayfa Muhammad and Ibn Omar, leads the Military and External Affairs Departments for ISIS-Mozambique and serves as the senior commander and lead coordinator for all attacks conducted by the group in northern Mozambique, as well as the lead facilitator and communications conduit for the group.  During the March 2021 attack on Palma, Omar led one group of fighters while Abu Yasir Hassan, the leader of ISIS-Mozambique, led another group of fighters, and Omar also led the attack on the Amarula Hotel in Palma.  Omar has been responsible for attacks in Cabo Delgado Province, Mozambique, and Mtwara Region, Tanzania.</li>
<li>Sidanag Hitta, also known as Abu Qarwaniand Abu Abdelhakim al-Kidali, is a senior leader and commander responsible for the Kidal Region in Mali within Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM). Hitta was among the group responsible for the January 20, 2019, attack on the MINUSMA base in Aguelhoc, Kidal Region, Mali.  He was also responsible for hostages in the Kidal Region.</li>
<li>Salem ould Breihmatt, also known as Abu Hamza al-Shanqitiand Hamza al-Mauritani, is a JNIM senior leader and emir of Arbinda and Serma in the Mopti Region of Mali. He is also charged with the oversight of JNIM in Burkina Faso and is an explosives expert and instructor.</li>
<li>Ali Mohamed Rage, also known as Ali Dheere, is al-Shabaab’s spokesman and a senior leader of the group.  He replaced Sheikh Mukhtar Robowas al-Shabaab’s top spokesman in May 2009.  Rage has been involved in attack planning that has targeted areas in Kenya and Somalia.</li>
<li>Abdikadir Mohamed Abdikadir, also known as Ikrima, is a facilitator and operational planner.  As of November 2019, Abdikadir was an al-Shabaab senior leader and served as the Head of Operations and Logistics.  Abdikadir had also directed previous attack planning for al-Shabaab.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of our actions today, among other consequences, all property and interests in property of these individuals must be blocked and reported to the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). In addition, persons that engage in certain transactions with the persons designated today may themselves be exposed to designation.  Furthermore, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates a significant financial transaction or provides significant financial services for the persons designated today could be subject to U.S. correspondent account or payable-through account sanctions.</p>
<p>The United States is committed to disrupting the financing methods of ISIS-Mozambique, JNIM, and al-Shabaab &#8212; all of which are designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations and SDGTs &#8212; limiting their abilities to conduct further attacks against civilians and supporting our partners in efforts to disrupt terrorism finance.  Addressing the terrorist threat across the continent will require working closely with our partners to degrade the capacity and operations of these terrorist groups, combatting their control and influence in West, East, and Southern Africa.</p>

<p>The United States condemns in the strongest terms Hizballah’s rocket attacks into Israel. This violence puts Israelis and Lebanese at risk and jeopardizes Lebanon’s stability and sovereignty.  The United States remains engaged with Israeli and Lebanese officials, as well as the Lebanese Armed Forces. We call upon the Lebanese government urgently to prevent such attacks and bring the area under its control.  We also urge the Lebanese government to facilitate full access for UNIFIL peacekeepers in accordance with UNSCR 1701. We strongly encourage all efforts to maintain calm.</p>
