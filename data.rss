<p>The United States welcomes the visit by Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid to the Kingdom of Morocco for the reopening of the Israeli Liaison Office in Rabat.  Foreign Minister Lapid’s trip — the first to Morocco by an Israeli Foreign Minister since the agreement to establish full diplomatic relations between the State of Israel and the Kingdom of Morocco was announced — and the reopening of the Israeli Liaison Office in Rabat are significant for Israel, Morocco, and the broader region.  The United States will continue to work with Israel and Morocco to strengthen all aspects of our partnerships and create a more peaceful, secure, and prosperous future for all the people of the Middle East.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>We are deeply concerned that Poland’s parliament passed legislation today severely restricting the process for Holocaust survivors and their families, as well as other Jewish and non-Jewish property owners, to obtain restitution for property wrongfully confiscated during Poland’s communist era.  We urge that President Duda not sign the bill into law or that, in line with the authority granted to him as President, he refer the bill to Poland’s constitutional tribunal.  A comprehensive law for resolving confiscated property claims is needed to provide some measure of justice for victims.  Such a law would benefit many Polish citizens, as well as people who were forced to leave Poland during and after World War II and who subsequently became naturalized citizens of other countries.  Until such a law is enacted, the pathway to compensation should not be closed for new claims or those pending decisions in administrative courts.</p>
<p>The United States is also deeply troubled by draft legislation passed today by the lower house of the Polish parliament that targets the most watched independent news station, which is also one of the largest U.S. investments in the country.  Poland has worked for decades to foster a vibrant and free media.  This draft legislation would significantly weaken the media environment the Polish people have worked so long to build.  A free and independent media makes our democracies stronger, the Transatlantic Alliance more resilient, and is fundamental to the bilateral relationship.  Large U.S. commercial investments in Poland tie our prosperity together and enhance our collective security.  This draft legislation threatens media freedom and could undermine Poland’s strong investment climate.</p>
<p>Poland is an important NATO Ally that understands the Transatlantic Alliance is based on mutual commitments to shared democratic values and prosperity.  These pieces of legislation run counter to the principles and values for which modern, democratic nations stand.  We urge the government of Poland to demonstrate its commitment to these shared principles not only in words, but also in deeds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:07 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Good afternoon.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-SUMMITFORDEMOCRACY"></a><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Few things at the top and then we’ll get right to your questions. First, as you know, President Biden pledged to host a summit for democracy to reinforce United States commitment to placing democracy and human rights at the center of our foreign policy. And earlier today, the White House announced that President Biden will host two summits. The first will be a virtual event on December 9th and 10th, 2021. The second, which we intend to be in person, will be held approximately a year later. Both summits will bring together established and emerging democracies, civil society, and the private sector to solicit innovative and bold commitments to defend against authoritarianism, address and fight corruption, and promote respect for human rights both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The summit for democracy reflects President Biden’s deeply held belief that in order to tackle the world’s most pressing challenges, democracies must come together, learn together, stand together, and act together. We will have more details to share in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-ISRAELLMOROCCO"></a> Next, we enthusiastically congratulate two close partners, Morocco and Israel, as Morocco today welcomes Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid on his first visit to the kingdom, another important step in the strengthening of their relationship. We believe the normalized relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors create new opportunities for peace and prosperity to flourish in the region. The Morocco-Israel relationship has already led to real benefits for both countries, including direct commercial flights, economic cooperation, and the opening of liaison offices.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-CUBA"></a> Today marks one month since the Cuban people took to the streets, making a call for freedom heard around the world. The Cuban Government responded with a brutal wave of repression unseen in decades. As of today, over 800 Cubans have been reported detained for peacefully demonstrating on July 11th. By some accounts, there may be hundreds more. Many are held incommunicado, without access to family or legal representation; secret, summary judicial proceedings lack fair trial guarantees and seek to repress, to silence, and make examples of anyone who added their voice to peaceful protests on July 11th.</p>
<p>The Government of Cuba denies this systematic abuse of human rights and refuses access to international observers. Cuba’s leaders are counting on the world to turn a blind eye to their repression. The world must not look away. The United States will not look away. We join the families who are suffering and scared, Cuba’s human rights defenders, and those who share our concern around the world in calling for the immediate release of all those detained or missing for merely exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.</p>
<p>Addressing the ongoing crisis in Cuba is a top priority. At President Biden’s direction, the U.S. Government is actively focused on providing support to the Cuban people, whether it is facilitating humanitarian assistance or information access. We’ve brought to bear the strength of international diplomacy, rallying nations around the world to speak out in support of the Cuban people and in condemnation of the regime’s violent response to the protests. And we are holding the repressors accountable for human rights abuses through the Global Magnitsky sanctions program.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-SYRIA"></a> And finally, today is August 11th. It’s the 40th birthday of journalist Austin Tice. This week also marks his ninth year in captivity in Syria. Austin’s release and return home are long overdue. We call on Syria to help release Austin Tice and every U.S. citizen held hostage in Syria. Secretary Blinken is personally dedicated to seeking the safe release of U.S. hostages and wrongful detainees. We will continue to pursue all paths that may lead to Austin’s safe return home.</p>
<p>With that, Matt.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-UKDEPARTMENT"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks. Just before we get to what I’m sure will be Afghanistan, I just want to – on the administration’s commitment to democracy, human rights, which I think includes freedom of the press and your support for that, I just wanted to ask you really quickly about the situation with Julian Assange in London, the court hearing that was held today. And if you’re only going to refer to the Justice Department, then I don’t need to hear a long explanation of that, but I just – what I want to know is from the State Department’s point of view, because it was State Department equities that were among the first that were compromised, quote/unquote – I mean, you have an interest in – the State Department has an interest in this case. So I’m just wondering if it is still the position of the State Department that Assange is not a journalist and that he is – he should be tried for theft of what are – what you would essentially say are state secrets.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, by referring to the Department of Justice, as we always do in cases like this, it doesn’t indicate &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, no, no, I’m just asking &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It doesn’t indicate we don’t have an interest. It indicates that we have a respect for the separation of institutions and the independence of Department of Justice.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Your – the position of this administration since it came in talking about how important the freedom of press is, has – that hasn’t impacted the department’s position on this case. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> This is a matter before the Department of Justice. It’s a matter the Department of Justice is pursuing.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> It’s not a matter before the Department of Justice. It’s a matter before the British court. But I just want to know if your position, the State Department’s position, that you represent to the Department of Justice who then represents you has changed at all.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Matt, the Department of Justice is pursuing this. I will leave it to them to pursue and to characterize the United States Government’s position on this.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay, so the State Department’s position hasn’t changed, correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Matt, the Department of Justice is speaking for the United States &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Oh, my god.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>&#8212; in a law enforcement matter.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Why can’t you give straight answers? Yes or no, has it changed or not over the course of the last eight years?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>The Department of Justice in this matter &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I am fully aware, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Matt, you don’t need to be combative, okay? You don’t need to be combative.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I – I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>I know you like to get worked up, but please, this is &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I’m not trying to get worked up. I just want a straight answer. Did &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>It’s a simple matter that’s before the Department of Justice.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-AFGHANISTAN"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Fine. All right. So in terms of your grand promotion of democracy, human rights, which are going to be at the center of U.S. foreign policy, as we will see no doubt in December when the President hosts his summit of – for democracy, how does that relate exactly to Afghanistan and your promotion of human rights and democracy when you have a situation where the country is rapidly coming under control of a group that has shown no respect for democracy and human rights ever?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>I’m sorry, the question was &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>How do you reconcile this? How do you – how does the administration expect to be taken seriously in terms of promoting human rights and democracy as being at the center of U.S. foreign policy if it is prepared to allow Afghanistan to deteriorate into a situation where a group that has shown – that you yourself just days ago have accused of committing atrocities – if you’re prepared to allow that to happen.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>I would reject every single premise of that question. The United States &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Really? Because most of what I just said is actual – is factual.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>The United States – I think it is undeniable – has over the course of 20 years done more to support the cause of the Afghan people to provide humanitarian support. Just numerically speaking, of course, we are the largest donor, and that includes humanitarian assistance, it includes assistance for the women and girls of Afghanistan, for Afghanistan’s minorities. That won’t change.</p>
<p>I would also reject the premise that we are just prepared to watch and do nothing as the violence escalates. That could not be farther from the truth. The truth, Matt, is that on every count, on every score, the United States over the course of the past 20 years and now going forward is, I would dare say, doing more than any country to try to bring stability, security, and ultimately prosperity to the people of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Now, it is true that our tactics are changing, that the President has made the decision to withdraw our military forces. That says nothing about our support for the rights of the people of Afghanistan and what we will continue – what we have done and will continue to strive to do to bring stability and security to the people of Afghanistan right now as we speak through a diplomatic process. And I know you tend to discount diplomacy, at least in this case.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Tend to? No, no, not tend to. (Laughter.) I just don’t think and I don’t see how you can realistically think that it’s going to accomplish anything because it hasn’t in the past. And you say you reject the premise that you’re prepared to sit by and watch and do nothing. Well, what have you done over the course of the last couple weeks as these atrocities that you’ve talked about have mounted, as the Taliban has taken over more and more territory? What exactly has it been that you have done?</p>
<p>You said that you weren’t going to sit – stand – sit back and do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Yep, happy to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Happy to reiterate much of what we’ve done, of course. We’ve spoken of our humanitarian assistance, which is directly relevant to the current and future conditions of the Afghan people, including its women and girls and Afghanistan’s minorities as well, just right now, just this week. And again, this is diplomacy, what we think has the potential to lead to a political settlement and a ceasefire. It is ongoing actively right now. There are several rounds of planned meetings this week. The first took place yesterday. There was another one today. There will be another one tomorrow, bringing together representatives from countries in the region and well beyond as well as from multilateral institutions &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> These are all in Doha?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> &#8212; I’m sorry, in Doha – to press for a reduction of violence and a ceasefire and a commitment on the part of all those in attendance – this constellation of representatives from various countries and international organizations – not to work with any entity that takes the country by force. And so just today, Ambassador Khalilzad and his team participated in a meeting of the extended troika, that is to say the United States, Russia, China, and Pakistan. There, the countries aligned efforts to press the Taliban to reduce violence, to engage seriously and urgently in Afghan peace negotiations, including the fundamental issues needed to resolve that conflict.</p>
<p>I said this started yesterday. Yesterday, Ambassador Khalilzad and his team participated in a meeting on the current situation, including the current levels of violence, with the UN Envoy Jean Arnault and representatives from the region and other international stakeholders. Tomorrow, there will be a broader set of countries we expect that will be – that will come together. And in all of this, it’s our intention to forge consensus and to have the international community, including countries in the region and beyond, to speak with one voice. Both sets of these meetings this week included briefings from both the Islamic Republic – that’s the Afghan Government – and from the Taliban negotiating teams. Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman, is there representing the Afghan Government; Mullah Baradar is there representing the Taliban. This is high-level representation.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The other countries – are you prepared to say or do you know yet who those &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> We’ll – we’ll have more detail on that tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. But the Taliban will be represented in those meetings as well?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yes. There will be a – correct.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is it correct that the Secretary has not spoken to Mullah Baradar or any Taliban member?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> That – that is correct.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So – so he has – his representations about this have been confined to the Afghan Government, what – in terms of the Afghan people, they’ve been confined to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> It’s been – it has included the Afghan Government. Of course, when he visited Kabul we met with President Ghani, we met with Abdullah Abdullah. It’s multiple conversations with President Ghani.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I just want to make sure because the last secretary of state or the only secretary of state to have spoken with the Taliban directly is – was his predecessor?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> In the context of the conclusion of the U.S.-Taliban agreement. But let me make one other point. Of course, the Secretary has also been actively engaged in speaking with countries – representatives, countries from the region on this.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I – you’re trying to impute some kind of – I just want to know if it’s correct. I’m not saying that that’s good or bad whether he is or not.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> So one &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you happen to know &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> One more point just on this to give you the full context.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And I just have one more and it’s extremely brief because I think the answer is going to be no.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay. Well, Ambassador Khalilzad, in the context of all of this, will meet with each negotiating team separately, as we frequently do, to encourage them to engage productively in this process and, importantly, not to squander this opportunity, which may be an historic opportunity to end what is not &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Wait. Squander this – what opportunity? What are you talking here about?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The opportunity &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The opportunity that was brought about by you guys withdrawing &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>The opportunity &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; which has plunged the country – 65 percent of the country into chaos?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The opportunity of – the opportunity of the Afghan Government and the Taliban and the rest of the world, at least a large swath of the world, coming together. And let me remind you, it’s been less than a year since both the Afghan Government and the Taliban have been willing to talk, have been engaged in intra-Afghan dialogue. So we have an opportunity – we’ve had an – have had an opportunity in recent weeks and months that in many ways Afghanistan has not had over the course of 40 years.</p>
<p>We talk about the past three weeks of violence, the past three months of violence. This has been 40 years of conflict. And so with the Taliban and the Afghan Government now willing to talk to one another, of course, that is a necessary but insufficient step. But what we are doing is galvanizing the international community, supporting these intra-Afghan discussions to attempt to make progress to do a couple of things: to stop this military offensive, diminish the level of violence, and, more broadly, to negotiate a political settlement to form an inclusive Afghan government that ends this conflict.</p>
<p>We remain confident in the fact that this is the only path to stability. We remain cognizant of the fact that this is the only path to stability and development in Afghanistan. So progress has been slow. It has been painfully slow. The violence has been a cause for grave concern. We’ve been very clear about that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I think a lot of people would argue that there’s not been any progress. It’s not been slow; it’s been nonexistent. But anyway, did you ever get an – did you get an answer to the question I had yesterday about whether the Taliban was violating the terms of the February 2020 Doha agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure. Let me add a bit of context there. There are several key parts of this February 2020 agreement for – to highlight. Number one, the Taliban will take specific actions to prevent any group or individual, including al-Qaida, from using Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies. This, of course, incredibly important to us. We have a commitment from the Taliban. We also have capabilities in the region to see to it that this remains the case.</p>
<p>Number two, the United States and coalition partners will withdraw foreign military forces from Afghanistan. This is especially noteworthy in the context of our decision-making process, and it’s something that we obviously talked about at length yesterday.</p>
<p>Number three, the Taliban and the Islamic Republic will launch intra-Afghan negotiations. It’s a point I’ve just made that this – the two sides had not come together until this agreement went into force, and they’ve been meeting now for less than a year, but the very fact that Abdullah Abdullah and Mullah Baradar are in Qatar is a sign of that.</p>
<p>And number four, a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire and agreement over the future political roadmap of Afghanistan will be part of the agenda of the intra-Afghan negotiations. And so this one, that’s particularly relevant to your question on this.</p>
<p>But the way we look at these four elements is that they are linked, they are interrelated. Intra-Afghan negotiations leading to a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire were an integral element of the agreement, and all recent indications, at least, suggest the Taliban are instead pursuing a battlefield victory.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, but they didn’t agree in February 2020 not to seek a battlefield victory against the Afghan Government.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What they agreed to do &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did they or did they not?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What they agreed to do was to seek a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, through these peace talks, which have gone nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Correct, correct. And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did they agree in 2020 – in February 2020 did they agree not to attack Afghan provincial &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What we can say &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; major population centers of the Afghan Government and the Afghan forces?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What we can say &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did they or did they not?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What we can say is that the levels of violence are unacceptably high and what we have seen is inconsistent with the letter and the spirit of the agreement.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But they didn’t actually agree not to attack cities, provincial capitals, big, major population centers, or the Afghan &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, attacking &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; or the Afghan military. Did they?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Attacking – attacking provincial capitals and targeting civilians is inconsistent with the spirit of the agreement. It’s this last clause of the agreement, the key point that I mentioned: a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire agreement over the future political roadmap of Afghanistan &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’ll just put that down as a no.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; will be part of the agenda of the intra-Afghan negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On Afghanistan?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’ll come right back to you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> In terms of, quote, “progress,” I mean, what is the point of even being in Doha on these talks? Let me cite a few things. Not only have they advanced and are in 24 out of 34 provinces and six capitals – however you want to argue it, whatever percentage they’ve taken over – but they are advancing step by step, day by day toward the core of what remains of the Afghan Government’s autonomy, if there is any, in Kabul, as you know better than any of us from just reading the intel. So first of all, there is no progress in these talks. If the fourth part of this is so critical, whether or not it’s ironclad in terms of their attacks against Afghans, what they are doing has been described in some instances as it could be a war crime by the Embassy in Kabul just two weeks ago. That’s number one.</p>
<p>Number two, you talk about our partners and these other countries. Is it consistent with this alleged partnership and agreement that Beijing welcomes the Taliban and confers legitimacy on it, and in their capital?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That’s &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And have we talked with Iran about keeping its border open as hundreds and hundreds of Afghans have been fleeing across that border, and what kind of sustenance can be granted to those refugees as they wait, which you acknowledge is up to 14 months for permission to move on and get any kind of clearance for some of them?</p>
<p>So what is the – what is the future? What I think all of us are trying to get to is, outside the parameters of February 2020, the talks are feckless. If the Taliban participants there have no control over the combatants in the field, then why bother? And if they do, the whole thing is hypocritical and it’s just a delaying tactic until they can take over the country.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> All right, let me try and take much of that on. First, I would make the point that our diplomacy is taking place on two levels. On one level, we are and we always have been supporting the intra-Afghan negotiations. We’re not a direct participant to the talks. These are – these are talks between the Afghan parties.</p>
<p>On another level, we are bringing together much of the rest of the world, the region, and well beyond to define our common concerns with what we’re seeing right now on – that – with the levels of violence, but also to endorse a political roadmap and to encourage a political path forward for the Afghan parties. Of course, any path forward is going to have to be Afghan-owned and Afghan-led. But the international community has a vested interest in seeing an Afghanistan that is secure, that is safe, that is stable, and where the human rights of its people are respected. That is why that’s precisely what Ambassador Khalilzad is doing in Qatar this week. A major item on the agenda is making very clear to the Afghan parties and to the rest of the world that the international community will not accept any government that seeks to take control of Afghanistan by force.</p>
<p>And this is not a point that would be new in the context of this week. It’s really a reaffirmation of this point. You raised the Taliban’s visit to the PRC. The PRC has signed on to any number of affirmations of the fact that any future government in Afghanistan that takes – seeks to take control through the barrel of gun won’t have legitimacy and won’t have their backing. UN Security Council issued a statement last week; of course, China is a permanent member of the council. The last sentence: “The members of the Secretary Council recalled Resolution 2513  2020 and reaffirmed…there is no military solution to the conflict, and declared that they do not support the restoration of the Islamic Emirate.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, there was another extended troika, and that again includes the PRC, Russia, and Pakistan, and us, issued a statement: “We reiterate…there is no military solution in Afghanistan and a negotiated political settlement through an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process is the only way forward for lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>There are any other – any number of other examples we can point to where the PRC has offered very clear statements about where Beijing stands. We have made this point before. Of course, our relationship with the PRC, it’s a complex one; perhaps the most complex bilateral relationship we have. But in many ways our interests are aligned with Beijing when it comes to Afghanistan, the same way – or a similar way, I should say – in which our interests are aligned with any number of other countries in the region. It is in no one’s interest to see an Afghanistan that is stricken with conflict and civil war for another 40 years. It’s certainly not in the interests of the people of Afghanistan, it’s not in the interests of Afghanistan’s neighbors, and it is not ultimately in the interests of the Taliban, which clearly seeks to have a role in Afghan leadership. But it is not – it is neither in their interest to see conflict dominate another four decades, or another single decade, or another single year.</p>
<p>I told you I’d come back over. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, on Afghanistan itself, several countries, including India, are closing down their consulates – several countries, including India, are closing down their consulates or temporarily shutting it down, taking back their citizens from there. Is Afghanistan now landing to the hands of Taliban now? It looks like.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sorry, could you repeat that?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is Afghanistan landing into the hands of Taliban now, the way they are spreading?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we’ve made the point that the levels of violence, what we are seeing now across the country, are of grave concern. It’s of grave concern to us. I think we will hear and have heard in Doha that it is of grave concern to the international community. But at the same time, this is not a foregone conclusion, as many people seem to think, that this will be an inexorable march forward for the Taliban or any other force. And we’ve made this point in several different ways.</p>
<p>It is not – it is quite relevant to what we are seeing now that the Afghan National Security Forces are numerically far superior to the Taliban, what the Taliban can muster. As I said yesterday, they have over 300,000 troops, an air force, special forces, heavy equipment, including heavy equipment that the United States only recently provided. This partnership with the Afghan National Security Forces is – support for the Afghan National Security Forces will continue. It will continue, and a concrete sign of that is President Biden’s budget request in which he requested 3.3 billion for the ANDSF going forward.</p>
<p>So again, the Government in Afghanistan has tools at its disposal, has political support, continues to receive support from the United States to its security sector, and has the wherewithal, certainly on paper, to defend its country. Right now what we see is an issue of leadership. It’s both political and military leadership. We need to see Afghans’ leaders united. We need to see a united front, knowing that they and their forces are fighting for a just cause. They have a credible strategic plan. They have the right tactics, the right execution. The advances we have seen need not continue.</p>
<p>First, the levels of violence – again, unacceptably high. The atrocities that have been reported are repugnant. This is evidence of a force that appears to have no respect for their fellow countrymen and women. It is – these are the tactics of a force that, if that continues, obviously will not have legitimacy on the part of the international community and, importantly, won’t accrue the sort of international assistance that any future government in Afghanistan will need to achieve any semblance of durability. And as I was saying before, it is in no one’s interests – not the Taliban’s interest – to attempt to seize power only to control parts of a country that are riven by conflict, where their hold on power is always in jeopardy.</p>
<p>What we are seeking, what we are supporting is a political settlement, is a diplomatic solution to this that in the first instance is Afghan-owned and Afghan-led but ultimately can lead to a diminution of the violence, a ceasefire, and a durable political outcome going forward.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> One more: What role do you see for India after U.S. withdraws all its troops from Afghanistan? India has been a major donor for Afghanistan’s developmental activities; now it’s – closing down most of those development activities now.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, this goes to what I was saying before, and we have seen a role for India and other countries in the region, knowing that it is a shared and collective interest on the part of Afghanistan’s neighbors and countries further afield for there to be a stable and secure Afghanistan. All countries in the region have a significant stake in that, including India, and we do appreciate India’s strong record of offering development assistance to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>But this has been a primary chore of ours to encourage Afghanistan’s neighbors to continue to do all they can to support the people of Afghanistan and, on a political level, to lend their support and to lend their collective national voices to the ongoing political process and the diplomacy that is taking place in Qatar, that is taking place between the Afghan parties, knowing that in our estimation, in the estimation of much of the international community, that is the only viable and realistic path forward to achieve what we all collectively seek to see fulfilled.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-RUSSIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much. Voice of America Russian service. I have two questions; I will ask them one by one. Today, Russian investigative committee pressed new charges against Russian opposition politician Aleksey Navalny, and he is already in jail. And earlier this year, concern about Navalny’s destiny was expressed at the highest level of the United States by the President. So are you aware of this development? And should we expect some reaction from State Department?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We are aware of this development. Of course, this follows on the heels of the Russian Government’s – not only its arrest and detention of Mr. Navalny but the violent crackdown on the many Russians who peacefully took to the streets to demonstrate against his detention. It follows on the heels of efforts to intimidate and to suppress those organizations, NGOs, independent organizations that are allied with Mr. Navalny. So in many ways, this is just a continuation of a very disturbing pattern. The United States continues to stand on the side and stand with the many Russians who we saw not all that long ago, again, peacefully take to the streets to hold their government to account, to express their aspirations for greater freedoms, to protest the repression and the level of repression that – to which they have been subject. So yes, we’re watching very closely.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And another question: There are some media reports that 27 members of U.S. Congress recently written letter to Secretary Blinken demanding, I quote, “suspension of any export permits for U.S. drone technology to Turkey.” Did you receive this letter, and could you say if department is going to take actions regarding this letter? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>I’ll see if we can get you more information on that.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-AFGHANISTAN2"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And can we get back to Afghanistan really quick, Ned?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Sure. Back in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks. Just really quickly, the behavior by the Taliban that you have described today and have been describing, does the United States see any of that as sanctionable?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>We – as I said yesterday, just as we are investing in a diplomatic process because we are cognizant that only through diplomacy can we achieve the sort of just and durable outcome that we seek to achieve, we will not hesitate to use the carrots and the sticks that are available to us. If we see behavior that would warrant and that would be appropriate for that kind of tool, it is certainly not off the table.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And also a Taliban spokesperson told Axios regarding a question about whether they were concerned about becoming an international pariah that “e have never yielded to any foreign pressure tactics before and we don’t plan to capitulate any time soon either.” The Taliban is blatantly saying that is has no interest nor does it have any interest in being pressured by the international community, so what makes the administration so confident that it can pressure using the international community?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Well, look, I’m not going to engage in a tit for tat with a Taliban spokesperson. I will tell you – and Ambassador Khalilzad has made this point as well – that in discussions with the Taliban, they have been candid and they have said publicly that they did not in the 1990s recognize the importance of international legitimacy, that they did not recognize the advantages it would – that would come with it.</p>
<p>More practically, this is – international legitimacy, of course, it’s a virtue, it’s a good thing, but there are some practical realities that come along with it. And so beyond international approval or condemnation, legitimacy bestows and essentially is the ticket to the levels of international assistance, humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people, international funding and assistance for any future government in Afghanistan. That would be required for any future government, again, to have any semblance of durability. There are other practical implications. They want sanctions lifted, they want the ability to travel, to engage in international diplomacy. None of that would be possible were they to continue down this path, were they to attempt to take the country by force, were they not to respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Afghan people – not only the fundamental rights and freedoms, but going back to Matt’s first question, the hard-won gains of the past 20 years, those gains that the United States was integral to helping the Afghan people secure.</p>
<p>So it is a – it is about much more than legitimacy. It’s about what legitimacy can lead to both for – in terms of support and on the other side of the ledger.</p>
<p>Lara.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So a follow-up on that: Given that any U.S. assistance to the Afghan Government, whether it includes the Taliban in the future or not, would be funneled through the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, have there been any discussions by Ambassador Khalilzad or others in the State Department with the Taliban to assure the security of the U.S. embassy in the future?</p>
<p>And also to follow up on my colleague’s very good question about other diplomatic missions from other countries pulling out of Afghanistan right now, is the United States engaged with discussions with any of those missions to try to persuade them to stay?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>So this is a challenge that we have treated as a collective challenge since not only this administration, but it really goes back to the earliest days of America’s engagement in Afghanistan in 2001. More recently, with the diplomacy, again, we have brought together a broad swath of countries in various formats and forms. The – I can just give you a sampling of some of the countries that have been a part of various elements of this process. I’ve mentioned Russia, China, Pakistan, the EU, France, Germany, Italy, NATO, Norway, the UK, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, NATO, of course, Spain, Sweden, India, Qatar, of course, Turkey, Indonesia – the list goes on. These are countries who have lent their voices, who have lent their – engaged diplomatically in this process. We have, the United States has, on a bilateral and a multilateral basis, discussed our objectives with many of these countries. We have with many, if not most of them, interests that are quite well aligned.</p>
<p>Look, the presence and staffing of any given country in Afghanistan is going to be a sovereign decision. The United States, we have and will continue to make our own decisions based on, first and foremost, the threat assessment, the safety and security of our people. Other countries will be doing the same. We&#8217;ve talked about this in the context of Hamid Karzai International Airport, in the imperative of a functioning and operable international airport, to sustaining the operations at our embassy. It&#8217;s also important to other embassies on the ground. But ultimately, it&#8217;s going to be a question for individual countries as to what they&#8217;re comfortable with, consistent with their interests and their goals. Fortunately, we do share not only goals and interests, but also values with many of these countries as they apply to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Remind me of your first question. Your &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Has Ambassador Khalilzad or anybody else in the State Department discussed the security and the future of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul with the Taliban?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So, of course, the U.S.-Taliban agreement – the Taliban did make commitments when it comes to U.S. forces and coalition forces on the ground. We are taking a number of steps – those include with physical security, that includes with diplomacy – to do everything we can to ensure the safety, security, welfare, and well-being of our diplomats and U.S. Government presence on the ground. But I&#8217;m not in position to detail that further.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. Just to clarify one thing: That long list of countries that you read off, you&#8217;re not saying that they have all committed to keeping their diplomatic missions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No. No, no, no. These are countries that in one form or fashion have made the point that any government that seeks to take Afghanistan by force will lack international legitimacy.</p>
<p>Yes, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yes, staying on Afghanistan, the Taliban issued a statement denying the killing of innocent civilians and driving people from their homes. That&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ve cited evidence saying that that&#8217;s happening. I wonder if that – is it – does the U.S. have its own evidence for that? And Taliban are saying they would be willing to be part of a – to form a team with the UN and the ICRC to conduct some kind of independent investigation. Is that something that you would support? Is that something that&#8217;s been discussed in Doha or – and if it did happen, could it be impartial if it includes members of the Taliban?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I am not aware of any ongoing discussions for a joint investigation the likes of which you described, and that&#8217;s for a very simple reason: There is, everywhere you look, compelling data points, evidence, imagery, of the violence, the bloodshed, the potential atrocities that the Taliban are committing. The embassy has been very clear about this. We have – can see it with our own eyes from some of the footage that&#8217;s emerging. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why we are doing everything we can to accelerate the efforts of the international community to speak with one voice, to condemn what&#8217;s going, and beyond that, to seek a diminution of the violence, a ceasefire, and a political settlement among the parties.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And just to follow up, the – Al Jazeera is reporting that the head of the Afghan Reconciliation Committee is saying the Taliban was not showing seriousness in the peace talks and it&#8217;s clear that they don&#8217;t believe in a political solution. Obviously, you&#8217;ve talked about this, but I wonder if you – people who are involved in these talks don&#8217;t have any faith in the Taliban’s seriousness, so.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s accurate to say the Afghan Government doesn&#8217;t have any faith. The fact that Abdullah Abdullah is there in Qatar, that they are taking – that they have sent a high-level representative this week, I think speaks to the recognition that yes, this process has been too slow, yes, we would like to see these talks achieve meaningful progress. We would have liked to have seen that weeks ago. But despite all the challenges, despite what we’re seeing, that, again, diplomacy is the only means through which we can achieve a diminution of the violence, a ceasefire, and ultimately a just and durable political solution.</p>
<p>The other point that is relevant is that throughout history – and I made this point yesterday – it is not the case that peace talks require peace on the ground. Very rarely have you looked at instances of peace negotiations only to find peace on the ground. So with the levels of violence, we are doing everything we can to encourage the international community to step up, and doing everything we can to support meaningful progress towards diminishing the violence and setting this process back on the path towards a ceasefire and a durable solution. Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-POLAND"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Marcin Wrona, TVN Discovery from Poland. Today the ruling party in Poland is pushing hard in the parliament to pass a law forcing Discovery, an American company and the owner of our network, which is the largest American investment in Poland, out of the country. So in fact the goal is to silence the largest independent TV network in Poland. Do you have a comment on this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I do. Well, first, let me just say thank you for being here. Certainly this law – if this law were to go into force, it would have a very personal impact on you and your colleagues, and we appreciate that and we understand that. And it is part and parcel of the reason why we’ve been so vocal on this.</p>
<p>There are actually two pieces of legislation that are before the Polish parliament. One is the media law you referenced. The other is the Holocaust restitution legislation. We are watching these legislative efforts in Poland on media and Holocaust restitution very closely. Poland is an important NATO Ally that understands, importantly, that the transatlantic alliance is based not only on mutual interests when it comes to our shared security, but also mutual commitments to shared democratic values and prosperity.</p>
<p>When it comes to the media law, we know that a free and independent media – they make our democracies stronger. It makes the transatlantic alliance more resilient, including to those who would seek to divide the alliance and divide us, and it is a fundamental component of our bilateral relationship with Poland. And so that is why we have urged Poland to – the Government of Poland to demonstrate its commitments to these principles, which are indeed shared, not only in words but in deed. And the government now has that opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Let me follow up quickly. Counselor Derek Chollet was in Poland and he talked with the Polish authorities. A bipartisan group from the Senate and also a bipartisan group from the House of Representatives sent letters to the authorities in Poland, and all of that to no effect. So how do you intend to talk with Warsaw? How do you intend to engage with the authorities in Poland?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we have engaged with authorities in Warsaw at very high levels. You did mention Counselor Chollet was there in person. I can tell you that some of the most senior people in this building, including in recent hours, have had discussions with senior Polish officials on these very subjects.</p>
<p>Look, both of these bills are before the Polish parliament. The Government of Poland now has an opportunity to show that both in – to show in deed and not only in word that it stands by the values that unite our transatlantic alliance and the values that bind the United States and Poland. So we’ll be watching very closely.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did you want to say something about the restitution law &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So on the restitution law – this is the other piece of legislation that we are watching very closely and quite concerned with, and we’re concerned by any steps that would impede the ability of Holocaust survivors and their families, as well as other Jewish and non-Jewish property owners, to attain restitution or compensation for property wrongfully confiscated during Poland’s communist era. So we’re also watching that very closely.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. And then you also said that there have been – today, within the last couple hours? Can you be a little bit more specific about who was in touch with the Poles about this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I wouldn’t want to offer any additional detail, but very high levels.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> All right. Okay. Well, as – oh, very high levels? Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you mean the offer that was delayed in Pakistan?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> It was delayed, so do you have any response to the fact that it’s not – that the opposition managed to delay consideration of this until next month?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have a specific comment on that, but we’ll be watching very, very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just a follow-up.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let me move over just to anyone who hasn’t gotten a question. Shaun.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-BELARUS"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just do – stay in the region, on Belarus.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Belarusian – the Lukashenka regime, ordering the United States to reduce its diplomatic presence. Do you have any reaction to that? And in light of the U.S. – Ambassador Fisher’s status, how would the U.S. actually be affected by this order?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sure. Well, as you alluded to, authorities in Minsk today – and this was relayed via the Belarusian ministry of foreign affairs – informed the United States that it is imposing new limits on American diplomatic and technical personnel at our embassy in Minsk effective next month, September 1. The regime has also recalled its agreement to receive Julie Fisher as U.S. ambassador to Belarus. It is important to remember in all of this and to acknowledge that Belarusian authorities are responsible for the deterioration in U.S.-Belarus relations through relentless repression against their citizens. And that includes through the intensifying crackdowns that we have seen targeting members of civil society, targeting media, targeting athletes, students, legal professionals, and other citizens.</p>
<p>And that’s why in response to these events, the White House and the broader administration announced just this week on August 9th the strongest set of sanctions on the Lukashenko regime to date. What we know is that a sovereign, independent Belarus that respects the democratic will of its citizens, their human rights, and the country’s international obligations, that is in not only the interests of the Belarusian people, but also the United States. We are disappointed to be where we are now in terms of our relationship with Belarus, but we’ll continue to work with our allies and partners to promote shared interests.</p>
<p>When it comes to Ambassador Fisher and your question, the United States Government, Ambassador Fisher, personnel at our embassy in Minsk, they will continue to support the democratic aspirations of the people of Belarus. U.S. diplomats will continue to engage with Belarusians, including leaders of the pro-democracy movement, media professionals, students, and other elements of civil society, wherever they are.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-SUDAN"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>In the interest of time, let me just go to something else, to Sudan. The transitional government say that they’re willing to hand over Omar al-Bashir to the ICC. That, of course, has long been a goal the of United States. Do you have any reaction to this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Has there been any U.S. discussions with them on this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, we do welcome the reconfirmation by the council of ministers, or the cabinet, of its intention to hand over former President Bashir and other former officials wanted by the ICC for crimes in Darfur. We look forward to joint action by the cabinet and the sovereign council to finalize and execute this decision. We urge Sudan to continue to cooperate with the ICC by handing over those subject to arrest warrants and by cooperating on the provision of the requested evidence. Doing so would be a major step for Sudan in the fight against decades of impunity.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-BELARUS2"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I have just a quick follow-up on Shaun’s Belarus question. I believe the Minsk authorities wanted to reduce the U.S. embassy presence to five. Do you know what it is currently? How much of a decrease of that and how much of a problem would that be for the embassy there?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I don’t have our current staffing figures for the embassy in Minsk, but Belarusian authorities have indicated that they will be reducing the size of their mission to the United States to five diplomats, and have requested that we limit the size of our embassy in Minsk to five American diplomats by the deadline of September 1st.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-AFGHANISTAN3"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Just going back to Rich’s question about sanctions on the Taliban, sort of related to it, yesterday you mentioned that the U.S. was not taking any tools off the table with regard to what it could impose on the Taliban and would use those tools if the State Department deemed them appropriate. It seems like now would be an appropriate time to use any tools the U.S. has at its disposal. So could you maybe go into more detail about what tools you’re referring to and when would be appropriate to use those tools?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, there are any number of forms of leverage that the – our partners in this effort have. I’ve mentioned, both today and yesterday, the leverage that the Government of Afghanistan has in the form – in many ways, but of course, importantly, in the form of its armed forces – 300,000 trained soldiers, an air force, heavy equipment, continuing support from the United States. There are other countries in the region that can exert influence and leverage over the Taliban.</p>
<p>We are – this is part of why we are continuing to galvanize international attention, international support to the diplomacy. We have, the United States has important sources of leverage too. That includes both carrots and sticks. I don’t think it’s prudent for us to preview what we might do, but the fact is that we will not hesitate – if we think it will be in the interests of the people of Afghanistan, if we think it is an appropriate recourse – to use any and all tools at our disposal. The one tool we have taken off the table, of course, is the reintroduction of U.S. service members, because this President, in the priority he attaches that he attaches to the safety, security of American citizens, including of course our service members. We have concluded that the United States will no longer use our service members as sources of leverage in a negotiation, something that had not borne fruit previously. Beyond that, though, we have any number of sources of leverage and we’ll be prepared to use them if it’s appropriate.</p>
<p>Yes. Let me go right over here.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-SUMMITFORDEMOCRACY2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. I’d like to go to the topic of summit of the democracies in December. Has the administration finalized the invitees? How would you draw a line between who is democracy that is qualified to be invited and who isn’t? Because we know that some countries claim they are democracies when they are not in other standards. For example, China claims that it has its own brand of democracy with, quote, “Chinese characteristics,” unquote.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> What I can say is that we have reached out to a regionally diverse set of both well-established as well as emerging democracies whose progress and commitments will advance a more just and peaceful world.</p>
<p>Our goal in all of this in putting together the virtual summit for later this year is to be as inclusive as possible, and of course we have to do so within logistical constraints. But we are, therefore, considering additional opportunities to ensure that even beyond this virtual gathering, all relevant voices and viewpoints can feed into the summit process. And we’ll continue working with summit participants and other governments around the world to – and let me just say, those other participants include nongovernmental participants, nongovernmental stakeholders, civil society, and other actors to address democratic backsliding, promote respect for human rights, defend against corruption both at home and abroad, whether that work occurs within or outside of the summit framework.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So having the private sector involved, would you be strengthening, like, technology security and supply chain issues and all of those topics? Could you give us some more color to what the summit would look like?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we’ll have much more on this in the coming weeks. But let me just say that this summit, as we see it, is an opportunity to engage, listen, and speak honestly about the challenges that democracies face. It’s an opportunity to work together with likeminded governments, civil society, and the private sector on meaningful new commitments and new initiatives and to cooperatively build a foundation for democratic renewal globally.</p>
<p>This is not just a forum for sharing thoughts. This is a forum for putting forward concrete ideas, concrete commitments. That is part of what we have solicited in our initial outreach to countries around the world, asking them to be bold, to be ambitious in terms of what they might be able to bring forward, and we look forward to having that discussion with participants in the coming weeks and several months.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-NORTHKOREA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just have one more question on North Korea?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. North Korea has issued a warning to U.S. and South Korea again. It said the U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise risks provoking, quote, “a serious security crisis.” With consecutive statements coming from the DPRK’s senior officials, does the U.S. see this North Korea action as escalating tension?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> Look, I don’t want to – I wouldn’t want to offer an assessment as to what may or may not be the message from the DPRK. What I will do is reiterate our message, and it’s a very simple one. The joint military exercises, they are purely defensive in nature. We have long maintained the United States harbors no hostile intent towards the DPRK. We remain – it is true we remain committed to the security of the Republic of Korea and our defined – combined defense posture in accordance with the ironclad alliance we have with the ROK.</p>
<p>We support intra-Korean dialogue, we support intra-Korean engagement, and will continue to work with our ROK partners to that end.</p>
<p>A couple final questions, Andrea and Simon.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-AFGHANISTAN4"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You talked about using all leverage with the Taliban. Are you prepared to use leverage against American banks who, according to a lawsuit filed by Gold Star families, including the family of Anne Smedinghoff, a revered and decorated Foreign Service officer who lost her life in 2013 in Afghanistan, to go after banks that are headquartered here that are allegedly money-laundering and getting money to the Taliban?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Our efforts when it comes to illicit finance, we have many tools at our disposal. Again, I think it is far too tactical for me to entertain a question like that from here at this point. But the point remains we are and will be prepared to use any tool that in our estimation can provide – would provide an advantage to what we seek to do. And ultimately, that is to bring about stability, security to the people of Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Could you take a question on that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’ll see if we can provide anything, but I just don’t think we’re going to be in a position to offer anything specific.</p>
<p>Simon.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-BURMA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You had at the top some comments about Austin Tice. There’s another American who’s detained overseas, Danny Fenster in Myanmar. I saw – I wanted to bring to your attention his brother, Bryan Fenster, on Twitter he acted – he tagged you in his tweet but I don’t think you responded, but he’s asking for – there’s a – the fact that there’s an American journalist still wrongly imprisoned 80 days later in Myanmar. What is the Biden administration doing to bring Danny Fenster home?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, this is a priority for us. It’s a priority for us for a couple of reasons. As we’ve said about Austin Tice, the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens is – it’s a highest priority of the U.S. Government, and we remain deeply concerned over the continued detention of Danny Fenster, who was working as a journalist in Burma. We are closely monitoring his situation. We continue to press Burma’s military regime to release Danny immediately. We will do so until he is able to return home safely to his family. Danny is a journalist, as I said. We’ll also continue to make the point that journalism is not a crime. A free and independent media, it’s indispensable to building prosperous, resilient, free societies. The continued detention of Danny, the arrests of other journalists, the use, the employment of the Burmese military against members of the media – that constitutes an unacceptable attack on freedom of expression in Burma. Consular officers have spoken with Danny several times by phone. Members of his family have also been on those calls. And we’ll continue to urge Burmese authorities to effect his immediate release. That continues to be our goal.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is that contact with consular officials ongoing? Because there was a protest in the Insein Prison and I think they lost contact for a while. At the moment, they’re in regular contact?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It has been – it has been several weeks, I understand, since we’ve been able to be in contact. But consular officers, the embassy in Burma is following this case very closely.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-UKDEPARTMENT2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, if it’s the case that journalism is not a crime, then why do you have a problem saying that what you believe – that you do not believe that Julian Assange is a journalist? Or – or you do believe that he’s a journalist and you just don’t care?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> No, it’s actually a procedural issue. The fact that he &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So journalism is not a crime, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Journalism is not a crime, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, but not in the case of Julian Assange? Or you don’t believe he’s a journalist? If you – it’s a really – it’s a binary choice.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> It’s really easy, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The Department of Justice is handling this matter, okay?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Journalism is not a crime.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We have made that very clear.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But unless it’s Julian Assange. Or you don’t believe that he’s a journalist.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, you can talk to the Department of Justice. They have put forward &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I sit here every day.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; public charging documents and other documents. I would refer you to those. When you ask about pending cases, whether the case is an extradition of Julian Assange or anyone else &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> He just asked about a pending case in Burma, and you were &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Not an extradition case, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, no, but I mean you – but &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> No, but it is – it’s very simple. Matt, it’s &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Danny Fenster has been &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It’s very simple, and I’m surprised you’re having trouble understanding. We don’t speak to extradition cases.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m asking you not about an extradition case.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> You are asking &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m asking you whether you believe Julian Assange is a journalist or not.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> You are asking me about &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How is that &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> You are &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How does that have anything to do with extradition? Do you believe that what he was doing is journalism or not?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Thank you all very much.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 3:14 p.m.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:07 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Good afternoon.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-SUMMITFORDEMOCRACY"></a><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Few things at the top and then we’ll get right to your questions. First, as you know, President Biden pledged to host a summit for democracy to reinforce United States commitment to placing democracy and human rights at the center of our foreign policy. And earlier today, the White House announced that President Biden will host two summits. The first will be a virtual event on December 9th and 10th, 2021. The second, which we intend to be in person, will be held approximately a year later. Both summits will bring together established and emerging democracies, civil society, and the private sector to solicit innovative and bold commitments to defend against authoritarianism, address and fight corruption, and promote respect for human rights both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The summit for democracy reflects President Biden’s deeply held belief that in order to tackle the world’s most pressing challenges, democracies must come together, learn together, stand together, and act together. We will have more details to share in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-ISRAELLMOROCCO"></a> Next, we enthusiastically congratulate two close partners, Morocco and Israel, as Morocco today welcomes Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid on his first visit to the kingdom, another important step in the strengthening of their relationship. We believe the normalized relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors create new opportunities for peace and prosperity to flourish in the region. The Morocco-Israel relationship has already led to real benefits for both countries, including direct commercial flights, economic cooperation, and the opening of liaison offices.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-CUBA"></a> Today marks one month since the Cuban people took to the streets, making a call for freedom heard around the world. The Cuban Government responded with a brutal wave of repression unseen in decades. As of today, over 800 Cubans have been reported detained for peacefully demonstrating on July 11th. By some accounts, there may be hundreds more. Many are held incommunicado, without access to family or legal representation; secret, summary judicial proceedings lack fair trial guarantees and seek to repress, to silence, and make examples of anyone who added their voice to peaceful protests on July 11th.</p>
<p>The Government of Cuba denies this systematic abuse of human rights and refuses access to international observers. Cuba’s leaders are counting on the world to turn a blind eye to their repression. The world must not look away. The United States will not look away. We join the families who are suffering and scared, Cuba’s human rights defenders, and those who share our concern around the world in calling for the immediate release of all those detained or missing for merely exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.</p>
<p>Addressing the ongoing crisis in Cuba is a top priority. At President Biden’s direction, the U.S. Government is actively focused on providing support to the Cuban people, whether it is facilitating humanitarian assistance or information access. We’ve brought to bear the strength of international diplomacy, rallying nations around the world to speak out in support of the Cuban people and in condemnation of the regime’s violent response to the protests. And we are holding the repressors accountable for human rights abuses through the Global Magnitsky sanctions program.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-SYRIA"></a> And finally, today is August 11th. It’s the 40th birthday of journalist Austin Tice. This week also marks his ninth year in captivity in Syria. Austin’s release and return home are long overdue. We call on Syria to help release Austin Tice and every U.S. citizen held hostage in Syria. Secretary Blinken is personally dedicated to seeking the safe release of U.S. hostages and wrongful detainees. We will continue to pursue all paths that may lead to Austin’s safe return home.</p>
<p>With that, Matt.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-UKDEPARTMENT"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks. Just before we get to what I’m sure will be Afghanistan, I just want to – on the administration’s commitment to democracy, human rights, which I think includes freedom of the press and your support for that, I just wanted to ask you really quickly about the situation with Julian Assange in London, the court hearing that was held today. And if you’re only going to refer to the Justice Department, then I don’t need to hear a long explanation of that, but I just – what I want to know is from the State Department’s point of view, because it was State Department equities that were among the first that were compromised, quote/unquote – I mean, you have an interest in – the State Department has an interest in this case. So I’m just wondering if it is still the position of the State Department that Assange is not a journalist and that he is – he should be tried for theft of what are – what you would essentially say are state secrets.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, by referring to the Department of Justice, as we always do in cases like this, it doesn’t indicate &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, no, no, I’m just asking &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It doesn’t indicate we don’t have an interest. It indicates that we have a respect for the separation of institutions and the independence of Department of Justice.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Your – the position of this administration since it came in talking about how important the freedom of press is, has – that hasn’t impacted the department’s position on this case. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> This is a matter before the Department of Justice. It’s a matter the Department of Justice is pursuing.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> It’s not a matter before the Department of Justice. It’s a matter before the British court. But I just want to know if your position, the State Department’s position, that you represent to the Department of Justice who then represents you has changed at all.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Matt, the Department of Justice is pursuing this. I will leave it to them to pursue and to characterize the United States Government’s position on this.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay, so the State Department’s position hasn’t changed, correct?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Matt, the Department of Justice is speaking for the United States &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Oh, my god.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>&#8212; in a law enforcement matter.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Why can’t you give straight answers? Yes or no, has it changed or not over the course of the last eight years?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>The Department of Justice in this matter &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I am fully aware, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Matt, you don’t need to be combative, okay? You don’t need to be combative.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I – I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>I know you like to get worked up, but please, this is &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I’m not trying to get worked up. I just want a straight answer. Did &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>It’s a simple matter that’s before the Department of Justice.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-AFGHANISTAN"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Fine. All right. So in terms of your grand promotion of democracy, human rights, which are going to be at the center of U.S. foreign policy, as we will see no doubt in December when the President hosts his summit of – for democracy, how does that relate exactly to Afghanistan and your promotion of human rights and democracy when you have a situation where the country is rapidly coming under control of a group that has shown no respect for democracy and human rights ever?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>I’m sorry, the question was &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>How do you reconcile this? How do you – how does the administration expect to be taken seriously in terms of promoting human rights and democracy as being at the center of U.S. foreign policy if it is prepared to allow Afghanistan to deteriorate into a situation where a group that has shown – that you yourself just days ago have accused of committing atrocities – if you’re prepared to allow that to happen.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>I would reject every single premise of that question. The United States &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Really? Because most of what I just said is actual – is factual.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>The United States – I think it is undeniable – has over the course of 20 years done more to support the cause of the Afghan people to provide humanitarian support. Just numerically speaking, of course, we are the largest donor, and that includes humanitarian assistance, it includes assistance for the women and girls of Afghanistan, for Afghanistan’s minorities. That won’t change.</p>
<p>I would also reject the premise that we are just prepared to watch and do nothing as the violence escalates. That could not be farther from the truth. The truth, Matt, is that on every count, on every score, the United States over the course of the past 20 years and now going forward is, I would dare say, doing more than any country to try to bring stability, security, and ultimately prosperity to the people of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Now, it is true that our tactics are changing, that the President has made the decision to withdraw our military forces. That says nothing about our support for the rights of the people of Afghanistan and what we will continue – what we have done and will continue to strive to do to bring stability and security to the people of Afghanistan right now as we speak through a diplomatic process. And I know you tend to discount diplomacy, at least in this case.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Tend to? No, no, not tend to. (Laughter.) I just don’t think and I don’t see how you can realistically think that it’s going to accomplish anything because it hasn’t in the past. And you say you reject the premise that you’re prepared to sit by and watch and do nothing. Well, what have you done over the course of the last couple weeks as these atrocities that you’ve talked about have mounted, as the Taliban has taken over more and more territory? What exactly has it been that you have done?</p>
<p>You said that you weren’t going to sit – stand – sit back and do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Yep, happy to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Happy to reiterate much of what we’ve done, of course. We’ve spoken of our humanitarian assistance, which is directly relevant to the current and future conditions of the Afghan people, including its women and girls and Afghanistan’s minorities as well, just right now, just this week. And again, this is diplomacy, what we think has the potential to lead to a political settlement and a ceasefire. It is ongoing actively right now. There are several rounds of planned meetings this week. The first took place yesterday. There was another one today. There will be another one tomorrow, bringing together representatives from countries in the region and well beyond as well as from multilateral institutions &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> These are all in Doha?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> &#8212; I’m sorry, in Doha – to press for a reduction of violence and a ceasefire and a commitment on the part of all those in attendance – this constellation of representatives from various countries and international organizations – not to work with any entity that takes the country by force. And so just today, Ambassador Khalilzad and his team participated in a meeting of the extended troika, that is to say the United States, Russia, China, and Pakistan. There, the countries aligned efforts to press the Taliban to reduce violence, to engage seriously and urgently in Afghan peace negotiations, including the fundamental issues needed to resolve that conflict.</p>
<p>I said this started yesterday. Yesterday, Ambassador Khalilzad and his team participated in a meeting on the current situation, including the current levels of violence, with the UN Envoy Jean Arnault and representatives from the region and other international stakeholders. Tomorrow, there will be a broader set of countries we expect that will be – that will come together. And in all of this, it’s our intention to forge consensus and to have the international community, including countries in the region and beyond, to speak with one voice. Both sets of these meetings this week included briefings from both the Islamic Republic – that’s the Afghan Government – and from the Taliban negotiating teams. Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman, is there representing the Afghan Government; Mullah Baradar is there representing the Taliban. This is high-level representation.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The other countries – are you prepared to say or do you know yet who those &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> We’ll – we’ll have more detail on that tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. But the Taliban will be represented in those meetings as well?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yes. There will be a – correct.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is it correct that the Secretary has not spoken to Mullah Baradar or any Taliban member?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> That – that is correct.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So – so he has – his representations about this have been confined to the Afghan Government, what – in terms of the Afghan people, they’ve been confined to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> It’s been – it has included the Afghan Government. Of course, when he visited Kabul we met with President Ghani, we met with Abdullah Abdullah. It’s multiple conversations with President Ghani.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I just want to make sure because the last secretary of state or the only secretary of state to have spoken with the Taliban directly is – was his predecessor?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> In the context of the conclusion of the U.S.-Taliban agreement. But let me make one other point. Of course, the Secretary has also been actively engaged in speaking with countries – representatives, countries from the region on this.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I – you’re trying to impute some kind of – I just want to know if it’s correct. I’m not saying that that’s good or bad whether he is or not.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> So one &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you happen to know &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> One more point just on this to give you the full context.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And I just have one more and it’s extremely brief because I think the answer is going to be no.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay. Well, Ambassador Khalilzad, in the context of all of this, will meet with each negotiating team separately, as we frequently do, to encourage them to engage productively in this process and, importantly, not to squander this opportunity, which may be an historic opportunity to end what is not &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Wait. Squander this – what opportunity? What are you talking here about?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The opportunity &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The opportunity that was brought about by you guys withdrawing &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>The opportunity &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; which has plunged the country – 65 percent of the country into chaos?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The opportunity of – the opportunity of the Afghan Government and the Taliban and the rest of the world, at least a large swath of the world, coming together. And let me remind you, it’s been less than a year since both the Afghan Government and the Taliban have been willing to talk, have been engaged in intra-Afghan dialogue. So we have an opportunity – we’ve had an – have had an opportunity in recent weeks and months that in many ways Afghanistan has not had over the course of 40 years.</p>
<p>We talk about the past three weeks of violence, the past three months of violence. This has been 40 years of conflict. And so with the Taliban and the Afghan Government now willing to talk to one another, of course, that is a necessary but insufficient step. But what we are doing is galvanizing the international community, supporting these intra-Afghan discussions to attempt to make progress to do a couple of things: to stop this military offensive, diminish the level of violence, and, more broadly, to negotiate a political settlement to form an inclusive Afghan government that ends this conflict.</p>
<p>We remain confident in the fact that this is the only path to stability. We remain cognizant of the fact that this is the only path to stability and development in Afghanistan. So progress has been slow. It has been painfully slow. The violence has been a cause for grave concern. We’ve been very clear about that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I think a lot of people would argue that there’s not been any progress. It’s not been slow; it’s been nonexistent. But anyway, did you ever get an – did you get an answer to the question I had yesterday about whether the Taliban was violating the terms of the February 2020 Doha agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure. Let me add a bit of context there. There are several key parts of this February 2020 agreement for – to highlight. Number one, the Taliban will take specific actions to prevent any group or individual, including al-Qaida, from using Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies. This, of course, incredibly important to us. We have a commitment from the Taliban. We also have capabilities in the region to see to it that this remains the case.</p>
<p>Number two, the United States and coalition partners will withdraw foreign military forces from Afghanistan. This is especially noteworthy in the context of our decision-making process, and it’s something that we obviously talked about at length yesterday.</p>
<p>Number three, the Taliban and the Islamic Republic will launch intra-Afghan negotiations. It’s a point I’ve just made that this – the two sides had not come together until this agreement went into force, and they’ve been meeting now for less than a year, but the very fact that Abdullah Abdullah and Mullah Baradar are in Qatar is a sign of that.</p>
<p>And number four, a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire and agreement over the future political roadmap of Afghanistan will be part of the agenda of the intra-Afghan negotiations. And so this one, that’s particularly relevant to your question on this.</p>
<p>But the way we look at these four elements is that they are linked, they are interrelated. Intra-Afghan negotiations leading to a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire were an integral element of the agreement, and all recent indications, at least, suggest the Taliban are instead pursuing a battlefield victory.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, but they didn’t agree in February 2020 not to seek a battlefield victory against the Afghan Government.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What they agreed to do &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did they or did they not?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What they agreed to do was to seek a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, through these peace talks, which have gone nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Correct, correct. And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did they agree in 2020 – in February 2020 did they agree not to attack Afghan provincial &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What we can say &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; major population centers of the Afghan Government and the Afghan forces?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What we can say &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did they or did they not?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What we can say is that the levels of violence are unacceptably high and what we have seen is inconsistent with the letter and the spirit of the agreement.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But they didn’t actually agree not to attack cities, provincial capitals, big, major population centers, or the Afghan &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, attacking &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; or the Afghan military. Did they?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Attacking – attacking provincial capitals and targeting civilians is inconsistent with the spirit of the agreement. It’s this last clause of the agreement, the key point that I mentioned: a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire agreement over the future political roadmap of Afghanistan &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’ll just put that down as a no.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; will be part of the agenda of the intra-Afghan negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On Afghanistan?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’ll come right back to you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> In terms of, quote, “progress,” I mean, what is the point of even being in Doha on these talks? Let me cite a few things. Not only have they advanced and are in 24 out of 34 provinces and six capitals – however you want to argue it, whatever percentage they’ve taken over – but they are advancing step by step, day by day toward the core of what remains of the Afghan Government’s autonomy, if there is any, in Kabul, as you know better than any of us from just reading the intel. So first of all, there is no progress in these talks. If the fourth part of this is so critical, whether or not it’s ironclad in terms of their attacks against Afghans, what they are doing has been described in some instances as it could be a war crime by the Embassy in Kabul just two weeks ago. That’s number one.</p>
<p>Number two, you talk about our partners and these other countries. Is it consistent with this alleged partnership and agreement that Beijing welcomes the Taliban and confers legitimacy on it, and in their capital?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That’s &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And have we talked with Iran about keeping its border open as hundreds and hundreds of Afghans have been fleeing across that border, and what kind of sustenance can be granted to those refugees as they wait, which you acknowledge is up to 14 months for permission to move on and get any kind of clearance for some of them?</p>
<p>So what is the – what is the future? What I think all of us are trying to get to is, outside the parameters of February 2020, the talks are feckless. If the Taliban participants there have no control over the combatants in the field, then why bother? And if they do, the whole thing is hypocritical and it’s just a delaying tactic until they can take over the country.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> All right, let me try and take much of that on. First, I would make the point that our diplomacy is taking place on two levels. On one level, we are and we always have been supporting the intra-Afghan negotiations. We’re not a direct participant to the talks. These are – these are talks between the Afghan parties.</p>
<p>On another level, we are bringing together much of the rest of the world, the region, and well beyond to define our common concerns with what we’re seeing right now on – that – with the levels of violence, but also to endorse a political roadmap and to encourage a political path forward for the Afghan parties. Of course, any path forward is going to have to be Afghan-owned and Afghan-led. But the international community has a vested interest in seeing an Afghanistan that is secure, that is safe, that is stable, and where the human rights of its people are respected. That is why that’s precisely what Ambassador Khalilzad is doing in Qatar this week. A major item on the agenda is making very clear to the Afghan parties and to the rest of the world that the international community will not accept any government that seeks to take control of Afghanistan by force.</p>
<p>And this is not a point that would be new in the context of this week. It’s really a reaffirmation of this point. You raised the Taliban’s visit to the PRC. The PRC has signed on to any number of affirmations of the fact that any future government in Afghanistan that takes – seeks to take control through the barrel of gun won’t have legitimacy and won’t have their backing. UN Security Council issued a statement last week; of course, China is a permanent member of the council. The last sentence: “The members of the Secretary Council recalled Resolution 2513  2020 and reaffirmed…there is no military solution to the conflict, and declared that they do not support the restoration of the Islamic Emirate.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, there was another extended troika, and that again includes the PRC, Russia, and Pakistan, and us, issued a statement: “We reiterate…there is no military solution in Afghanistan and a negotiated political settlement through an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process is the only way forward for lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>There are any other – any number of other examples we can point to where the PRC has offered very clear statements about where Beijing stands. We have made this point before. Of course, our relationship with the PRC, it’s a complex one; perhaps the most complex bilateral relationship we have. But in many ways our interests are aligned with Beijing when it comes to Afghanistan, the same way – or a similar way, I should say – in which our interests are aligned with any number of other countries in the region. It is in no one’s interest to see an Afghanistan that is stricken with conflict and civil war for another 40 years. It’s certainly not in the interests of the people of Afghanistan, it’s not in the interests of Afghanistan’s neighbors, and it is not ultimately in the interests of the Taliban, which clearly seeks to have a role in Afghan leadership. But it is not – it is neither in their interest to see conflict dominate another four decades, or another single decade, or another single year.</p>
<p>I told you I’d come back over. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, on Afghanistan itself, several countries, including India, are closing down their consulates – several countries, including India, are closing down their consulates or temporarily shutting it down, taking back their citizens from there. Is Afghanistan now landing to the hands of Taliban now? It looks like.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sorry, could you repeat that?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is Afghanistan landing into the hands of Taliban now, the way they are spreading?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we’ve made the point that the levels of violence, what we are seeing now across the country, are of grave concern. It’s of grave concern to us. I think we will hear and have heard in Doha that it is of grave concern to the international community. But at the same time, this is not a foregone conclusion, as many people seem to think, that this will be an inexorable march forward for the Taliban or any other force. And we’ve made this point in several different ways.</p>
<p>It is not – it is quite relevant to what we are seeing now that the Afghan National Security Forces are numerically far superior to the Taliban, what the Taliban can muster. As I said yesterday, they have over 300,000 troops, an air force, special forces, heavy equipment, including heavy equipment that the United States only recently provided. This partnership with the Afghan National Security Forces is – support for the Afghan National Security Forces will continue. It will continue, and a concrete sign of that is President Biden’s budget request in which he requested 3.3 billion for the ANDSF going forward.</p>
<p>So again, the Government in Afghanistan has tools at its disposal, has political support, continues to receive support from the United States to its security sector, and has the wherewithal, certainly on paper, to defend its country. Right now what we see is an issue of leadership. It’s both political and military leadership. We need to see Afghans’ leaders united. We need to see a united front, knowing that they and their forces are fighting for a just cause. They have a credible strategic plan. They have the right tactics, the right execution. The advances we have seen need not continue.</p>
<p>First, the levels of violence – again, unacceptably high. The atrocities that have been reported are repugnant. This is evidence of a force that appears to have no respect for their fellow countrymen and women. It is – these are the tactics of a force that, if that continues, obviously will not have legitimacy on the part of the international community and, importantly, won’t accrue the sort of international assistance that any future government in Afghanistan will need to achieve any semblance of durability. And as I was saying before, it is in no one’s interests – not the Taliban’s interest – to attempt to seize power only to control parts of a country that are riven by conflict, where their hold on power is always in jeopardy.</p>
<p>What we are seeking, what we are supporting is a political settlement, is a diplomatic solution to this that in the first instance is Afghan-owned and Afghan-led but ultimately can lead to a diminution of the violence, a ceasefire, and a durable political outcome going forward.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> One more: What role do you see for India after U.S. withdraws all its troops from Afghanistan? India has been a major donor for Afghanistan’s developmental activities; now it’s – closing down most of those development activities now.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, this goes to what I was saying before, and we have seen a role for India and other countries in the region, knowing that it is a shared and collective interest on the part of Afghanistan’s neighbors and countries further afield for there to be a stable and secure Afghanistan. All countries in the region have a significant stake in that, including India, and we do appreciate India’s strong record of offering development assistance to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>But this has been a primary chore of ours to encourage Afghanistan’s neighbors to continue to do all they can to support the people of Afghanistan and, on a political level, to lend their support and to lend their collective national voices to the ongoing political process and the diplomacy that is taking place in Qatar, that is taking place between the Afghan parties, knowing that in our estimation, in the estimation of much of the international community, that is the only viable and realistic path forward to achieve what we all collectively seek to see fulfilled.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-RUSSIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you very much. Voice of America Russian service. I have two questions; I will ask them one by one. Today, Russian investigative committee pressed new charges against Russian opposition politician Aleksey Navalny, and he is already in jail. And earlier this year, concern about Navalny’s destiny was expressed at the highest level of the United States by the President. So are you aware of this development? And should we expect some reaction from State Department?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We are aware of this development. Of course, this follows on the heels of the Russian Government’s – not only its arrest and detention of Mr. Navalny but the violent crackdown on the many Russians who peacefully took to the streets to demonstrate against his detention. It follows on the heels of efforts to intimidate and to suppress those organizations, NGOs, independent organizations that are allied with Mr. Navalny. So in many ways, this is just a continuation of a very disturbing pattern. The United States continues to stand on the side and stand with the many Russians who we saw not all that long ago, again, peacefully take to the streets to hold their government to account, to express their aspirations for greater freedoms, to protest the repression and the level of repression that – to which they have been subject. So yes, we’re watching very closely.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And another question: There are some media reports that 27 members of U.S. Congress recently written letter to Secretary Blinken demanding, I quote, “suspension of any export permits for U.S. drone technology to Turkey.” Did you receive this letter, and could you say if department is going to take actions regarding this letter? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>I’ll see if we can get you more information on that.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-AFGHANISTAN2"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And can we get back to Afghanistan really quick, Ned?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Sure. Back in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks. Just really quickly, the behavior by the Taliban that you have described today and have been describing, does the United States see any of that as sanctionable?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>We – as I said yesterday, just as we are investing in a diplomatic process because we are cognizant that only through diplomacy can we achieve the sort of just and durable outcome that we seek to achieve, we will not hesitate to use the carrots and the sticks that are available to us. If we see behavior that would warrant and that would be appropriate for that kind of tool, it is certainly not off the table.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And also a Taliban spokesperson told Axios regarding a question about whether they were concerned about becoming an international pariah that “e have never yielded to any foreign pressure tactics before and we don’t plan to capitulate any time soon either.” The Taliban is blatantly saying that is has no interest nor does it have any interest in being pressured by the international community, so what makes the administration so confident that it can pressure using the international community?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>Well, look, I’m not going to engage in a tit for tat with a Taliban spokesperson. I will tell you – and Ambassador Khalilzad has made this point as well – that in discussions with the Taliban, they have been candid and they have said publicly that they did not in the 1990s recognize the importance of international legitimacy, that they did not recognize the advantages it would – that would come with it.</p>
<p>More practically, this is – international legitimacy, of course, it’s a virtue, it’s a good thing, but there are some practical realities that come along with it. And so beyond international approval or condemnation, legitimacy bestows and essentially is the ticket to the levels of international assistance, humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people, international funding and assistance for any future government in Afghanistan. That would be required for any future government, again, to have any semblance of durability. There are other practical implications. They want sanctions lifted, they want the ability to travel, to engage in international diplomacy. None of that would be possible were they to continue down this path, were they to attempt to take the country by force, were they not to respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Afghan people – not only the fundamental rights and freedoms, but going back to Matt’s first question, the hard-won gains of the past 20 years, those gains that the United States was integral to helping the Afghan people secure.</p>
<p>So it is a – it is about much more than legitimacy. It’s about what legitimacy can lead to both for – in terms of support and on the other side of the ledger.</p>
<p>Lara.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So a follow-up on that: Given that any U.S. assistance to the Afghan Government, whether it includes the Taliban in the future or not, would be funneled through the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, have there been any discussions by Ambassador Khalilzad or others in the State Department with the Taliban to assure the security of the U.S. embassy in the future?</p>
<p>And also to follow up on my colleague’s very good question about other diplomatic missions from other countries pulling out of Afghanistan right now, is the United States engaged with discussions with any of those missions to try to persuade them to stay?</p>
<p><strong>MR. PRICE: </strong>So this is a challenge that we have treated as a collective challenge since not only this administration, but it really goes back to the earliest days of America’s engagement in Afghanistan in 2001. More recently, with the diplomacy, again, we have brought together a broad swath of countries in various formats and forms. The – I can just give you a sampling of some of the countries that have been a part of various elements of this process. I’ve mentioned Russia, China, Pakistan, the EU, France, Germany, Italy, NATO, Norway, the UK, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, NATO, of course, Spain, Sweden, India, Qatar, of course, Turkey, Indonesia – the list goes on. These are countries who have lent their voices, who have lent their – engaged diplomatically in this process. We have, the United States has, on a bilateral and a multilateral basis, discussed our objectives with many of these countries. We have with many, if not most of them, interests that are quite well aligned.</p>
<p>Look, the presence and staffing of any given country in Afghanistan is going to be a sovereign decision. The United States, we have and will continue to make our own decisions based on, first and foremost, the threat assessment, the safety and security of our people. Other countries will be doing the same. We&#8217;ve talked about this in the context of Hamid Karzai International Airport, in the imperative of a functioning and operable international airport, to sustaining the operations at our embassy. It&#8217;s also important to other embassies on the ground. But ultimately, it&#8217;s going to be a question for individual countries as to what they&#8217;re comfortable with, consistent with their interests and their goals. Fortunately, we do share not only goals and interests, but also values with many of these countries as they apply to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Remind me of your first question. Your &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Has Ambassador Khalilzad or anybody else in the State Department discussed the security and the future of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul with the Taliban?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So, of course, the U.S.-Taliban agreement – the Taliban did make commitments when it comes to U.S. forces and coalition forces on the ground. We are taking a number of steps – those include with physical security, that includes with diplomacy – to do everything we can to ensure the safety, security, welfare, and well-being of our diplomats and U.S. Government presence on the ground. But I&#8217;m not in position to detail that further.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. Just to clarify one thing: That long list of countries that you read off, you&#8217;re not saying that they have all committed to keeping their diplomatic missions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No. No, no, no. These are countries that in one form or fashion have made the point that any government that seeks to take Afghanistan by force will lack international legitimacy.</p>
<p>Yes, Simon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yes, staying on Afghanistan, the Taliban issued a statement denying the killing of innocent civilians and driving people from their homes. That&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ve cited evidence saying that that&#8217;s happening. I wonder if that – is it – does the U.S. have its own evidence for that? And Taliban are saying they would be willing to be part of a – to form a team with the UN and the ICRC to conduct some kind of independent investigation. Is that something that you would support? Is that something that&#8217;s been discussed in Doha or – and if it did happen, could it be impartial if it includes members of the Taliban?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I am not aware of any ongoing discussions for a joint investigation the likes of which you described, and that&#8217;s for a very simple reason: There is, everywhere you look, compelling data points, evidence, imagery, of the violence, the bloodshed, the potential atrocities that the Taliban are committing. The embassy has been very clear about this. We have – can see it with our own eyes from some of the footage that&#8217;s emerging. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why we are doing everything we can to accelerate the efforts of the international community to speak with one voice, to condemn what&#8217;s going, and beyond that, to seek a diminution of the violence, a ceasefire, and a political settlement among the parties.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>And just to follow up, the – Al Jazeera is reporting that the head of the Afghan Reconciliation Committee is saying the Taliban was not showing seriousness in the peace talks and it&#8217;s clear that they don&#8217;t believe in a political solution. Obviously, you&#8217;ve talked about this, but I wonder if you – people who are involved in these talks don&#8217;t have any faith in the Taliban’s seriousness, so.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s accurate to say the Afghan Government doesn&#8217;t have any faith. The fact that Abdullah Abdullah is there in Qatar, that they are taking – that they have sent a high-level representative this week, I think speaks to the recognition that yes, this process has been too slow, yes, we would like to see these talks achieve meaningful progress. We would have liked to have seen that weeks ago. But despite all the challenges, despite what we’re seeing, that, again, diplomacy is the only means through which we can achieve a diminution of the violence, a ceasefire, and ultimately a just and durable political solution.</p>
<p>The other point that is relevant is that throughout history – and I made this point yesterday – it is not the case that peace talks require peace on the ground. Very rarely have you looked at instances of peace negotiations only to find peace on the ground. So with the levels of violence, we are doing everything we can to encourage the international community to step up, and doing everything we can to support meaningful progress towards diminishing the violence and setting this process back on the path towards a ceasefire and a durable solution. Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-POLAND"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Marcin Wrona, TVN Discovery from Poland. Today the ruling party in Poland is pushing hard in the parliament to pass a law forcing Discovery, an American company and the owner of our network, which is the largest American investment in Poland, out of the country. So in fact the goal is to silence the largest independent TV network in Poland. Do you have a comment on this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I do. Well, first, let me just say thank you for being here. Certainly this law – if this law were to go into force, it would have a very personal impact on you and your colleagues, and we appreciate that and we understand that. And it is part and parcel of the reason why we’ve been so vocal on this.</p>
<p>There are actually two pieces of legislation that are before the Polish parliament. One is the media law you referenced. The other is the Holocaust restitution legislation. We are watching these legislative efforts in Poland on media and Holocaust restitution very closely. Poland is an important NATO Ally that understands, importantly, that the transatlantic alliance is based not only on mutual interests when it comes to our shared security, but also mutual commitments to shared democratic values and prosperity.</p>
<p>When it comes to the media law, we know that a free and independent media – they make our democracies stronger. It makes the transatlantic alliance more resilient, including to those who would seek to divide the alliance and divide us, and it is a fundamental component of our bilateral relationship with Poland. And so that is why we have urged Poland to – the Government of Poland to demonstrate its commitments to these principles, which are indeed shared, not only in words but in deed. And the government now has that opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Let me follow up quickly. Counselor Derek Chollet was in Poland and he talked with the Polish authorities. A bipartisan group from the Senate and also a bipartisan group from the House of Representatives sent letters to the authorities in Poland, and all of that to no effect. So how do you intend to talk with Warsaw? How do you intend to engage with the authorities in Poland?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we have engaged with authorities in Warsaw at very high levels. You did mention Counselor Chollet was there in person. I can tell you that some of the most senior people in this building, including in recent hours, have had discussions with senior Polish officials on these very subjects.</p>
<p>Look, both of these bills are before the Polish parliament. The Government of Poland now has an opportunity to show that both in – to show in deed and not only in word that it stands by the values that unite our transatlantic alliance and the values that bind the United States and Poland. So we’ll be watching very closely.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Did you want to say something about the restitution law &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So on the restitution law – this is the other piece of legislation that we are watching very closely and quite concerned with, and we’re concerned by any steps that would impede the ability of Holocaust survivors and their families, as well as other Jewish and non-Jewish property owners, to attain restitution or compensation for property wrongfully confiscated during Poland’s communist era. So we’re also watching that very closely.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. And then you also said that there have been – today, within the last couple hours? Can you be a little bit more specific about who was in touch with the Poles about this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I wouldn’t want to offer any additional detail, but very high levels.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> All right. Okay. Well, as – oh, very high levels? Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Do you mean the offer that was delayed in Pakistan?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> It was delayed, so do you have any response to the fact that it’s not – that the opposition managed to delay consideration of this until next month?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have a specific comment on that, but we’ll be watching very, very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just a follow-up.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let me move over just to anyone who hasn’t gotten a question. Shaun.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-BELARUS"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just do – stay in the region, on Belarus.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Belarusian – the Lukashenka regime, ordering the United States to reduce its diplomatic presence. Do you have any reaction to that? And in light of the U.S. – Ambassador Fisher’s status, how would the U.S. actually be affected by this order?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sure. Well, as you alluded to, authorities in Minsk today – and this was relayed via the Belarusian ministry of foreign affairs – informed the United States that it is imposing new limits on American diplomatic and technical personnel at our embassy in Minsk effective next month, September 1. The regime has also recalled its agreement to receive Julie Fisher as U.S. ambassador to Belarus. It is important to remember in all of this and to acknowledge that Belarusian authorities are responsible for the deterioration in U.S.-Belarus relations through relentless repression against their citizens. And that includes through the intensifying crackdowns that we have seen targeting members of civil society, targeting media, targeting athletes, students, legal professionals, and other citizens.</p>
<p>And that’s why in response to these events, the White House and the broader administration announced just this week on August 9th the strongest set of sanctions on the Lukashenko regime to date. What we know is that a sovereign, independent Belarus that respects the democratic will of its citizens, their human rights, and the country’s international obligations, that is in not only the interests of the Belarusian people, but also the United States. We are disappointed to be where we are now in terms of our relationship with Belarus, but we’ll continue to work with our allies and partners to promote shared interests.</p>
<p>When it comes to Ambassador Fisher and your question, the United States Government, Ambassador Fisher, personnel at our embassy in Minsk, they will continue to support the democratic aspirations of the people of Belarus. U.S. diplomats will continue to engage with Belarusians, including leaders of the pro-democracy movement, media professionals, students, and other elements of civil society, wherever they are.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-SUDAN"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>In the interest of time, let me just go to something else, to Sudan. The transitional government say that they’re willing to hand over Omar al-Bashir to the ICC. That, of course, has long been a goal the of United States. Do you have any reaction to this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Has there been any U.S. discussions with them on this?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, we do welcome the reconfirmation by the council of ministers, or the cabinet, of its intention to hand over former President Bashir and other former officials wanted by the ICC for crimes in Darfur. We look forward to joint action by the cabinet and the sovereign council to finalize and execute this decision. We urge Sudan to continue to cooperate with the ICC by handing over those subject to arrest warrants and by cooperating on the provision of the requested evidence. Doing so would be a major step for Sudan in the fight against decades of impunity.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-BELARUS2"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I have just a quick follow-up on Shaun’s Belarus question. I believe the Minsk authorities wanted to reduce the U.S. embassy presence to five. Do you know what it is currently? How much of a decrease of that and how much of a problem would that be for the embassy there?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I don’t have our current staffing figures for the embassy in Minsk, but Belarusian authorities have indicated that they will be reducing the size of their mission to the United States to five diplomats, and have requested that we limit the size of our embassy in Minsk to five American diplomats by the deadline of September 1st.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-AFGHANISTAN3"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Just going back to Rich’s question about sanctions on the Taliban, sort of related to it, yesterday you mentioned that the U.S. was not taking any tools off the table with regard to what it could impose on the Taliban and would use those tools if the State Department deemed them appropriate. It seems like now would be an appropriate time to use any tools the U.S. has at its disposal. So could you maybe go into more detail about what tools you’re referring to and when would be appropriate to use those tools?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, there are any number of forms of leverage that the – our partners in this effort have. I’ve mentioned, both today and yesterday, the leverage that the Government of Afghanistan has in the form – in many ways, but of course, importantly, in the form of its armed forces – 300,000 trained soldiers, an air force, heavy equipment, continuing support from the United States. There are other countries in the region that can exert influence and leverage over the Taliban.</p>
<p>We are – this is part of why we are continuing to galvanize international attention, international support to the diplomacy. We have, the United States has important sources of leverage too. That includes both carrots and sticks. I don’t think it’s prudent for us to preview what we might do, but the fact is that we will not hesitate – if we think it will be in the interests of the people of Afghanistan, if we think it is an appropriate recourse – to use any and all tools at our disposal. The one tool we have taken off the table, of course, is the reintroduction of U.S. service members, because this President, in the priority he attaches that he attaches to the safety, security of American citizens, including of course our service members. We have concluded that the United States will no longer use our service members as sources of leverage in a negotiation, something that had not borne fruit previously. Beyond that, though, we have any number of sources of leverage and we’ll be prepared to use them if it’s appropriate.</p>
<p>Yes. Let me go right over here.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-SUMMITFORDEMOCRACY2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. I’d like to go to the topic of summit of the democracies in December. Has the administration finalized the invitees? How would you draw a line between who is democracy that is qualified to be invited and who isn’t? Because we know that some countries claim they are democracies when they are not in other standards. For example, China claims that it has its own brand of democracy with, quote, “Chinese characteristics,” unquote.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> What I can say is that we have reached out to a regionally diverse set of both well-established as well as emerging democracies whose progress and commitments will advance a more just and peaceful world.</p>
<p>Our goal in all of this in putting together the virtual summit for later this year is to be as inclusive as possible, and of course we have to do so within logistical constraints. But we are, therefore, considering additional opportunities to ensure that even beyond this virtual gathering, all relevant voices and viewpoints can feed into the summit process. And we’ll continue working with summit participants and other governments around the world to – and let me just say, those other participants include nongovernmental participants, nongovernmental stakeholders, civil society, and other actors to address democratic backsliding, promote respect for human rights, defend against corruption both at home and abroad, whether that work occurs within or outside of the summit framework.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So having the private sector involved, would you be strengthening, like, technology security and supply chain issues and all of those topics? Could you give us some more color to what the summit would look like?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we’ll have much more on this in the coming weeks. But let me just say that this summit, as we see it, is an opportunity to engage, listen, and speak honestly about the challenges that democracies face. It’s an opportunity to work together with likeminded governments, civil society, and the private sector on meaningful new commitments and new initiatives and to cooperatively build a foundation for democratic renewal globally.</p>
<p>This is not just a forum for sharing thoughts. This is a forum for putting forward concrete ideas, concrete commitments. That is part of what we have solicited in our initial outreach to countries around the world, asking them to be bold, to be ambitious in terms of what they might be able to bring forward, and we look forward to having that discussion with participants in the coming weeks and several months.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-NORTHKOREA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can I just have one more question on North Korea?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. North Korea has issued a warning to U.S. and South Korea again. It said the U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise risks provoking, quote, “a serious security crisis.” With consecutive statements coming from the DPRK’s senior officials, does the U.S. see this North Korea action as escalating tension?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong> Look, I don’t want to – I wouldn’t want to offer an assessment as to what may or may not be the message from the DPRK. What I will do is reiterate our message, and it’s a very simple one. The joint military exercises, they are purely defensive in nature. We have long maintained the United States harbors no hostile intent towards the DPRK. We remain – it is true we remain committed to the security of the Republic of Korea and our defined – combined defense posture in accordance with the ironclad alliance we have with the ROK.</p>
<p>We support intra-Korean dialogue, we support intra-Korean engagement, and will continue to work with our ROK partners to that end.</p>
<p>A couple final questions, Andrea and Simon.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-AFGHANISTAN4"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You talked about using all leverage with the Taliban. Are you prepared to use leverage against American banks who, according to a lawsuit filed by Gold Star families, including the family of Anne Smedinghoff, a revered and decorated Foreign Service officer who lost her life in 2013 in Afghanistan, to go after banks that are headquartered here that are allegedly money-laundering and getting money to the Taliban?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Our efforts when it comes to illicit finance, we have many tools at our disposal. Again, I think it is far too tactical for me to entertain a question like that from here at this point. But the point remains we are and will be prepared to use any tool that in our estimation can provide – would provide an advantage to what we seek to do. And ultimately, that is to bring about stability, security to the people of Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Could you take a question on that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We’ll see if we can provide anything, but I just don’t think we’re going to be in a position to offer anything specific.</p>
<p>Simon.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-BURMA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You had at the top some comments about Austin Tice. There’s another American who’s detained overseas, Danny Fenster in Myanmar. I saw – I wanted to bring to your attention his brother, Bryan Fenster, on Twitter he acted – he tagged you in his tweet but I don’t think you responded, but he’s asking for – there’s a – the fact that there’s an American journalist still wrongly imprisoned 80 days later in Myanmar. What is the Biden administration doing to bring Danny Fenster home?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, this is a priority for us. It’s a priority for us for a couple of reasons. As we’ve said about Austin Tice, the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens is – it’s a highest priority of the U.S. Government, and we remain deeply concerned over the continued detention of Danny Fenster, who was working as a journalist in Burma. We are closely monitoring his situation. We continue to press Burma’s military regime to release Danny immediately. We will do so until he is able to return home safely to his family. Danny is a journalist, as I said. We’ll also continue to make the point that journalism is not a crime. A free and independent media, it’s indispensable to building prosperous, resilient, free societies. The continued detention of Danny, the arrests of other journalists, the use, the employment of the Burmese military against members of the media – that constitutes an unacceptable attack on freedom of expression in Burma. Consular officers have spoken with Danny several times by phone. Members of his family have also been on those calls. And we’ll continue to urge Burmese authorities to effect his immediate release. That continues to be our goal.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is that contact with consular officials ongoing? Because there was a protest in the Insein Prison and I think they lost contact for a while. At the moment, they’re in regular contact?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It has been – it has been several weeks, I understand, since we’ve been able to be in contact. But consular officers, the embassy in Burma is following this case very closely.</p>
<p><a id="post-269487-UKDEPARTMENT2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, if it’s the case that journalism is not a crime, then why do you have a problem saying that what you believe – that you do not believe that Julian Assange is a journalist? Or – or you do believe that he’s a journalist and you just don’t care?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> No, it’s actually a procedural issue. The fact that he &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So journalism is not a crime, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Journalism is not a crime, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, but not in the case of Julian Assange? Or you don’t believe he’s a journalist? If you – it’s a really – it’s a binary choice.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> It’s really easy, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The Department of Justice is handling this matter, okay?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Journalism is not a crime.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We have made that very clear.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But unless it’s Julian Assange. Or you don’t believe that he’s a journalist.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, you can talk to the Department of Justice. They have put forward &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I sit here every day.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; public charging documents and other documents. I would refer you to those. When you ask about pending cases, whether the case is an extradition of Julian Assange or anyone else &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> He just asked about a pending case in Burma, and you were &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Not an extradition case, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, no, but I mean you – but &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> No, but it is – it’s very simple. Matt, it’s &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Danny Fenster has been &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It’s very simple, and I’m surprised you’re having trouble understanding. We don’t speak to extradition cases.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m asking you not about an extradition case.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> You are asking &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m asking you whether you believe Julian Assange is a journalist or not.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> You are asking me about &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How is that &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> You are &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How does that have anything to do with extradition? Do you believe that what he was doing is journalism or not?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Thank you all very much.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 3:14 p.m.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p class="p1">We stand with the international community in calling for the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to release, immediately and unconditionally, Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig. We continue to condemn these arbitrary detentions as well as the sentence imposed against Mr. Spavor on August 10. Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig have not received the minimal procedural protections during their more than two-and-a-half-year arbitrary detention, and we stand with more than 60 countries who endorsed the recent Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention in State-to-State Relations. In my discussions with PRC officials, I have raised several cases of both U.S. and Canadian citizens subject to arbitrary detentions and exit bans in China, and I strongly support the immediate and unconditional release of all those whom the People’s Republic of China has arbitrarily detained. The practice of arbitrarily detaining individuals to exercise leverage over foreign governments is completely unacceptable. People should never be used as bargaining chips.</p>
<p class="p1">The United States also remains deeply troubled by the lack of transparency surrounding these legal proceedings and joins Canada in calling for full consular access to Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the China-Canada Consular Agreement. We call upon PRC authorities to grant the requests of Canadian officials and other foreign diplomats to attend their proceedings.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:13 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon. Happy Tuesday. A couple items at the top and then we’ll turn right to your questions.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-BURMA"></a> First, I want to call your attention and reiterate what U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in her written statement related to recent arrests made in the alleged plot targeting Burma’s permanent representative to the United Nations.</p>
<p>We are grateful, as she said, that law enforcement moved swiftly to respond to the horrific alleged plot to seriously injure or kill Burma’s permanent representative to the UN. The United States stands in solidarity with Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, who continues to demonstrate remarkable courage and bravery in speaking on behalf of the people of Burma who demand a return to democracy.</p>
<p>We are grateful this alleged plot, which was to have taken place on U.S. soil, was thwarted and that the suspected perpetrators were arrested and are now facing justice.</p>
<p>We unequivocally condemn this threat to Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, which fits a disturbing pattern of authoritarian leaders and their supporters reaching across the globe – including even into the United States – to persecute and repress journalists, activists, and others who dare speak or stand against them.</p>
<p>These acts of transnational repression must be met with the condemnation of the world and with full and certain accountability.</p>
<p>We will not stand for efforts by authoritarian regimes and their supporters and enablers to repress people on our soil or across borders, and we will continue to coordinate with allies and partners to stand against transnational repression everywhere.</p>
<p>And today, during her official visit to Thailand, U.S. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield announced more than $50 million in critical humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma, including for those forced to flee violence and persecution in the wake of the military coup.</p>
<p>This aid, provided by the State Department and USAID, will enable our international and NGO partners to provide emergency food assistance, life-saving protection, shelter, essential health care, water, sanitation, and hygiene services to the people of Burma.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-COVID"></a> In addition, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield announced $5 million in aid to help Thailand fight COVID-19.</p>
<p>This funding comes at a critical point of rising humanitarian needs, and will help mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on the lives of people of both Thailand and Burma.</p>
<p>We continue to urge other donors to generously support the urgent humanitarian needs of the people of Burma and to support the global efforts to combat COVID-19.</p>
<p>With that, I am happy to turn to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks. Sorry, I was late. I was on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Just in time.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-DEPARTMENT"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Just in time. I have a – one housekeeping item that I want to start with and then go to Afghanistan. It&#8217;s now been a little bit over two weeks – 15 days, I think – since the swastika was discovered in the elevator. Secretary came out, obviously condemned it, said there would be an investigation into it. What&#8217;s the result of the investigation?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, Matt, as you know, shortly after the swastika was discovered, the Secretary sent a note to the entire workforce. And he made clear in that note that hate has no home here. And nowhere is that tolerated, everywhere is it abhorrent, but here in this department, the – a department that stands for defending human rights, human dignity, the values of pluralism and inclusion around the world, that symbol is especially repugnant, and repugnant to the women and men of the department and to everyone who works here.</p>
<p>In the days after – and you heard directly from Secretary Blinken, I guess it was a week ago yesterday, on this – of course, President Biden has put forward a nominee for a special envoy to combat anti-Semitism, put forward a nominee for – to be an envoy for international religious freedom. And as Secretary Blinken noted in his message to the workforce, there is an investigation underway. I know this is a priority on the part of the investigators who are looking closely into this. I don&#8217;t have an update that I&#8217;m able to provide at the time, but if and when we do, I will certainly be able give you that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, far be it from me to say that something is taking a long time or not taking a long time, because I – but an elevator is a pretty small place, right? This building has got controlled access. It would seem to me that two weeks is more than enough to come up with a – to come up with some kind of explanation. And while you&#8217;re correct in saying that this kind of hate has no place and that the Secretary said that, this building also stands for accountability and transparency. So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Absolutely. Absolutely. And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So are you really telling me that two weeks after the fact, they can&#8217;t – they got no leads &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>The elevator is a small place. This building, as you know, is a large place.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah, but it’s not that big, Ned. Come on. It’s not that big. All right. If you don&#8217;t have anything, you don&#8217;t have anything.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I don’t have anything to offer now, but we &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>All right, let’s go on &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>&#8212; of course, do believe in the value of transparency. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re out here every day.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>And, of course, as soon as we have an update, we&#8217;ll be able to share that.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-AFGHANISTAN"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. Okay. On Afghanistan, I just want to make – get – does this administration believe that the Taliban is upholding its end of the deal that was signed in February 2020, the end of February 2020, in Doha?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So let me take a step back and offer some broader context, and I will come to that. I take it you&#8217;re coming at this question in light of the escalating violence and Taliban aggression.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, no, no. No reason at all.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay, okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, no. (Laughter.) It just occurred to me out of thin air.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So let me first comment on that and then we’ll come to it. The – what we are seeing – what we have seen in recent days and recent weeks – the violence, the loss of life, the aggression – it is of grave concern. It is of grave concern to this department. It is of grave concern to the entire United States Government. What we are doing around the clock is seeking to find a way out of this, and here in this department, in the Department of State, we are focused on the diplomacy that can eventually see a just and durable solution to this conflict.</p>
<p>And as part of that – the latest example of that diplomacy, as we announced last night – Ambassador Khalilzad is currently in Doha. He is there to advance a collective international response to what can only be termed as a rapidly deteriorating security situation. He will and has already taken part in several rounds of planned meetings in the coming days. Those meetings, including one today, have and will include representatives from the region as well as beyond and from multilateral organizations to press for a reduction in this violence and a ceasefire and commitment by the part of these regional and broader governments and multilateral and international institutions not to recognize any government that is imposed by force.</p>
<p>And this is something that – you’ve heard me say this recently, but it is not just our contention that any government that comes to power in Afghanistan at the barrel of a gun will lack international support and international legitimacy. It is, in fact, the consensus that has emerged and that has been stated any number of times. Just last week, the UN Security Council put out a statement, the final line of which said, “The members of the Security Council recall Resolution 2513, reaffirm that there is no military solution to the conflict, and declare that they do not support the restoration of the Islamic Emirate.” I went through last week a litany of countries, of international blocs and institutions that have signed on to this, this simple proposition that any government that comes to force in Afghanistan will lack legitimacy and, more practically, won’t have that international assistance that any government would almost certainly need to achieve any degree of durability.</p>
<p>So that is what Ambassador Khalilzad is there to seek to advance and seek to support. He will press the Taliban to stop their military offensive and to negotiate a political settlement. We, again, know that is the only path to stability, to development in Afghanistan. We also know the opposite is true, that if this violence continues, if the Taliban continues down this path, we are likely to see a prolonged, protracted period of violence, of instability. And that is not in anyone’s interest – certainly not in the interests of the people of Afghanistan and not in the interests of what the Taliban seek.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, I – yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Now, coming back to your original question, the U.S.-Taliban agreement – the application of it has been uneven. We have always – we have consistently said violence in Afghanistan – and this is perhaps clearer than it’s ever been – levels of violence are unacceptably high. That is true.</p>
<p>What is also true is that the Taliban has adhered to an important part of the U.S.-Taliban agreement.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But have they adhered to the whole thing?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What we’ve consistently said is that levels of violence are unacceptably high. But &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, if they haven’t adhered to the whole thing, do you have any recourse? Well, first of all, do you think that they are following their commitments, or are they in violation of that agreement? What’s happening right now on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The levels of violence are unacceptably high. What’s happening on the ground &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But that – that means nothing. Is that a violation?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; is unacceptable and is – it is not in the spirit &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Does that violate the deal that Zal negotiated? You’ve got him back there now, and if the Taliban are in violation of the agreement that they signed with him in – and Secretary Pompeo in February 2020, then why would you ever believe that they are – that anything that he could do there now would make any difference on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> There &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But the – the main question is: Are they violating the February 2020 agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Certainly the levels of violence do not appear consistent with what the Taliban pledged in that agreement. Let me make another point, though: There is another important element to that deal that is important for two reasons, and that, of course, is the proviso that they not target U.S. or coalition forces. The Taliban had not done so. That part of the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So they’re adhering to that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That part of the agreement &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So are they in violation of any other part of the agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> But let me &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> It’s a very easy question, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let me get to why that’s important. That’s important for a couple reasons.</p>
<p>One, it suggests because the same people on the Taliban side and the same people on our side who negotiated that 2020 agreement are – have been engaged in dialogue, engaged in discussion. And so the fact that an important element of the U.S.-Taliban agreement has been upheld suggests that, contrary to some speculation, what happens in Doha does have an impact on the ground in Afghanistan. It does suggest that there is room for diplomatic progress to be made. And that is what we are seeking to do. We are going to exhaust every diplomatic avenue, because we know the stakes if we fail to do that. The Afghan people know the stakes if there is not a negotiated agreement and a ceasefire that is put in place.</p>
<p>But there’s another reason that element of the U.S.-Taliban agreement is noteworthy, and this gets back to the decision that you heard directly from President Biden. The idea that the United States could have maintained a significant military presence in Afghanistan and that we would have found and encountered conditions that were just as we would have found them on April 30th of this year going into May 1 or May 2nd – that was just not tenable. It was not in the cards, and it was not in the cards because, according to that agreement that was negotiated by the United States – not this administration, but the previous one – if our forces remain there in great numbers after May 1, they could again have become targets of violence.</p>
<p>This President places great priority – the greatest priority – on the safety, the security, the well-being of our service members. So the idea that a force of a couple thousand U.S. military service members either would have been able to remain in Afghanistan with the status quo, or frankly that a force of that size would have been able to stand in the way of what we are seeing now – both of those propositions are hollow, and they’re hollow for the very simple reason that &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> They’re also unprovable. And I’ll stop, so – other people have questions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Follow-up, or joint &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Follow-up on Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> An EU official has said the Taliban now controls 65 percent of Afghanistan. Given its rapid takeover, is there any hesitancy or second thoughts with the U.S. thinking over Turkey’s effort to run the Kabul airport?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Taking – Turkey’s efforts to run the Kabul effort – airport?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The – what that gets to, what the Kabul airport represents, is something more than – you might say most airports – it’s more about – it’s more than air travel; it’s more than commercial travel, certainly. A secure, operational airport we feel is integral to our ability to have a functioning diplomatic presence on the ground. So the safety, the security, the continuing operation of that airport – it is of high importance to us. We are grateful that our Turkish partners have indicated a willingness to play a role in protecting that. Of course, Afghan Security Forces have an important role to play, too. But nothing that we have seen diminishes the importance we place on a functioning, safe, secure Hamid Karzai International Airport.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Have you picked up any hesitancy from the Turks on this issue?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> This is an issue that we have discussed, including at the highest levels, with our Turkish allies. President Biden, of course, discussed it with his counterpart, with President Erdogan. The department has discussed it in multiple levels. It is now principally a discussion that the Department of Defense is leading. As we always do, we keep those discussions in confidence, but we do appreciate Turkey’s willingness to take on an important role.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Following up &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; thank you – following up on the U.S.-Taliban agreement. Isn’t – to be more specific and try to get an answer – isn’t the Taliban violating the commitment not to attack cities and towns that was in the annexes of that agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That gets back to what we have consistently said. Levels of violence are too high. They are unacceptably high. That is why we are focused on diminishing the level of violence. We are doing this diplomatically; the State Department certainly is. But of course, the Afghans have a role to play, an important role to play – perhaps a more important role than they have had to play over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>And the other point is that yes, the Taliban have made gains; yes, the Taliban has inflicted horrific violence on their country, killing their fellow countrymen and women in the process, seemingly indiscriminately. At the same time – we’ve made this point before, but – the Afghan Government, the Afghan National Security Forces, far outnumber the Taliban – 300,000 – a capable fighting force of 300,000 troops, an air force that has modern weaponry, that has been trained by the United States, that just recently was provided with additional equipment. They have special forces. They have heavy equipment. So they have a capable fighting force.</p>
<p>For our part, we continue to support Afghan Security Forces. We’re committed to supporting those forces well into the future. You just look at what President Biden has requested in his budget request – $3.3 billion for the support of the Afghan Security Forces. That is a clear indication of our continuing support well into the future for these Afghan National Security Forces.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Was the withdrawal of the U.S. forces a condition-based withdrawal, and if yes, would you say that the Taliban are respecting their conditions of the withdrawal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Was our withdrawal conditions-based?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> No. Our withdrawal is not conditions-based, for the simple reason that it was preordained that a conditions-based withdrawal was essentially taken off the table. This administration could not – this President &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So why make a deal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So why make a deal if there was no conditions to the withdrawal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The deal closed the door on a conditions-based withdrawal. It’s a very important point. The U.S.-Taliban agreement stipulates a number of things. Among those things that it stipulates is that on May 1st of this year the United States was to withdraw its military forces. This was an agreement that was concluded in early 2020, a year before this administration came in. It was an agreement that – as President Biden said when he announced the military withdrawal, it’s a deal that this administration probably would not have made, certainly not in all the detail. But it’s a deal that we inherited.</p>
<p>And so that gets back to the point that it was never an option for the United States to maintain its forces. Or I should say it was never a viable option for this President, a president who prioritizes the safety, the security, the well-being of our service members, to maintain forces there in significant numbers after May 1, knowing that the status quo would not stand after May 1. From April 30th to May 1st, our service members would have become – could have become, once again – targets of violence. And that is something that had not happened since the U.S.-Taliban agreement. That was not a proposition this President, this administration, was willing to accept.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one last on Afghanistan for me. You’ve been issuing the same warnings to the Taliban for the last several days and weeks. They haven’t heard any of it. What makes you think that they will change their course now that they’re gaining and gaining cities and capitals?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Look, we have been very clear where we stand, but also where the international community stands. You’re seeing this reflected right now in Qatar, where the Qataris are hosting a series of meetings involving much of the region, much of the international community, to discuss and to ultimately advance this diplomatic project.</p>
<p>I think there’s also a misconception that in order for negotiations, peace negotiations, to take place there is the requirement that there be peace on the ground. In fact, if you look back through history, very rarely have peace negotiations taken place when peace is present on the ground. What we’re seeing is levels of violence that are of grave concern. They’re certainly not within the spirt of the U.S.-Taliban agreement. But we know that diplomacy is the only way that we are ever going to achieve a durable solution and, insofar as we are concerned, a just solution.</p>
<p>And so we have made very clear that in order for us and for our allies and partners to be able to recognize any future government of Afghanistan and to provide assistance to it, it must emerge from a political settlement that meets five criteria. First, it must be inclusive; second, it must respect the rights of all Afghans, including women and minorities; third, it allows the Afghan people to have a say in choosing their leaders; fourth, it must prevent Afghan soil from being used to threaten the United States and its allies and partners; and fifth and finally, it must respect its commitments in terms of international law and international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>We’ve made these criteria very clear to the Taliban. President Ghani, Chairman Abdullah have accepted these criteria for their part. We have discussed these criteria with our allies and partners. And for us, this will be the roadmap for recognition and for assistance to any future government of Afghanistan. It’s not – again, not just us. It is the countries in the region and well beyond that espouse this.</p>
<p>Nick.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, just a quick follow-up. So is there any circumstance under which the administration would consider stopping or reversing the troop withdrawal? Is there anything that the Taliban could do that would force this administration to do that, or are troops coming out no matter what?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, this gets back to I think what we were talking about before, but let me just say: Every commander in chief faces difficult choices. That’s really the nature of the role of commander in chief. If something reaches the desk of the president of the United States, any number of hundreds or thousands of people have probably mulled it over before with some degree of lack of consensus or consternation. President Biden made a very tough decision. He was clear that after 20 years of conflict, after our service members had accomplished the task that had been asked of them initially – the decimation of the network responsible for the 9/11 attacks, bringing Osama bin Laden to justice over 10 years ago – it was time for our troops to come home.</p>
<p>But the other relevant piece of this is that it gets back to what was in some ways preordained. The status quo was not an option. If we had announced a plan to extend our military presence or sustain it indefinitely, there was a risk, a not insignificant risk, that our service members would once again become the attempted targets of Taliban attacks and Taliban offensives.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>But so in – I mean, in other words, what you seem to be saying is that it&#8217;s okay if the Taliban don&#8217;t abide by their part of the deal because you&#8217;re acknowledging that there&#8217;s – the levels of violence are too high, but then at the same time, you&#8217;re saying listen, we had to abide by our promises under this deal, even if the Taliban did not abide by their promises.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, what we&#8217;re saying is that President Biden decided very firmly that our military service members would not be bargaining chips, that their lives would not be used as leverage for what we would all hope and seek to achieve in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So are you then – I mean, okay – I mean, the U.S. maintains troop presences in countries all over the world indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I would caution against comparing what U.S. forces Korea face and what our service members in Afghanistan would have endured after May.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. So the – the final question for me, then, is – I mean, are – is there an assessment now in the administration that essentially the process of the peace negotiation with the U.S. was essentially a gambit by the Taliban to get U.S. troops out, and once U.S. troops out – were out, they recognize that you would have no leverage to stop their advance, which seems to be exactly what happening? I mean, do you still believe that they negotiated with you guys in good faith?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, of course, this agreement was concluded in 2020, so – with the U.S. Government, of course, and that&#8217;s why – one of the reasons why it was important to honor it. But look, the idea that we don&#8217;t have leverage or that the Islamic Republic, the Government of Afghanistan doesn&#8217;t have leverage – that&#8217;s just not the case. The United States continues to have leverage, our – the international community, working closely with us, continues to have leverage, and the Afghan Government has tremendous leverage. Part of that is the numerical advantage that I spoke to before: 300,000 troops, an air force, special forces, heavy equipment, training, a commitment of partnership, continued support from the United States, $3.3 billion in the budget for continuing support to the ANDSF.</p>
<p>So the idea that the Taliban advance – continued Taliban advance is unstoppable, that there&#8217;s nothing that can stand in the way, that we&#8217;ll just have to watch it unfold, that is not the reality on the ground.</p>
<p>Conor.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Can I just follow up on that, and two other questions? You can&#8217;t compare the situation maybe to South Korea, but we have U.S. troops in Iraq who are under near-constant rocket fire as well. And they&#8217;re there to keep the situation stable against ISIS, a terror group. So how is that any different from what&#8217;s happening in Afghanistan, and why pull U.S. troops out from one country but leave them in another?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>It&#8217;s very difficult and dare I say impossible to compare one country to the next. You&#8217;re right that U.S. service members are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi Government in order – for one mission and one mission only, and that is in partnership for the counter-ISIS mission. We have similarly, when it comes to Afghanistan, been very clear – and this is one of our criteria that we have made clear to the Taliban; the President has made this clear to the American people and the international public – that we are determined that Afghanistan will never again become a staging ground for attacks against the United States. We believe and we are confident that we can do that through resources and capabilities that are so-called over the horizon, that aren&#8217;t stationed in Afghanistan but that we can call upon at a moment&#8217;s notice to disrupt a threat as it emerges.</p>
<p>The fact is that the security risks, that the danger that our service members would have been exposed to after May 1, when the Taliban would have deemed us to have been in violation of that agreement and our service members would once again – could well have once again become targets of attack, that is not a proposition this President was willing to accept. It wasn&#8217;t a proposition because this President prioritizes the security, the safety, the well-being of our service members, but this &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But why is that a proposition you’re willing to accept in Iraq, then, where they are under constant threat from rocket attacks as well?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The dynamic is entirely different. There is not an analogous situation on the ground. There is not an analogous agreement that was reached between – and even the idea of it sounds laughable – between the United States Government and ISIS. There is no analogous U.S.-ISIS agreement.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible.) It was – it was pretty laughable not so many years ago that there would ever be a deal between the U.S. and the Taliban.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just a second question, then.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You talk consistently about the Taliban paying a cost in the future, that they would be an international pariah, there would be no international assistance. Why haven’t you imposed the costs on the Taliban now for what’s happening? Why haven’t you imposed some sort of costs on their leadership for the atrocities that you say that their group is committing, for the ongoing offensive?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. It’s a good question. All tools – we have not taken any tool off the table except for this military presence on the ground. The Afghan Government continues to have a capable and highly numerically superior fighting force. They are imposing costs. They have the potential to impose even greater costs on the Taliban. Of course, there are other tools at our disposal that fall short of reintroducing U.S. forces. We have not ruled any of those out, and so if it’s appropriate for us to use them, we won’t hesitate to do so.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one last question: It’s three weeks now until the military withdrawal is supposed to be complete. The administration has committed to relocating 4,000 Afghan SIVs and their families, and that process hasn’t started. Do you realistically think – for the 4,000 who are going to third countries, do you realistically think that that is possible to complete within the next three weeks?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What the President said is that relocation flights would begin by the end of last month, and they did for this first group of SIV applicants. And let me just give you an update on that, because I know there’s great interest in this. So far, as of today, six flights have landed in the United States. We have relocated almost a thousand special immigrants and their family members as of August 10th. That number is, in fact, 995, so when we say almost, we mean almost. We are, of course, unable to preview upcoming flight schedules, but we expect to surpass that 1,000 number very shortly.</p>
<p>To date, approximately 60 percent of the Afghan special immigrants who arrived at Fort Lee have departed Fort Lee to begin their new lives in the United States with assistance from the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.</p>
<p>Let me mention one other point, because this will be important as to processing going forward: The State Department can now accept results of the so-called fit-to-fly medical exam that Afghan special immigrants participating in Operation Allies Refuge relocation flights must undergo for purposes of visa issuance. And so this accommodation has made it possible for more applicants to enter the United States with a visa in hand, conferring upon them lawful permanent residence status upon admission to the United States as a first-time arriving immigrant, and therefore negating the need for them to undergo additional processing at Fort Lee.</p>
<p>So, in other words, they are undergoing elements of this fit-to-fly medical exam in Afghanistan, in Kabul before they board, and so that will expedite their processing upon arrival in the United States. Many, if not most, of these special immigrants can now go directly to the relocation agencies to begin their new lives here in the United States.</p>
<p>Kylie.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just to follow up on that, so it’s 995 SIVs and their family members?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How many SIVs – like single applicants. Do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have that number, but 995 is the aggregate.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That includes the principal applicants and dependents.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And do you have any updates on flights to third countries or U.S. locations overseas?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, this is something – so as – so just to distinguish what we’re talking about, these so far 995 of the total 1,000 principal applicants, or approximately 4,000 within the group that had completed the security vetting, they are coming directly to the United States. There is a second larger group that has not completed – completed the chief of mission stage but not the security vetting. And so, as the President announced, they will be going to third countries. We have engaged a number of third countries; we’re continuing to have discussions with a number of our partners. Don’t have any details to share at this time, but as soon as we do, we will.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And then I just have one question: So we reported today that there is some active discussions underway about a further drawdown from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, and I understand it’s not going to be a major drawdown, but potentially a small drawdown is under consideration. And one thing that the department said is that the embassy in Kabul continues to pursue its full agenda of issues. And I’m just wondering, given everything that is unfolding on the ground there with the Taliban violence and gains, how the diplomacy and how the work that the embassy actually does on the ground has been impacted.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, it’s a very good question. Let me first talk about the staffing and security piece of it. As you know, in April, Embassy Kabul went on ordered departure status. That was in late April – April 27th, I believe it was. So our posture has not changed since then. What we have been doing, as we do for every diplomatic post in a challenging security environment, is to evaluate threats daily and to determine what the staffing posture that is in the best interests for those serving at the embassy and how we might be able to continue to keep them safe.</p>
<p>And so, of course, we do want to minimize the number of employees in Afghanistan whose functions can be performed elsewhere. And we spoke about this in the context of the SIV process. Instead of completing the chief of mission stage, having that processing done from Kabul, we’ve been able to do that from Washington, for example, or the Washington, D.C. area.</p>
<p>So that’s what we’re looking at, our – the point in all of this is that we intend for our partnership with the Afghan people to be enduring. In order for that to be the case, it’s important to have a diplomatic relationship and a diplomatic presence on the ground to do those functions that can’t be performed elsewhere. And there are a number of functions: the political element, the consular element that is important for that face-to-face diplomacy to take place under the auspices of our embassy.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So everything that you would like to do on the ground you’re able to do on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Obviously, it is a challenging security environment, and were we able, were we confident, were we comfortable having a larger staffing presence there, we would. But we are evaluating the threat environment on a daily basis. The embassy is in regular contact with Washington, with the most senior people in this building, who in turn are in regular contact with our colleagues at the NSC and the White House on this dynamic. But for right now, we have been able to continue those core activities that are important for us to conduct on the ground.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Sorry, if we can have a gradual break from Afghanistan &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-SOUTHKOREA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; I have a question for – so I have two questions. First one is State Department’s willingness to promote freedom of the press outside the United States. So South Korea’s Moon government and the ruling party is pushing a new law that obliges media outlets to pay punitive damages for spreading fake news. And as you have seen in the United States, labeling critical news stories as fake news is a typical way of attempting to stifle criticism. So South Korean journalist associations expresses deep concern.</p>
<p>And so my question is: I understand Biden administration wants to show unity between the allies, but as the administration promotes freedom of the press and liberal democracy in the world, will the administration acquiesce this undermining of democratic values just to avoid presenting split between the allies? And if not, can you share State Department’s plan to address this issue with South Korean counterparts?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I don’t have a specific reaction to offer on this particular development, but I will say, broadly, freedom of the press, freedom of expression is a value that the United States supports the world over. And we’ve demonstrated that in the context of the Republic of Korea. When Secretary Blinken was in Seoul and he, of course, visited Tokyo and Seoul on his first physical travel overseas, we met with – he met with a number of emerging South Korean journalists – that is to say, young journalists working for some of the country’s biggest outlets – to affirm this – these enduring values and enduring principles that we share with our like-minded allies and partners. And so freedom of expression is something that we continue to stand for and will stand for in that context and every context.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So you want to avoid the specific – this mentioning about this development, but do you think there will be a private diplomatic discussion about this issue?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I wouldn’t want to wade into what may or may not be conveyed privately.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-CHINA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So my second question is Chinese nuclear buildup. So last Friday, Secretary Blinken expressed the concern that China has deviated from its past strategy of minimum deterrence. Is it now the U.S. Government’s official assessment that China has discarded no-first-use policy and shifted to launch on warning?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I’m not going to weigh in on the PRC’s nuclear doctrine. I will leave that to them. What is – what we have said and I think what is becoming more and more obvious is that the PRC is building a larger and more diverse nuclear arsenal. Despite efforts to obfuscate this, this rapid buildup has become more difficult to hide, and it does suggest that China is deviating from decades of nuclear strategy based around minimum deterrence.</p>
<p>These advances at the same time highlight why we believe it is important that it’s in everyone’s interests that nuclear powers talk to one another, that we engage in nonproliferation dialogue directly to discuss reducing nuclear dangers and avoiding miscalculation. We encourage Beijing to engage with us on practical measures to reduce the risks of destabilizing arms races and conflict.</p>
<p>Of course, our Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman recently engaged in a round of Strategic Stability Dialogue with the Russian Federation. And it’s important that nuclear powers – China, of course, be among them – be open to professional dialogue and discussion, precisely to reduce the risk of these weapons.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-JAPAN"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Two new question about China. First one: Yesterday, the Secretary Blinken met Japanese new national security advisor Akiba and they reaffirmed the importance of the peace and the stability in the Taiwan Strait. So what kind of specific contributions or the actions do you expect Japan to take to keeping this stability?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, stability across the strait is an important principle that not only we seek to uphold, but that we’ve discussed with our partners in the region, including Japan. For our part – and I wouldn’t want to speak to Tokyo’s approach to this; that’s for them to offer – we will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait relations, consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people on Taiwan. We have urged Beijing – and you’ve heard similar statements from our allies and partners in the Indo Pacific – to cease its military, its diplomatic, its economic pressure against Taiwan and to engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-OLYMPICS"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> One more question is about Olympics. Now that the Tokyo Olympics are over – although we still have the Paralympics – but let me ask about the current stance of the United States on participating in the next Beijing Winter Olympic Games?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, you’re right that the Tokyo Olympic Games have now concluded. Of course, the Paralympic Games are ahead of us. But it is still mid-2021 – August is still mid, I suppose – so we are not – don’t want to wade in just yet on 2022 Olympics. We are, as we have said, consulting closely with our allies and partners to, in the first instance, define those common concerns and to establish a shared approach. But again, I don’t want to get ahead of where we are, given that we still have some time to go.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> North Korea?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Six months.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Six months away. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. And also mid-2021? Eight out of twelve is not exactly mid. You know, you’re on the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Math was never my forte. But you get the point.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-NORTHKOREA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On North Korea, do you have any response to the comment from Kim Jong-un’s sister about the U.S.-South Korea military exercise, calling Seoul “perfidious” yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have a specific response to the North Korean comments, but allow me to offer just a bit of context and – surrounding the policy from our side. First, let me reiterate that the joint military exercises are purely defensive in nature. We have made that point repeatedly, and it’s a very important one.</p>
<p>Second, as we have long maintained, the United States harbors no hostile intent towards the DPRK. We remain committed to the security of the Republic of Korea and our combined defense posture in accordance with our ironclad U.S.-ROK alliance. DOD may be able to provide additional details on these exercises, but the important point for us is that they are purely defensive in nature.</p>
<p>More broadly, and as we’ve said in recent weeks, we support inter-Korean dialogue. We support inter-Korean engagement, and we’ll continue to work with our ROK partners towards that end.</p>
<p>Yes. Let’s see, anyone who hasn’t – John, yeah.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-ETHIOPIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, on Ethiopia. The prime minister is now calling for a national war effort and mass enlistment in response to battlefield losses to Tigray rebels. Does the administration have any response, coming just a week after Samantha Power was in the country calling for a ceasefire?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, that continues to be our message. You heard it very forcefully. Ethiopian officials heard it very frankly from Ambassador Power. We have continued to call for dialogue and a cessation of hostilities. That is precisely what Ambassador Power said during her visit last week. During her visit last week, she also made the point during her press conference that enflamed rhetoric makes it more difficult for all parties to come to the table and negotiate an end to this conflict. The focus, as we see it, should be and must be on dialogue that is needed for an inclusive peace and importantly to end the suffering of the civilian people of Ethiopia.</p>

<p><a id="post-269346-LITHUANIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m just wondering, on this China and Lithuania situation, do you guys have anything to say about China now demanding that Lithuania withdraw its ambassador from Beijing, after they opened this office, the Taiwan embassy?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we do stand in solidarity with our NATO Ally Lithuania and we condemn the PRC’s recent retaliatory actions, including the recall of Beijing’s ambassador from Vilnius and demanding Lithuania recall its ambassador from Beijing. We support our European partners and our allies as they develop mutually beneficial relations with Taiwan and resist the PRC’s coercive behavior. Taiwan is a global leader in public health and advanced manufacturing and democratic governance, to name just a few areas in which the international community – including the United States – benefits from engagement with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Each country should be able to determine the contours of its own “one China” policy without outside coercion. We have done just that. Of course, we have spoken to how this administration is engaging with the people on Taiwan in accord with our “one China” policy. But for further details on this, I would refer you to the Government of Lithuania.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And I just – I assume therefore that you support, if other countries are considering opening Taiwan embassies in their country, if they want to do that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We support engagement.</p>
<p>I’ll – we’ll do Tracy, and then Daphne.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-CHINAISRAEL"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, thank you. Since we’re back on China, do you have any comment on or knowledge of, or better yet, confirmation of China’s supposed cyber-attack on Israel?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have anything for you on that. Of course, we have seen and we have taken action against China’s – the PRC’s malign activity in cyberspace. We have taken actions to attribute even just recently when it comes to the attack against the Microsoft Exchange Server, and the details of that attribution we made public. But when – and of course, DOJ has previously charged PRC officials for activities, malign activities in the cyber realm, but I don’t have a specific response on that for you.</p>
<p>Daphne.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-BURMA2"></a><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>A collection of more than 90 organizations have written to Secretary Blinken urging him to recognize the atrocities committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar as crimes against humanity and genocide.  You’ve been in office for nearly eight months now; why is the review of this determination taking so long?  And then is this a policy question rather than just looking at the facts?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So you heard – and I believe you asked Secretary Blinken for an update when he was here just a couple weeks ago. He said at the time that that evaluation of the facts and the law is ongoing. Of course, it’s important that we have a full understanding of the facts, of the law, and also the implications when it comes to any sort of designation.</p>
<p>What remains true, and what we’ve said before, is that many of the individuals who are now in leadership positions within the junta are and were responsible for the – for some of the alleged atrocities against the Rohingya. We continue to believe that they should be held to account for that, for their anti-democratic practices more recently, and we will continue to find ways to do just that. But I don’t have an update to offer on any – on that particular determination.</p>
<p>Conor.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Follow-up, related on Myanmar. Last week, Wendy Sherman had a phone call with Zin Mar, who is the sort of acting foreign minister of the National Unity Government. Should this be taken as a sign that the Biden administration is considering recognizing the NUG as the legitimate government in Myanmar?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what we’ve said is that we engage with – first of all, we are standing with the people of Burma, who very clearly still aspire to see their democracy restored. As part of our strong support for the people of Burma, we are engaging with the full range of civil society and pro-democracy groups that seek to do that, that seek to restore democratic governance.</p>
<p>To date, it has not only been Deputy Secretary Sherman but EAP bureau leadership and our U.S. ambassador to Burma. They’ve met with NUG leaders. We continue to deepen such engagement. When Deputy Secretary Sherman spoke to Zin Mar Aung last week, they discussed ongoing efforts to return Burma to a path to democracy, including continued U.S. support for the pro-democracy movement. They also discussed the toll of COVID-19 in Burma and efforts to provide critical humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma.</p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 3:06 p.m.)</p>

<p>2:13 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon. Happy Tuesday. A couple items at the top and then we’ll turn right to your questions.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-BURMA"></a> First, I want to call your attention and reiterate what U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in her written statement related to recent arrests made in the alleged plot targeting Burma’s permanent representative to the United Nations.</p>
<p>We are grateful, as she said, that law enforcement moved swiftly to respond to the horrific alleged plot to seriously injure or kill Burma’s permanent representative to the UN. The United States stands in solidarity with Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, who continues to demonstrate remarkable courage and bravery in speaking on behalf of the people of Burma who demand a return to democracy.</p>
<p>We are grateful this alleged plot, which was to have taken place on U.S. soil, was thwarted and that the suspected perpetrators were arrested and are now facing justice.</p>
<p>We unequivocally condemn this threat to Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, which fits a disturbing pattern of authoritarian leaders and their supporters reaching across the globe – including even into the United States – to persecute and repress journalists, activists, and others who dare speak or stand against them.</p>
<p>These acts of transnational repression must be met with the condemnation of the world and with full and certain accountability.</p>
<p>We will not stand for efforts by authoritarian regimes and their supporters and enablers to repress people on our soil or across borders, and we will continue to coordinate with allies and partners to stand against transnational repression everywhere.</p>
<p>And today, during her official visit to Thailand, U.S. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield announced more than $50 million in critical humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma, including for those forced to flee violence and persecution in the wake of the military coup.</p>
<p>This aid, provided by the State Department and USAID, will enable our international and NGO partners to provide emergency food assistance, life-saving protection, shelter, essential health care, water, sanitation, and hygiene services to the people of Burma.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-COVID"></a> In addition, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield announced $5 million in aid to help Thailand fight COVID-19.</p>
<p>This funding comes at a critical point of rising humanitarian needs, and will help mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on the lives of people of both Thailand and Burma.</p>
<p>We continue to urge other donors to generously support the urgent humanitarian needs of the people of Burma and to support the global efforts to combat COVID-19.</p>
<p>With that, I am happy to turn to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks. Sorry, I was late. I was on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Just in time.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-DEPARTMENT"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Just in time. I have a – one housekeeping item that I want to start with and then go to Afghanistan. It&#8217;s now been a little bit over two weeks – 15 days, I think – since the swastika was discovered in the elevator. Secretary came out, obviously condemned it, said there would be an investigation into it. What&#8217;s the result of the investigation?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, Matt, as you know, shortly after the swastika was discovered, the Secretary sent a note to the entire workforce. And he made clear in that note that hate has no home here. And nowhere is that tolerated, everywhere is it abhorrent, but here in this department, the – a department that stands for defending human rights, human dignity, the values of pluralism and inclusion around the world, that symbol is especially repugnant, and repugnant to the women and men of the department and to everyone who works here.</p>
<p>In the days after – and you heard directly from Secretary Blinken, I guess it was a week ago yesterday, on this – of course, President Biden has put forward a nominee for a special envoy to combat anti-Semitism, put forward a nominee for – to be an envoy for international religious freedom. And as Secretary Blinken noted in his message to the workforce, there is an investigation underway. I know this is a priority on the part of the investigators who are looking closely into this. I don&#8217;t have an update that I&#8217;m able to provide at the time, but if and when we do, I will certainly be able give you that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, far be it from me to say that something is taking a long time or not taking a long time, because I – but an elevator is a pretty small place, right? This building has got controlled access. It would seem to me that two weeks is more than enough to come up with a – to come up with some kind of explanation. And while you&#8217;re correct in saying that this kind of hate has no place and that the Secretary said that, this building also stands for accountability and transparency. So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Absolutely. Absolutely. And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So are you really telling me that two weeks after the fact, they can&#8217;t – they got no leads &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>The elevator is a small place. This building, as you know, is a large place.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah, but it’s not that big, Ned. Come on. It’s not that big. All right. If you don&#8217;t have anything, you don&#8217;t have anything.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I don’t have anything to offer now, but we &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>All right, let’s go on &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>&#8212; of course, do believe in the value of transparency. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re out here every day.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>And, of course, as soon as we have an update, we&#8217;ll be able to share that.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-AFGHANISTAN"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. Okay. On Afghanistan, I just want to make – get – does this administration believe that the Taliban is upholding its end of the deal that was signed in February 2020, the end of February 2020, in Doha?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So let me take a step back and offer some broader context, and I will come to that. I take it you&#8217;re coming at this question in light of the escalating violence and Taliban aggression.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, no, no. No reason at all.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay, okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, no. (Laughter.) It just occurred to me out of thin air.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So let me first comment on that and then we’ll come to it. The – what we are seeing – what we have seen in recent days and recent weeks – the violence, the loss of life, the aggression – it is of grave concern. It is of grave concern to this department. It is of grave concern to the entire United States Government. What we are doing around the clock is seeking to find a way out of this, and here in this department, in the Department of State, we are focused on the diplomacy that can eventually see a just and durable solution to this conflict.</p>
<p>And as part of that – the latest example of that diplomacy, as we announced last night – Ambassador Khalilzad is currently in Doha. He is there to advance a collective international response to what can only be termed as a rapidly deteriorating security situation. He will and has already taken part in several rounds of planned meetings in the coming days. Those meetings, including one today, have and will include representatives from the region as well as beyond and from multilateral organizations to press for a reduction in this violence and a ceasefire and commitment by the part of these regional and broader governments and multilateral and international institutions not to recognize any government that is imposed by force.</p>
<p>And this is something that – you’ve heard me say this recently, but it is not just our contention that any government that comes to power in Afghanistan at the barrel of a gun will lack international support and international legitimacy. It is, in fact, the consensus that has emerged and that has been stated any number of times. Just last week, the UN Security Council put out a statement, the final line of which said, “The members of the Security Council recall Resolution 2513, reaffirm that there is no military solution to the conflict, and declare that they do not support the restoration of the Islamic Emirate.” I went through last week a litany of countries, of international blocs and institutions that have signed on to this, this simple proposition that any government that comes to force in Afghanistan will lack legitimacy and, more practically, won’t have that international assistance that any government would almost certainly need to achieve any degree of durability.</p>
<p>So that is what Ambassador Khalilzad is there to seek to advance and seek to support. He will press the Taliban to stop their military offensive and to negotiate a political settlement. We, again, know that is the only path to stability, to development in Afghanistan. We also know the opposite is true, that if this violence continues, if the Taliban continues down this path, we are likely to see a prolonged, protracted period of violence, of instability. And that is not in anyone’s interest – certainly not in the interests of the people of Afghanistan and not in the interests of what the Taliban seek.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, I – yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Now, coming back to your original question, the U.S.-Taliban agreement – the application of it has been uneven. We have always – we have consistently said violence in Afghanistan – and this is perhaps clearer than it’s ever been – levels of violence are unacceptably high. That is true.</p>
<p>What is also true is that the Taliban has adhered to an important part of the U.S.-Taliban agreement.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But have they adhered to the whole thing?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What we’ve consistently said is that levels of violence are unacceptably high. But &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, if they haven’t adhered to the whole thing, do you have any recourse? Well, first of all, do you think that they are following their commitments, or are they in violation of that agreement? What’s happening right now on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The levels of violence are unacceptably high. What’s happening on the ground &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But that – that means nothing. Is that a violation?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; is unacceptable and is – it is not in the spirit &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Does that violate the deal that Zal negotiated? You’ve got him back there now, and if the Taliban are in violation of the agreement that they signed with him in – and Secretary Pompeo in February 2020, then why would you ever believe that they are – that anything that he could do there now would make any difference on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> There &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But the – the main question is: Are they violating the February 2020 agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Certainly the levels of violence do not appear consistent with what the Taliban pledged in that agreement. Let me make another point, though: There is another important element to that deal that is important for two reasons, and that, of course, is the proviso that they not target U.S. or coalition forces. The Taliban had not done so. That part of the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So they’re adhering to that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That part of the agreement &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So are they in violation of any other part of the agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> But let me &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> It’s a very easy question, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let me get to why that’s important. That’s important for a couple reasons.</p>
<p>One, it suggests because the same people on the Taliban side and the same people on our side who negotiated that 2020 agreement are – have been engaged in dialogue, engaged in discussion. And so the fact that an important element of the U.S.-Taliban agreement has been upheld suggests that, contrary to some speculation, what happens in Doha does have an impact on the ground in Afghanistan. It does suggest that there is room for diplomatic progress to be made. And that is what we are seeking to do. We are going to exhaust every diplomatic avenue, because we know the stakes if we fail to do that. The Afghan people know the stakes if there is not a negotiated agreement and a ceasefire that is put in place.</p>
<p>But there’s another reason that element of the U.S.-Taliban agreement is noteworthy, and this gets back to the decision that you heard directly from President Biden. The idea that the United States could have maintained a significant military presence in Afghanistan and that we would have found and encountered conditions that were just as we would have found them on April 30th of this year going into May 1 or May 2nd – that was just not tenable. It was not in the cards, and it was not in the cards because, according to that agreement that was negotiated by the United States – not this administration, but the previous one – if our forces remain there in great numbers after May 1, they could again have become targets of violence.</p>
<p>This President places great priority – the greatest priority – on the safety, the security, the well-being of our service members. So the idea that a force of a couple thousand U.S. military service members either would have been able to remain in Afghanistan with the status quo, or frankly that a force of that size would have been able to stand in the way of what we are seeing now – both of those propositions are hollow, and they’re hollow for the very simple reason that &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> They’re also unprovable. And I’ll stop, so – other people have questions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Follow-up, or joint &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Follow-up on Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> An EU official has said the Taliban now controls 65 percent of Afghanistan. Given its rapid takeover, is there any hesitancy or second thoughts with the U.S. thinking over Turkey’s effort to run the Kabul airport?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Taking – Turkey’s efforts to run the Kabul effort – airport?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The – what that gets to, what the Kabul airport represents, is something more than – you might say most airports – it’s more about – it’s more than air travel; it’s more than commercial travel, certainly. A secure, operational airport we feel is integral to our ability to have a functioning diplomatic presence on the ground. So the safety, the security, the continuing operation of that airport – it is of high importance to us. We are grateful that our Turkish partners have indicated a willingness to play a role in protecting that. Of course, Afghan Security Forces have an important role to play, too. But nothing that we have seen diminishes the importance we place on a functioning, safe, secure Hamid Karzai International Airport.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Have you picked up any hesitancy from the Turks on this issue?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> This is an issue that we have discussed, including at the highest levels, with our Turkish allies. President Biden, of course, discussed it with his counterpart, with President Erdogan. The department has discussed it in multiple levels. It is now principally a discussion that the Department of Defense is leading. As we always do, we keep those discussions in confidence, but we do appreciate Turkey’s willingness to take on an important role.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Following up &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; thank you – following up on the U.S.-Taliban agreement. Isn’t – to be more specific and try to get an answer – isn’t the Taliban violating the commitment not to attack cities and towns that was in the annexes of that agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That gets back to what we have consistently said. Levels of violence are too high. They are unacceptably high. That is why we are focused on diminishing the level of violence. We are doing this diplomatically; the State Department certainly is. But of course, the Afghans have a role to play, an important role to play – perhaps a more important role than they have had to play over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>And the other point is that yes, the Taliban have made gains; yes, the Taliban has inflicted horrific violence on their country, killing their fellow countrymen and women in the process, seemingly indiscriminately. At the same time – we’ve made this point before, but – the Afghan Government, the Afghan National Security Forces, far outnumber the Taliban – 300,000 – a capable fighting force of 300,000 troops, an air force that has modern weaponry, that has been trained by the United States, that just recently was provided with additional equipment. They have special forces. They have heavy equipment. So they have a capable fighting force.</p>
<p>For our part, we continue to support Afghan Security Forces. We’re committed to supporting those forces well into the future. You just look at what President Biden has requested in his budget request – $3.3 billion for the support of the Afghan Security Forces. That is a clear indication of our continuing support well into the future for these Afghan National Security Forces.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Was the withdrawal of the U.S. forces a condition-based withdrawal, and if yes, would you say that the Taliban are respecting their conditions of the withdrawal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Was our withdrawal conditions-based?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> No. Our withdrawal is not conditions-based, for the simple reason that it was preordained that a conditions-based withdrawal was essentially taken off the table. This administration could not – this President &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So why make a deal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So why make a deal if there was no conditions to the withdrawal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The deal closed the door on a conditions-based withdrawal. It’s a very important point. The U.S.-Taliban agreement stipulates a number of things. Among those things that it stipulates is that on May 1st of this year the United States was to withdraw its military forces. This was an agreement that was concluded in early 2020, a year before this administration came in. It was an agreement that – as President Biden said when he announced the military withdrawal, it’s a deal that this administration probably would not have made, certainly not in all the detail. But it’s a deal that we inherited.</p>
<p>And so that gets back to the point that it was never an option for the United States to maintain its forces. Or I should say it was never a viable option for this President, a president who prioritizes the safety, the security, the well-being of our service members, to maintain forces there in significant numbers after May 1, knowing that the status quo would not stand after May 1. From April 30th to May 1st, our service members would have become – could have become, once again – targets of violence. And that is something that had not happened since the U.S.-Taliban agreement. That was not a proposition this President, this administration, was willing to accept.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one last on Afghanistan for me. You’ve been issuing the same warnings to the Taliban for the last several days and weeks. They haven’t heard any of it. What makes you think that they will change their course now that they’re gaining and gaining cities and capitals?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Look, we have been very clear where we stand, but also where the international community stands. You’re seeing this reflected right now in Qatar, where the Qataris are hosting a series of meetings involving much of the region, much of the international community, to discuss and to ultimately advance this diplomatic project.</p>
<p>I think there’s also a misconception that in order for negotiations, peace negotiations, to take place there is the requirement that there be peace on the ground. In fact, if you look back through history, very rarely have peace negotiations taken place when peace is present on the ground. What we’re seeing is levels of violence that are of grave concern. They’re certainly not within the spirt of the U.S.-Taliban agreement. But we know that diplomacy is the only way that we are ever going to achieve a durable solution and, insofar as we are concerned, a just solution.</p>
<p>And so we have made very clear that in order for us and for our allies and partners to be able to recognize any future government of Afghanistan and to provide assistance to it, it must emerge from a political settlement that meets five criteria. First, it must be inclusive; second, it must respect the rights of all Afghans, including women and minorities; third, it allows the Afghan people to have a say in choosing their leaders; fourth, it must prevent Afghan soil from being used to threaten the United States and its allies and partners; and fifth and finally, it must respect its commitments in terms of international law and international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>We’ve made these criteria very clear to the Taliban. President Ghani, Chairman Abdullah have accepted these criteria for their part. We have discussed these criteria with our allies and partners. And for us, this will be the roadmap for recognition and for assistance to any future government of Afghanistan. It’s not – again, not just us. It is the countries in the region and well beyond that espouse this.</p>
<p>Nick.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, just a quick follow-up. So is there any circumstance under which the administration would consider stopping or reversing the troop withdrawal? Is there anything that the Taliban could do that would force this administration to do that, or are troops coming out no matter what?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, this gets back to I think what we were talking about before, but let me just say: Every commander in chief faces difficult choices. That’s really the nature of the role of commander in chief. If something reaches the desk of the president of the United States, any number of hundreds or thousands of people have probably mulled it over before with some degree of lack of consensus or consternation. President Biden made a very tough decision. He was clear that after 20 years of conflict, after our service members had accomplished the task that had been asked of them initially – the decimation of the network responsible for the 9/11 attacks, bringing Osama bin Laden to justice over 10 years ago – it was time for our troops to come home.</p>
<p>But the other relevant piece of this is that it gets back to what was in some ways preordained. The status quo was not an option. If we had announced a plan to extend our military presence or sustain it indefinitely, there was a risk, a not insignificant risk, that our service members would once again become the attempted targets of Taliban attacks and Taliban offensives.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>But so in – I mean, in other words, what you seem to be saying is that it&#8217;s okay if the Taliban don&#8217;t abide by their part of the deal because you&#8217;re acknowledging that there&#8217;s – the levels of violence are too high, but then at the same time, you&#8217;re saying listen, we had to abide by our promises under this deal, even if the Taliban did not abide by their promises.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, what we&#8217;re saying is that President Biden decided very firmly that our military service members would not be bargaining chips, that their lives would not be used as leverage for what we would all hope and seek to achieve in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So are you then – I mean, okay – I mean, the U.S. maintains troop presences in countries all over the world indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I would caution against comparing what U.S. forces Korea face and what our service members in Afghanistan would have endured after May.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. So the – the final question for me, then, is – I mean, are – is there an assessment now in the administration that essentially the process of the peace negotiation with the U.S. was essentially a gambit by the Taliban to get U.S. troops out, and once U.S. troops out – were out, they recognize that you would have no leverage to stop their advance, which seems to be exactly what happening? I mean, do you still believe that they negotiated with you guys in good faith?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, of course, this agreement was concluded in 2020, so – with the U.S. Government, of course, and that&#8217;s why – one of the reasons why it was important to honor it. But look, the idea that we don&#8217;t have leverage or that the Islamic Republic, the Government of Afghanistan doesn&#8217;t have leverage – that&#8217;s just not the case. The United States continues to have leverage, our – the international community, working closely with us, continues to have leverage, and the Afghan Government has tremendous leverage. Part of that is the numerical advantage that I spoke to before: 300,000 troops, an air force, special forces, heavy equipment, training, a commitment of partnership, continued support from the United States, $3.3 billion in the budget for continuing support to the ANDSF.</p>
<p>So the idea that the Taliban advance – continued Taliban advance is unstoppable, that there&#8217;s nothing that can stand in the way, that we&#8217;ll just have to watch it unfold, that is not the reality on the ground.</p>
<p>Conor.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Can I just follow up on that, and two other questions? You can&#8217;t compare the situation maybe to South Korea, but we have U.S. troops in Iraq who are under near-constant rocket fire as well. And they&#8217;re there to keep the situation stable against ISIS, a terror group. So how is that any different from what&#8217;s happening in Afghanistan, and why pull U.S. troops out from one country but leave them in another?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>It&#8217;s very difficult and dare I say impossible to compare one country to the next. You&#8217;re right that U.S. service members are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi Government in order – for one mission and one mission only, and that is in partnership for the counter-ISIS mission. We have similarly, when it comes to Afghanistan, been very clear – and this is one of our criteria that we have made clear to the Taliban; the President has made this clear to the American people and the international public – that we are determined that Afghanistan will never again become a staging ground for attacks against the United States. We believe and we are confident that we can do that through resources and capabilities that are so-called over the horizon, that aren&#8217;t stationed in Afghanistan but that we can call upon at a moment&#8217;s notice to disrupt a threat as it emerges.</p>
<p>The fact is that the security risks, that the danger that our service members would have been exposed to after May 1, when the Taliban would have deemed us to have been in violation of that agreement and our service members would once again – could well have once again become targets of attack, that is not a proposition this President was willing to accept. It wasn&#8217;t a proposition because this President prioritizes the security, the safety, the well-being of our service members, but this &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But why is that a proposition you’re willing to accept in Iraq, then, where they are under constant threat from rocket attacks as well?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The dynamic is entirely different. There is not an analogous situation on the ground. There is not an analogous agreement that was reached between – and even the idea of it sounds laughable – between the United States Government and ISIS. There is no analogous U.S.-ISIS agreement.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible.) It was – it was pretty laughable not so many years ago that there would ever be a deal between the U.S. and the Taliban.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just a second question, then.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You talk consistently about the Taliban paying a cost in the future, that they would be an international pariah, there would be no international assistance. Why haven’t you imposed the costs on the Taliban now for what’s happening? Why haven’t you imposed some sort of costs on their leadership for the atrocities that you say that their group is committing, for the ongoing offensive?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. It’s a good question. All tools – we have not taken any tool off the table except for this military presence on the ground. The Afghan Government continues to have a capable and highly numerically superior fighting force. They are imposing costs. They have the potential to impose even greater costs on the Taliban. Of course, there are other tools at our disposal that fall short of reintroducing U.S. forces. We have not ruled any of those out, and so if it’s appropriate for us to use them, we won’t hesitate to do so.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one last question: It’s three weeks now until the military withdrawal is supposed to be complete. The administration has committed to relocating 4,000 Afghan SIVs and their families, and that process hasn’t started. Do you realistically think – for the 4,000 who are going to third countries, do you realistically think that that is possible to complete within the next three weeks?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What the President said is that relocation flights would begin by the end of last month, and they did for this first group of SIV applicants. And let me just give you an update on that, because I know there’s great interest in this. So far, as of today, six flights have landed in the United States. We have relocated almost a thousand special immigrants and their family members as of August 10th. That number is, in fact, 995, so when we say almost, we mean almost. We are, of course, unable to preview upcoming flight schedules, but we expect to surpass that 1,000 number very shortly.</p>
<p>To date, approximately 60 percent of the Afghan special immigrants who arrived at Fort Lee have departed Fort Lee to begin their new lives in the United States with assistance from the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.</p>
<p>Let me mention one other point, because this will be important as to processing going forward: The State Department can now accept results of the so-called fit-to-fly medical exam that Afghan special immigrants participating in Operation Allies Refuge relocation flights must undergo for purposes of visa issuance. And so this accommodation has made it possible for more applicants to enter the United States with a visa in hand, conferring upon them lawful permanent residence status upon admission to the United States as a first-time arriving immigrant, and therefore negating the need for them to undergo additional processing at Fort Lee.</p>
<p>So, in other words, they are undergoing elements of this fit-to-fly medical exam in Afghanistan, in Kabul before they board, and so that will expedite their processing upon arrival in the United States. Many, if not most, of these special immigrants can now go directly to the relocation agencies to begin their new lives here in the United States.</p>
<p>Kylie.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just to follow up on that, so it’s 995 SIVs and their family members?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How many SIVs – like single applicants. Do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have that number, but 995 is the aggregate.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That includes the principal applicants and dependents.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And do you have any updates on flights to third countries or U.S. locations overseas?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, this is something – so as – so just to distinguish what we’re talking about, these so far 995 of the total 1,000 principal applicants, or approximately 4,000 within the group that had completed the security vetting, they are coming directly to the United States. There is a second larger group that has not completed – completed the chief of mission stage but not the security vetting. And so, as the President announced, they will be going to third countries. We have engaged a number of third countries; we’re continuing to have discussions with a number of our partners. Don’t have any details to share at this time, but as soon as we do, we will.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And then I just have one question: So we reported today that there is some active discussions underway about a further drawdown from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, and I understand it’s not going to be a major drawdown, but potentially a small drawdown is under consideration. And one thing that the department said is that the embassy in Kabul continues to pursue its full agenda of issues. And I’m just wondering, given everything that is unfolding on the ground there with the Taliban violence and gains, how the diplomacy and how the work that the embassy actually does on the ground has been impacted.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, it’s a very good question. Let me first talk about the staffing and security piece of it. As you know, in April, Embassy Kabul went on ordered departure status. That was in late April – April 27th, I believe it was. So our posture has not changed since then. What we have been doing, as we do for every diplomatic post in a challenging security environment, is to evaluate threats daily and to determine what the staffing posture that is in the best interests for those serving at the embassy and how we might be able to continue to keep them safe.</p>
<p>And so, of course, we do want to minimize the number of employees in Afghanistan whose functions can be performed elsewhere. And we spoke about this in the context of the SIV process. Instead of completing the chief of mission stage, having that processing done from Kabul, we’ve been able to do that from Washington, for example, or the Washington, D.C. area.</p>
<p>So that’s what we’re looking at, our – the point in all of this is that we intend for our partnership with the Afghan people to be enduring. In order for that to be the case, it’s important to have a diplomatic relationship and a diplomatic presence on the ground to do those functions that can’t be performed elsewhere. And there are a number of functions: the political element, the consular element that is important for that face-to-face diplomacy to take place under the auspices of our embassy.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So everything that you would like to do on the ground you’re able to do on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Obviously, it is a challenging security environment, and were we able, were we confident, were we comfortable having a larger staffing presence there, we would. But we are evaluating the threat environment on a daily basis. The embassy is in regular contact with Washington, with the most senior people in this building, who in turn are in regular contact with our colleagues at the NSC and the White House on this dynamic. But for right now, we have been able to continue those core activities that are important for us to conduct on the ground.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Sorry, if we can have a gradual break from Afghanistan &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-SOUTHKOREA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; I have a question for – so I have two questions. First one is State Department’s willingness to promote freedom of the press outside the United States. So South Korea’s Moon government and the ruling party is pushing a new law that obliges media outlets to pay punitive damages for spreading fake news. And as you have seen in the United States, labeling critical news stories as fake news is a typical way of attempting to stifle criticism. So South Korean journalist associations expresses deep concern.</p>
<p>And so my question is: I understand Biden administration wants to show unity between the allies, but as the administration promotes freedom of the press and liberal democracy in the world, will the administration acquiesce this undermining of democratic values just to avoid presenting split between the allies? And if not, can you share State Department’s plan to address this issue with South Korean counterparts?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I don’t have a specific reaction to offer on this particular development, but I will say, broadly, freedom of the press, freedom of expression is a value that the United States supports the world over. And we’ve demonstrated that in the context of the Republic of Korea. When Secretary Blinken was in Seoul and he, of course, visited Tokyo and Seoul on his first physical travel overseas, we met with – he met with a number of emerging South Korean journalists – that is to say, young journalists working for some of the country’s biggest outlets – to affirm this – these enduring values and enduring principles that we share with our like-minded allies and partners. And so freedom of expression is something that we continue to stand for and will stand for in that context and every context.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So you want to avoid the specific – this mentioning about this development, but do you think there will be a private diplomatic discussion about this issue?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I wouldn’t want to wade into what may or may not be conveyed privately.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-CHINA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So my second question is Chinese nuclear buildup. So last Friday, Secretary Blinken expressed the concern that China has deviated from its past strategy of minimum deterrence. Is it now the U.S. Government’s official assessment that China has discarded no-first-use policy and shifted to launch on warning?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I’m not going to weigh in on the PRC’s nuclear doctrine. I will leave that to them. What is – what we have said and I think what is becoming more and more obvious is that the PRC is building a larger and more diverse nuclear arsenal. Despite efforts to obfuscate this, this rapid buildup has become more difficult to hide, and it does suggest that China is deviating from decades of nuclear strategy based around minimum deterrence.</p>
<p>These advances at the same time highlight why we believe it is important that it’s in everyone’s interests that nuclear powers talk to one another, that we engage in nonproliferation dialogue directly to discuss reducing nuclear dangers and avoiding miscalculation. We encourage Beijing to engage with us on practical measures to reduce the risks of destabilizing arms races and conflict.</p>
<p>Of course, our Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman recently engaged in a round of Strategic Stability Dialogue with the Russian Federation. And it’s important that nuclear powers – China, of course, be among them – be open to professional dialogue and discussion, precisely to reduce the risk of these weapons.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-JAPAN"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Two new question about China. First one: Yesterday, the Secretary Blinken met Japanese new national security advisor Akiba and they reaffirmed the importance of the peace and the stability in the Taiwan Strait. So what kind of specific contributions or the actions do you expect Japan to take to keeping this stability?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, stability across the strait is an important principle that not only we seek to uphold, but that we’ve discussed with our partners in the region, including Japan. For our part – and I wouldn’t want to speak to Tokyo’s approach to this; that’s for them to offer – we will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait relations, consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people on Taiwan. We have urged Beijing – and you’ve heard similar statements from our allies and partners in the Indo Pacific – to cease its military, its diplomatic, its economic pressure against Taiwan and to engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-OLYMPICS"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> One more question is about Olympics. Now that the Tokyo Olympics are over – although we still have the Paralympics – but let me ask about the current stance of the United States on participating in the next Beijing Winter Olympic Games?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, you’re right that the Tokyo Olympic Games have now concluded. Of course, the Paralympic Games are ahead of us. But it is still mid-2021 – August is still mid, I suppose – so we are not – don’t want to wade in just yet on 2022 Olympics. We are, as we have said, consulting closely with our allies and partners to, in the first instance, define those common concerns and to establish a shared approach. But again, I don’t want to get ahead of where we are, given that we still have some time to go.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> North Korea?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Six months.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Six months away. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. And also mid-2021? Eight out of twelve is not exactly mid. You know, you’re on the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Math was never my forte. But you get the point.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-NORTHKOREA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On North Korea, do you have any response to the comment from Kim Jong-un’s sister about the U.S.-South Korea military exercise, calling Seoul “perfidious” yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have a specific response to the North Korean comments, but allow me to offer just a bit of context and – surrounding the policy from our side. First, let me reiterate that the joint military exercises are purely defensive in nature. We have made that point repeatedly, and it’s a very important one.</p>
<p>Second, as we have long maintained, the United States harbors no hostile intent towards the DPRK. We remain committed to the security of the Republic of Korea and our combined defense posture in accordance with our ironclad U.S.-ROK alliance. DOD may be able to provide additional details on these exercises, but the important point for us is that they are purely defensive in nature.</p>
<p>More broadly, and as we’ve said in recent weeks, we support inter-Korean dialogue. We support inter-Korean engagement, and we’ll continue to work with our ROK partners towards that end.</p>
<p>Yes. Let’s see, anyone who hasn’t – John, yeah.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-ETHIOPIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, on Ethiopia. The prime minister is now calling for a national war effort and mass enlistment in response to battlefield losses to Tigray rebels. Does the administration have any response, coming just a week after Samantha Power was in the country calling for a ceasefire?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, that continues to be our message. You heard it very forcefully. Ethiopian officials heard it very frankly from Ambassador Power. We have continued to call for dialogue and a cessation of hostilities. That is precisely what Ambassador Power said during her visit last week. During her visit last week, she also made the point during her press conference that enflamed rhetoric makes it more difficult for all parties to come to the table and negotiate an end to this conflict. The focus, as we see it, should be and must be on dialogue that is needed for an inclusive peace and importantly to end the suffering of the civilian people of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Kylie.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-LITHUANIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m just wondering, on this China and Lithuania situation, do you guys have anything to say about China now demanding that Lithuania withdraw its ambassador from Beijing, after they opened this office, the Taiwan embassy?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we do stand in solidarity with our NATO Ally Lithuania and we condemn the PRC’s recent retaliatory actions, including the recall of Beijing’s ambassador from Vilnius and demanding Lithuania recall its ambassador from Beijing. We support our European partners and our allies as they develop mutually beneficial relations with Taiwan and resist the PRC’s coercive behavior. Taiwan is a global leader in public health and advanced manufacturing and democratic governance, to name just a few areas in which the international community – including the United States – benefits from engagement with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Each country should be able to determine the contours of its own “one China” policy without outside coercion. We have done just that. Of course, we have spoken to how this administration is engaging with the people on Taiwan in accord with our “one China” policy. But for further details on this, I would refer you to the Government of Lithuania.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And I just – I assume therefore that you support, if other countries are considering opening Taiwan embassies in their country, if they want to do that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We support engagement.</p>
<p>I’ll – we’ll do Tracy, and then Daphne.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-CHINAISRAEL"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, thank you. Since we’re back on China, do you have any comment on or knowledge of, or better yet, confirmation of China’s supposed cyber-attack on Israel?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have anything for you on that. Of course, we have seen and we have taken action against China’s – the PRC’s malign activity in cyberspace. We have taken actions to attribute even just recently when it comes to the attack against the Microsoft Exchange Server, and the details of that attribution we made public. But when – and of course, DOJ has previously charged PRC officials for activities, malign activities in the cyber realm, but I don’t have a specific response on that for you.</p>
<p>Daphne.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-BURMA2"></a><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>A collection of more than 90 organizations have written to Secretary Blinken urging him to recognize the atrocities committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar as crimes against humanity and genocide.  You’ve been in office for nearly eight months now; why is the review of this determination taking so long?  And then is this a policy question rather than just looking at the facts?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So you heard – and I believe you asked Secretary Blinken for an update when he was here just a couple weeks ago. He said at the time that that evaluation of the facts and the law is ongoing. Of course, it’s important that we have a full understanding of the facts, of the law, and also the implications when it comes to any sort of designation.</p>
<p>What remains true, and what we’ve said before, is that many of the individuals who are now in leadership positions within the junta are and were responsible for the – for some of the alleged atrocities against the Rohingya. We continue to believe that they should be held to account for that, for their anti-democratic practices more recently, and we will continue to find ways to do just that. But I don’t have an update to offer on any – on that particular determination.</p>
<p>Conor.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Follow-up, related on Myanmar. Last week, Wendy Sherman had a phone call with Zin Mar, who is the sort of acting foreign minister of the National Unity Government. Should this be taken as a sign that the Biden administration is considering recognizing the NUG as the legitimate government in Myanmar?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what we’ve said is that we engage with – first of all, we are standing with the people of Burma, who very clearly still aspire to see their democracy restored. As part of our strong support for the people of Burma, we are engaging with the full range of civil society and pro-democracy groups that seek to do that, that seek to restore democratic governance.</p>
<p>To date, it has not only been Deputy Secretary Sherman but EAP bureau leadership and our U.S. ambassador to Burma. They’ve met with NUG leaders. We continue to deepen such engagement. When Deputy Secretary Sherman spoke to Zin Mar Aung last week, they discussed ongoing efforts to return Burma to a path to democracy, including continued U.S. support for the pro-democracy movement. They also discussed the toll of COVID-19 in Burma and efforts to provide critical humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma.</p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 3:06 p.m.)</p>
