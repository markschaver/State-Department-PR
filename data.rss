					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The following statement was released by United States Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and the Foreign Ministers of the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh/ISIS following today’s meeting.</p>
<p><em>Begin text:</em></p>
<p>The Ministers of the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh/ISIS, reconvening in-person after two years, met today in Rome at the invitation of Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Luigi Di Maio and U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. The Ministers reaffirmed their shared determination to continue the fight against Daesh/ISIS, and to create conditions for the enduring defeat of the terrorist group, which remains the Coalition’s sole purpose, through a comprehensive, coordinated, and multifaceted effort. The Ministers welcomed new members joining the Coalition &#8211; Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mauritania, and Yemen. Together the Ministers emphasized the protection of civilians as a priority and affirmed that international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, as applicable, as well as relevant UN Security Council resolutions, must be upheld under all circumstances.</p>
<p>The Ministers committed to strengthening cooperation across all Coalition lines of effort in order to ensure that Daesh/ISIS Core in Iraq and Syria, and its affiliates and networks around the world are unable to reconstitute any territorial enclave or continue to threaten our homelands, people, and interests. The Ministers remain firmly united in our outrage at atrocities perpetrated by Daesh/ISIS and in our determination to eliminate this global threat, and stand alongside survivors and families of victims of Daesh/ISIS crimes working for accountability.</p>
<p>Daesh/ISIS no longer controls territory and nearly eight million people have been freed from its control in Iraq and Syria, but the threat remains. The resumption in Daesh/ISIS activities and its ability to rebuild its networks and capabilities to target security forces and civilians in areas in Iraq and Syria where the Coalition is not active, requires strong vigilance and coordinated action. This includes allocating adequate resources to sustain Coalition and legitimate partner forces’ efforts against Daesh/ISIS, and significant stabilization support, both to address the drivers that make communities vulnerable to recruitment by Daesh/ISIS and related violent ideological groups, as well as to provide support to liberated areas to safeguard our collective security interests. In this regard, the Ministers noted the 2021 Pledge Drive for Stabilization as an important means to help sustain the recovery of areas liberated from Daesh/ISIS and prevent its resurgence. The Ministers reaffirm that Daesh/ISIS will continue to be pressured by curbing its ability to raise revenue, enhancing information sharing on terrorists through bilateral and/or multilateral channels like INTERPOL, and fighting against Daesh/ISIS’ toxic propaganda and denying the group space to exploit social media online.</p>
<p>The Ministers acknowledged Iraq’s efforts to counter Daesh/ISIS’ remnants and prevent its resurgence, and commended the increased capacity of the Iraqi forces to combat Daesh/ISIS. Appropriate measures to enhance the operational efficiency and coordination of our collective efforts to maintain the necessary pressure on Daesh/ISIS remain essential. The Coalition operates in Iraq at the request of the Government of Iraq in full respect of Iraq’s unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and to the benefit of the Iraqi people. The Ministers firmly condemned the continuing attacks against Coalition personnel and convoys, and diplomatic facilities, emphasizing the importance of the Government of Iraq protecting Coalition assets. The Ministers welcomed the incremental expansion of NATO’s non-combat advisory, training and capacity building mission in Iraq based on the requirements and consent of the Iraqi authorities and complementing the Coalition’s efforts. The Ministers also welcomed the EU’s support to the Iraqi authorities through the EUAM Iraq Mission.</p>
<p>In Syria, the Coalition stands with the Syrian people in support of a lasting political settlement in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2254. The Coalition must continue to be vigilant against the threat of terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, to build on the success it has achieved and continue to act together against any threats to this outcome and to avoid security vacuums that Daesh/ISIS may exploit. The Coalition continues to support inclusive local recovery and stabilization in areas liberated from Daesh/ISIS and reconciliation and reintegration efforts to foster conditions conducive to a Syria-wide political resolution to the conflict under the parameters of UN Security Council Resolution 2254.</p>
<p>In a session of the meeting focused on the security situation in other continents and regions, particularly Africa, the Ministers noted with grave concern that Daesh/ISIS affiliates and networks in sub-Saharan Africa threaten security and stability, namely in the Sahel Region and in East Africa/Mozambique. The Coalition is committed to working with affected countries to address the threats posed by Daesh/ISIS in Africa to ensure the enduring global defeat of the organization upon the request and prior consent of the countries concerned, and in full respect of international law and in close coordination with existing initiatives, notably the Coalition for the Sahel and the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. The Ministers welcomed the presence of delegations from several African nations as observers to this ministerial meeting. The Ministers discussed that reinforcing civilian state institutions and consolidating the rule of law, including law enforcement capacity, will be an essential component of combatting Daesh/ISIS, and that the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh/ISIS will seek to have effective engagement on the African continent. The Ministers tasked the Coalition Working Groups to assess ways in which they can contribute to counter Daesh/ISIS efforts in the affected regions. The Ministers also welcomed Afghanistan’s efforts to counter the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria-Khurasan (ISIS-K).</p>
<p>Recognizing the challenge posed by foreign terrorist fighters who are in custody, as well as their family members who remain in Syria and Iraq, the Ministers committed to pursuing existing effective justice and accountability mechanisms in close coordination with the countries of origin. This also includes accountability for fighters who have used sexual violence as an instrument of terror. The Coalition remains committed to promoting efforts to ensure that accused terrorists, including those of foreign nationalities, are treated appropriately and tried consistently with applicable international law obligations, including fair trial guarantees, and urges the custodians of the detained Daesh/ISIS terrorists to treat them humanely at all times, in accordance with international law.  The Ministers further recognized that the situation for Daesh/ISIS detainees and family members in northeast Syria is of grave concern and recognized the importance of finding a comprehensive and long-term solution to this serious issue.</p>
<p>The Coalition reaffirmed its belief that a comprehensive and collective effort remains necessary to achieve a full and enduring defeat of Daesh/ISIS worldwide. The Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh/ISIS has proven that it is a cohesive, responsive tool that has achieved notable successes through military, political, stabilization, counter-messaging, financial, and law enforcement lines of effort.</p>
<p>The Ministers also reaffirmed their intent to hold the next ministerial meeting of the Global Coalition by June 2022 and to hold a Small Group Political Directors Meeting in Brussels in the fall of 2021, circumstances pending.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Rome, Italy</p>
<p>Fiera Roma</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER DI MAIO:</strong>  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Mr. Secretary of State, dear Tony, dear colleagues, dear guests, welcome.  Welcome to Italy.  (Via interpreter) I’m delighted to welcome you here to Rome, to the ministerial meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, which I have the privilege of co-chairing with Secretary of State Blinken.  I wish to thank my colleague and friend Tony and the State Department for the excellent teamwork and the partnership with the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation which has brought us here.  The pandemic has shown us that only if we focus on multilateralism and international cooperation that we can adequately tackle the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>And this coalition is an example.  It brings together different continents.  It capitalizes on the contribution of each member.  It is flexible enough to take into account different viewpoints.  We have a good track record but a lot more remains to be done.  Daesh was defeated in its territorial dimension, but it hasn’t been uprooted, and that is why Italy, with over 800 units between Iraq and Kuwait, will continue to – while respecting Iraqi sovereignty and in agreement with the Baghdad agreement – will continue to keep its presence in support of local institutions so as to enable the country to tackle this threat autonomously.</p>
<p>We are also ready to increase our participation in the NATO commission in Iraq and to take over the command after Denmark.  Having consolidated our victory is important – consolidating it in Syria is essential in order to bolster the country’s stabilization.  That is why we support the 2254 resolution and the UN-guided operation.</p>
<p>The attacks in these recent months show that Daesh can still be a threat and attract certain segments of the population.  In order to consolidate the results achieved and limit the recruitment possibilities of Daesh and avoid its resurgence, we have to include civil initiatives to de-radicalize and stabilize the freed areas, giving social, economic conditions and opportunities to the local population so as to make them less vulnerable.  We are promoting these initiatives bearing in mind the key principles of our international approach, safeguarding human rights and the rule of law being our topmost priorities.</p>
<p>Despite the financial context, which has been worsened due to the pandemic, Italy is unswerving in its commitment in 2021.  We have planned to increase the resources earmarked for these activities.  Furthermore, we believe it is important to assess (inaudible) initiatives in favor of unaccompanied minors in (inaudible) camp, and to this end we are also in touch with players in the field.</p>
<p>Given the complexity and comprehensive nature of this problem, we need to work together in a joint approach.  We have to also take a comprehensive and targeted approach to dry up financial resources in the areas of activity of ISIS and in other parts of the world.  This is the aim of the Counter ISIS Finance Group, which Italy co-chairs with the United State and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Although the Daesh threat in Iraq and Syria is key in our coalition’s commitment, we must also take into consideration its global presence in the African continent and in the Sahel in particular.  The stability of this region is crucial for Europe and the broader Mediterranean.  I would like to thank the representatives from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mozambique who have accepted our invitation to attend today’s meeting as observers.</p>
<p>Italy will do its part.  It will be committed to promoting peace and sustainable development in this area which is a priority for our foreign policy action.  As I confirmed in our – my recent missions in the region, we will continue to reinforce our diplomatic presence, take part in main international missions, and make a contribution for a sustainable approach to migration via capacity building.</p>
<p>Given the growing threat stemming from Daesh in Africa, I would like to propose to my coalition partners to take into account the possibility of creating a working group or a platform that can focus specifically on Africa.  Such an initiative would also enable us to involve all African countries interested in making a contribution to our mutual benefit.</p>
<p>In concluding, I would like to renew my warm welcome to all in Italy.  I am confident that your remarks will be extremely helpful in bringing forward the discussion, and I would like to now call on the co-chair of the meeting, Antony Blinken. Secretary of State, over to you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Mr. Foreign Minister, Luigi, my friend, thank you so much.  And thank you for the extraordinary job in bringing us all together, and it’s wonderful to be with so many colleagues today.  Mostly, thank you for hosting what is a very important meeting.  And to all of the members of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS or Daesh, thank you for being part of this endeavor today, but also every day.</p>
<p>Since this coalition was created in 2014, our joint efforts by, with, and through our local partners have been a critical element in achieving ISIS’s territorial defeat in Iraq and in Syria.  Millions of civilians have been able to return to their homes.  The movement of foreign ISIS fighters from – into Syria and Iraq has virtually ceased.  And key ISIS leaders have either been captured or killed.  These achievements are significant and a reflection of what’s possible when we come together in common cause with a shared commitment.</p>
<p>But there is still more work to be done, and let me briefly outline what the United States sees as our top priorities now.  I think it will sound very familiar because it’s very much on track with what Luigi just said.  First, remaining ISIS elements in Iraq and Syria, though severely depleted, still aspire to conduct large-scale attacks, as we saw with January’s twin suicide bombings in Baghdad.  To sustain our military gains, we must reaffirm our commitment, including to Operation Inherent Resolve, the complementary NATO mission in Iraq, and to civilian-led counterterrorism capacity building.</p>
<p>Second, we must renew coalition support for stabilization assistance across Iraq and Syria, as Luigi said, to ensure that ISIS doesn’t have a resurgence in these countries.  Our stabilization assistance will address critical needs that the Syrians themselves have prioritized, deal with vulnerabilities previously exploited by ISIS, close gaps in local authorities’ capacities.  Those needs are particularly acute given the drought and economic downturn in Syria, which ISIS is seeking to exploit.</p>
<p>We’ve made good progress toward our 2021 fundraising goal for stabilization efforts in Iraq and northeast Syria.  We set out to raise $670 million.  I think we’re at close to $507 million now, so let’s keep going till we meet our goal.  Additionally, I can announce today that the United States will provide another $436 million in humanitarian assistance to Syrians and the communities that host them, bringing the total U.S. humanitarian assistance in response to the Syria crisis to nearly $13.5 billion.  Together we must stay as committed to our stabilization goals as we did to our military campaign that resulted in victory on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Third, 10,000 ISIS fighters remain in SDF detention in Syria.  This situation is simply untenable.  It just can’t persist indefinitely.  The United States continues to urge countries of origin, including coalition partners, to repatriate, rehabilitate, and, where applicable, prosecute their citizens.  Several countries have done good work on these fronts.  Kazakhstan has repatriated more than 600 fighters and family members and has enrolled many returnees in rehabilitation programs.  Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic have repatriated foreign terrorist fighter family members from Iraq, and in the case of Uzbekistan, from Syria and Afghanistan as well.  Several Balkan countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia have also repatriated foreign terrorist fighters.  And Italy, of course, has distinguished itself as one of the few Western European countries willing to return nationals from the region.  Most recently, they repatriated a female foreign terrorist fighter and her children.  Finland has also shown leadership in its repatriation of multiple families from Finland originally.</p>
<p>Fourth, ensuring the enduring defeat of ISIS also means effectively confronting ISIS threats outside of Iraq and Syria, in the place where ISIS – places where ISIS has recently focused its efforts.  In particular, we’re grateful for support from coalition partners for expanding counterterrorism capacity building efforts for countries on the front lines of the ISIS threat in Africa.  And again, I strongly support what the foreign minister said in that regard.  Let’s use today’s discussion to try to expand on coalition plans for effectively dealing with the threat in Africa, as well as how we’ll synchronize our efforts with national, regional, and international partners.</p>
<p>To recap some recent steps the coalition has taken very briefly, last November the United States and Nigeria convened a coalition meeting with representatives of West African states to discuss countering the ISIS threat in West Africa and the Sahel.  We’ve also held informal discussions among coalition partners on the pressing ISIS threat in northern Mozambique and the steps that we could take there.  Several of the coalition’s working groups are expanding their focus to include Africa.  For example, the Communications Working Group recently proposed an Africa framework paper to guide the coalition’s approach to countering ISIS in Africa in the information space by undermining the brand, exposing the recruitment narrative, increasing opportunities for dialogue, sharing positive alternative narratives to ISIS.</p>
<p>This is a vitally important effort.  We are seeing – I know you all know this – we are seeing fighters of 13 and 14 years old take up weapons to kill people, and we have to get at this from every possible angle.  And information work is vitally important.  We urge more coalition working groups – for example, the Counter-ISIS Finance Group – to follow suit and pay additional attention to ISIS and its – the problem it poses in Africa.</p>
<p>And recent coalition expansion efforts have focused on African nations, with the Central African Republic and Mauritania joining as our 82nd and 83rd members.  We’ll continue to encourage key frontline states and regional leaders in Africa to consider becoming members of this coalition.</p>
<p>On a final related note today, the United States is announcing the designation of Ousmane Illiassou Djibo as a specially designated global terrorist. Djibo is a senior leader and key lieutenant in ISIS Greater Sahara.  This designation is part of our continuing effort to counter ISIS financing in Africa.</p>
<p>Let me just conclude by saying how grateful the United States is for your partnership and commitment to defeating ISIS in Iraq, in Syria, everywhere in the world.  We’ve made great progress because we’ve been working together.  So we hope to keep our eye on the fight, to keep up the fight against this terrorist organization until it is decisively defeated.  Thank you very much.</p>

<p>We’ve made good progress toward our 2021 fundraising goal for stabilization efforts in Iraq and northeast Syria.  We set out to raise $670 million.  I think we’re at close to $507 million now, so let’s keep going till we meet our goal.  Additionally, I can announce today that the United States will provide another $436 million in humanitarian assistance to Syrians and the communities that host them, bringing the total U.S. humanitarian assistance in response to the Syria crisis to nearly $13.5 billion.  Together we must stay as committed to our stabilization goals as we did to our military campaign that resulted in victory on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Third, 10,000 ISIS fighters remain in SDF detention in Syria.  This situation is simply untenable.  It just can’t persist indefinitely.  The United States continues to urge countries of origin, including coalition partners, to repatriate, rehabilitate, and, where applicable, prosecute their citizens.  Several countries have done good work on these fronts.  Kazakhstan has repatriated more than 600 fighters and family members and has enrolled many returnees in rehabilitation programs.  Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic have repatriated foreign terrorist fighter family members from Iraq, and in the case of Uzbekistan, from Syria and Afghanistan as well.  Several Balkan countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia have also repatriated foreign terrorist fighters.  And Italy, of course, has distinguished itself as one of the few Western European countries willing to return nationals from the region.  Most recently, they repatriated a female foreign terrorist fighter and her children.  Finland has also shown leadership in its repatriation of multiple families from Finland originally.</p>
<p>Fourth, ensuring the enduring defeat of ISIS also means effectively confronting ISIS threats outside of Iraq and Syria, in the place where ISIS – places where ISIS has recently focused its efforts.  In particular, we’re grateful for support from coalition partners for expanding counterterrorism capacity building efforts for countries on the front lines of the ISIS threat in Africa.  And again, I strongly support what the foreign minister said in that regard.  Let’s use today’s discussion to try to expand on coalition plans for effectively dealing with the threat in Africa, as well as how we’ll synchronize our efforts with national, regional, and international partners.</p>
<p>To recap some recent steps the coalition has taken very briefly, last November the United States and Nigeria convened a coalition meeting with representatives of West African states to discuss countering the ISIS threat in West Africa and the Sahel.  We’ve also held informal discussions among coalition partners on the pressing ISIS threat in northern Mozambique and the steps that we could take there.  Several of the coalition’s working groups are expanding their focus to include Africa.  For example, the Communications Working Group recently proposed an Africa framework paper to guide the coalition’s approach to countering ISIS in Africa in the information space by undermining the brand, exposing the recruitment narrative, increasing opportunities for dialogue, sharing positive alternative narratives to ISIS.</p>
<p>This is a vitally important effort.  We are seeing – I know you all know this – we are seeing fighters of 13 and 14 years old take up weapons to kill people, and we have to get at this from every possible angle.  And information work is vitally important.  We urge more coalition working groups – for example, the Counter-ISIS Finance Group – to follow suit and pay additional attention to ISIS and its – the problem it poses in Africa.</p>
<p>And recent coalition expansion efforts have focused on African nations, with the Central African Republic and Mauritania joining as our 82nd and 83rd members.  We’ll continue to encourage key frontline states and regional leaders in Africa to consider becoming members of this coalition.</p>
<p>On a final related note today, the United States is announcing the designation of Ousmane Illiassou Djibo as a specially designated global terrorist. Djibo is a senior leader and key lieutenant in ISIS Greater Sahara.  This designation is part of our continuing effort to counter ISIS financing in Africa.</p>
<p>Let me just conclude by saying how grateful the United States is for your partnership and commitment to defeating ISIS in Iraq, in Syria, everywhere in the world.  We’ve made great progress because we’ve been working together.  So we hope to keep our eye on the fight, to keep up the fight against this terrorist organization until it is decisively defeated.  Thank you very much.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Today, the United States is designating Ousmane Illiassou Djibo – also known as Petit Chapori – as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under section 1(a)(ii)(B) of Executive Order (E.O.) 13224.</p>
<p>As a result of this designation, U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with Djibo.  His property and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked.</p>
<p>Ousmane Illiassou Djibo, a native Nigerien, is an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in the Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS) leader operating in the Menaka Region of Mali. Djibo is a close collaborator and key lieutenant of ISIS-GS leader, Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi. Djibo directed subordinate ISIS-GS members to develop a network to kidnap or attack westerners in Niger and surrounding areas. Djibo has also taken part in numerous assaults on local forces. He led ISIS-GS fighters in the July 1, 2019 attack on the Nigerien Armed Forces (FAN) base in Inates, Tillaberi Region, Niger, and also provided the order for ISIS-GS fighters to take six Nigerien soldiers hostage during an ambush on Nigerien soldiers near Tongo Tongo on May 14, 2019.</p>
<p>ISIS-GS, which was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and SDGT in May 2018, continues to threaten the peace, security, and stability of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. ISIS-GS emerged when Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi and his followers split from Al-Mourabitoun, an al-Qa’ida splinter group and U.S.-designated FTO and SDGT.  Al-Sahrawi first pledged allegiance to ISIS in May 2015, and ISIS acknowledged the pledge in October 2016.</p>
<p>Today’s designation notifies the U.S. public and the international community that Ousmane Illiassou Djibo is a leader of a terrorist organization.  Terrorist designations expose and isolate entities and individuals, and limit their access to the U.S. financial system.  Moreover, designations can assist the law enforcement activities of U.S. agencies and other governments.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Rome, Italy</p>
<p>Westin Excelsior</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER LAPID:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello, everybody.  Secretary Blinken and I represent new administrations, yours a few months old, ours a few weeks old, and two days.  But we also represent a very long and strong tradition of close friendship and cooperation.  There is no relationship more important to Israel than the United States of America.  There is no loyal friend of the United States of America than Israel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few years, mistakes were made.  Israel’s bipartisan standing was hurt.  We will fix those mistakes together.  In the past few days I spoke with a series of American leaders, both Democrats and Republicans.  I reminded them all that we share America’s most basic values – freedom, democracy, free markets, the constant search for peace.  In the struggle for those values, Secretary Blinken is a great partner and a great friend.  Like me, he grew up in the home of a Holocaust survivor who always said that the world has a responsibility to ensure Israel’s peace and security.  Mr. Secretary, I know we can count on you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will have disagreements, but they are not about the essence, they’re all about how to get there.  We want the same things.  We sometimes disagree about how to achieve them.  Israel has some serious reservations about the Iran nuclear deal that is being put together in Vienna.  We believe the way to discuss those disagreements is through direct and professional conversation, not in press conferences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Secretary, this is also the time to thank the United States for its support of Israel’s normalization efforts in the region.  In a couple of days, I will make the first trip, official trip by an Israeli minister to the United Arab Emirates.  That visit will be historic and I hope it will be the first of many.  I look forward to working with you to widen the circle of peace in our region.  That is the best way to bring stability and prosperity to the Middle East.  We will discuss a range of issues which concerns Israel, including strengthening our ability to defend ourselves, working to minimize conflict between us and the Palestinians, while making life better for Israelis and Palestinians alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I finish, I’d like to take this opportunity, and I know, Mr. Secretary, that you will join me, to send our prayers to all those affected by the collapse of the building in Miami.  Our deepest condolences to the family of those killed in this terrible, terrible tragedy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Well, Foreign Minister Yair, thank you.  We had an opportunity to meet actually before the change of government, when I was in Israel a few weeks ago.  We’ve been on the phone a number of times since.  But I’m very glad, first of all, to see you and to see you in these new functions.  And you’re right, we’re both relatively new to the job.  I suspect you’ll find – you’ve already found quickly – that the inbox fills up very fast.  But I’m grateful for the opportunity to work with you, to work with your team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the foreign minister is exactly right:  Even though our administration is relatively new and his is extremely new, the foundation that we’re working on is one of an enduring partnership, relationship, friendship between the United States and Israel, and it is based, as the foreign minister said, on a set of shared values and shared interests.  And I very much look forward to working closely with you, with your team, across a whole series of issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a number of things that the foreign minister has already noted that will be on our agenda.  We have, of course, the situation in Gaza where there’s an urgent need both for humanitarian assistance and, more broadly, reconstruction.  I know we’ll talk about that.  The work, I hope, can be done to, as you say, offer a more hopeful future for everyone – Palestinians and Israelis alike – with equal measures of opportunity and dignity.  It is very important from our perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You rightly noted our strong support for the normalization agreements, the Abraham Accords with Israel’s neighbors and beyond.  We strongly support this and hopefully there’ll be other participants.  I think we’ve also discovered or perhaps rediscovered that as important as they are, as vital as they are, they are not a substitute for engaging on the issues between Israelis and Palestinians that need to be resolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that, we have many, many things to talk about when it comes to the region and beyond, including Iran.  I very much look forward to that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But let me finish where we both started, and you said it extremely well:  We’re – as the closest of friends do, we will have occasional differences.  We have the same objectives; sometimes we differ on the tactics.  And we, I think, are very clear and direct with each other when that’s the case.  And that’s exactly the way it’s supposed to be.  But the foundation is a commitment, a deep, enduring, abiding commitment on the part of the United States to Israel’s security and a commitment that President Biden brought with him to office and feels very, very strongly about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So thank you for being here, for taking the time to get here.  It’s great to see you face to face, and we can get down to work.  Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the foreign minister is exactly right:  Even though our administration is relatively new and his is extremely new, the foundation that we’re working on is one of an enduring partnership, relationship, friendship between the United States and Israel, and it is based, as the foreign minister said, on a set of shared values and shared interests.  And I very much look forward to working closely with you, with your team, across a whole series of issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a number of things that the foreign minister has already noted that will be on our agenda.  We have, of course, the situation in Gaza where there’s an urgent need both for humanitarian assistance and, more broadly, reconstruction.  I know we’ll talk about that.  The work, I hope, can be done to, as you say, offer a more hopeful future for everyone – Palestinians and Israelis alike – with equal measures of opportunity and dignity.  It is very important from our perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You rightly noted our strong support for the normalization agreements, the Abraham Accords with Israel’s neighbors and beyond.  We strongly support this and hopefully there’ll be other participants.  I think we’ve also discovered or perhaps rediscovered that as important as they are, as vital as they are, they are not a substitute for engaging on the issues between Israelis and Palestinians that need to be resolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that, we have many, many things to talk about when it comes to the region and beyond, including Iran.  I very much look forward to that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But let me finish where we both started, and you said it extremely well:  We’re – as the closest of friends do, we will have occasional differences.  We have the same objectives; sometimes we differ on the tactics.  And we, I think, are very clear and direct with each other when that’s the case.  And that’s exactly the way it’s supposed to be.  But the foundation is a commitment, a deep, enduring, abiding commitment on the part of the United States to Israel’s security and a commitment that President Biden brought with him to office and feels very, very strongly about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So thank you for being here, for taking the time to get here.  It’s great to see you face to face, and we can get down to work.  Thank you.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Rome, Italy </p>
<p>Villa Taverna</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MR SMITHAM:  (In progress) to the team.  Is that okay?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More seriously, let me just, on behalf of the Tri-Mission and my colleagues Jenny and Patrick, welcome you, Mr. Secretary, to Rome.  A lot of what we do in diplomacy is build relationships, so let me just make a couple of introductions.  Mr. Secretary, this is your Tri-Mission Italy team.  It’s been a fantastic team that works every day to promote our interests and our joint interests with our partners here in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve got to highlight that over the past 16 months, this has been more of a struggle than it had been before.  It’s hard to imagine on a beautiful sunny afternoon like this in Rome, what we’ve been going through for the past 16 months.  But on February 23rd we got a call about COVID, weren’t sure exactly what it was.  It was in the north of the country and we had to really react quickly to make sure that this community stayed safe and secure.  And this is the team that kept our community safe and secure throughout the many months when you couldn’t leave your house, couldn’t leave your neighborhood, then couldn’t leave your region, and now Italy is a bit open, or more open, and so we’re able to get out and about.  This is the team that built resilience among our community.  Our CLO has been fantastic in doing that as well as our medical staff and the rest of our management team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team, this is Secretary Blinken.  I don’t think he needs much of an introduction as he’s had a distinguished career in public service and in the private sector for the past 30 years.  But let me just highlight a couple of things.  We just had a very substantive meeting with the foreign minister of Italy and I understand with some UN officials as well.  But let me just highlight something else.  We’ve talked a little bit about COVID here, and I want to let you know that because of the Secretary and because of his tireless advocacy in Washington, he’s been making sure that we have the tools to keep our community safe and secure.  And the vaccines arrived here a couple of months ago due to the pressure that the Secretary and his team placed on other officials in Washington to make sure that our diplomatic communities around the world had access to the same vaccines that our team back in Washington had access to.  And I think for that, Mr. Secretary, we all owe you a big thanks and want to congratulate you and your team for bringing that about for our entire Foreign Service and broader diplomatic community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without further ado, let me introduce Antony Blinken, the 71st Secretary of State of the United States of America.  Mr. Blinken.  (Applause.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, thank you all very, very much, and Tom, thank you not just for your very kind words but thank you for your remarkable leadership here, and Jenny and Patrick, to both of you as well.  I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it, we appreciate it, the President appreciates it.  And I have to say, by the way, I’ve had an opportunity now getting out and about a little bit to talk to the teams at our missions in a number of places around the world.  I think you’re winning the prize for best setting today, so thank you.  (Laughter.)  And it’s really great to see everyone here.  As I’ve been saying, we’ve been – we were distant for a long time.  It’s been – it still is a little bit mask to mask; we’re getting to face to face.  But we’re getting there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I have to say, picking up where Tom left off, I know how challenging this last year and a half has been on a personal level for so many of you as well, of course, as on a professional level.  On a personal level, I know that there are a number of you here who have been directly affected by COVID, who’ve had a loss, family, friend, and that in and of itself is a profoundly life-changing thing.  But then to carry on the mission in the midst of that, and not only carry it on but do it so well and to come together as a community, I can’t tell you how grateful I am and we are for that.  Because being able to do the job in the midst of COVID – hats off for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italy in particular, as Tom noted, was hit hard by multiple waves.  I think the fact that you were able to keep going and do it so well speaks volumes.  And yeah, we did have a challenge at the department.  When I was talking to our colleagues in the previous administration, there was – as we were doing the transition, there was the hope that the department would get 300,000 vaccines last December.  We got 13,000.  So we’ve been playing catchup ever since, and one of the things that I am very pleased with is the fact that thanks to a remarkable team back in Washington, but also extraordinary medical units, including here, we’ve been able to do that.  And by the way, as we were finally getting vaccines in, we were pushing 85 percent of what we got out to our missions in the field.  That was the number one priority.  And my number one priority as Secretary of State is to do what I can to look out for your safety, for your health, and for your wellbeing because you’re putting yourselves on the line for our country every single day, and that’s the least that we owe you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me say, too, more broadly, I can’t think of a more important time for you to be doing what you’re doing on behalf of our country.  And it really comes down to this, and COVID is a great example but there are many, many more.  Virtually all of the big issues that we have to contend with that are actually having an impact on the lives of our fellow citizens back home as well as people around the world – whether it’s COVID, whether it’s climate, whether it’s the disruptive impact of all these new technologies that are shaping our lives – we know that not a single one can be effectively dealt with by any one country acting alone, even the United States with all of our resources and power.  There is a greater premium than ever before, at least in the time I’ve been working on this, to cooperate, to find ways to work with other countries through international institutions, if we’re going to get the job done.  And the hard reality is there is no wall high enough or strong enough to keep these problems at bay.  We have to find ways to cooperate, and that’s exactly where all of you come in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every single day, you are on the front lines of building, strengthening, making even better our cooperation with one of our most critical partners and friends, Italy.  And we’re seeing the results of that every single day.  Just in what we’re doing here on these couple of days, between the bilateral work that we’re doing and, as Tom said, we had a terrific lunch with Foreign Minister Di Maio where we covered a lot of ground.  I’m really glad that there were multiple courses because we had so much to cover that if we had gotten – just had two courses, we never would have gotten through the agenda.  So I’m a little worried about dinner, but that’s another matter.  (Laughter.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then you see the work that Italy is doing, its own leadership, with our support, bringing together the counter-ISIS coalition here, its leadership of the G20, work on Syria, on so many other things.  This is a demonstration in practice of this cooperation actually producing results, because ultimately that’s what it’s all about.  We have to demonstrate through this work that we’re doing, the work that you’re doing, that our country, our democracy can deliver real results for our people and hopefully for people around the world.  And it does not happen without you.  So I really mostly wanted this opportunity to say thank you for everything you’re doing to help lead our diplomacy and to demonstrate that we can actually produce results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of people I actually want to give a quick shout-out to because so many of you have really stepped up, but there are a few that, besides Tom for his incredible leadership during this pandemic, I want to give a shout-out to a few folks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The management section at Tri-Mission, especially management officer Ken Meyer, who I think – is he here?  Is Ken here somewhere?  Let’s see.  Well, if he’s not here, I just want to say thank you for leading the COVID Tri-Mission Task Force.  Again, the work that was done here to try to deal with, contend with, and manage COVID is remarkable.  The mission health unit – I mentioned this a minute ago, and I don’t know if Rosa Tavano is here.  But to Rosa, to the entire team there, the work that you did to care for everyone – to care for the staff, to keep people informed, to oversee a very successful vaccination campaign – thank you, thank you, thank you.  And there goes my other thing.  Thank you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community liaison office, Janene LeMay – I don’t know if you’re here – Eric Oakley, Linda Modinger.  Keeping spirits up, a very important thing to do during COVID – I understand there were virtual happy hours.  I may not report that back to Washington, but I still think that’s a very good thing.  Wine tastings – virtual, but still very effective – tours, et cetera.  All of this, I say it a little bit in gest, but not, because keeping the mission together and focused, keeping morale high at this incredibly difficult time, that in and of itself was a critical mission and I’m grateful to the people who took that on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we’re now at a point where, as you know, Italy recently lifted most of its commercial restrictions.  More things are going forward in the weeks ahead.  U.S. tourists are coming back on COVID-tested flights.  To my knowledge, there hasn’t been a single – I shouldn’t even say this, but has not been a COVID case in the Tri-Mission in a number of weeks.  And I think today, hopefully, this is a little bit of a taste of what the very near future is going to look like.  And I know we are all incredibly anxious to get back to a semblance of life as we knew it, but we’re getting there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, a few things I want to mention as well.  Six of you have 40 years of service or more to this mission, and that is in and of itself an extraordinary thing.  But I think – let me see, is our minister counselor for public affairs Beth Poisson here?  Beth, are you here anywhere?  Well, 40 years of service – extraordinary.  Special consular services assistant Domenico Taliani, 40 years of service.  Cultural affairs specialist Marzia Benini, supervisory financial assistant Maurizio Cicerchia – excuse me if I have the pronunciation wrong – motor vehicle services technician Stefano D’Amadio, administrative clerk Paolo Zuccheri.  It’s hard to put into words how much your work, your collaboration, your partnership has meant, and 40 years is truly extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I especially want to say to those of you who are part of the locally employed staff, thank you, thank you, thank you.  I say this everywhere I go.  I mean it profoundly.  The locally employed staff are the lifeblood of our missions around the world.  No one does more for the connectivity between our missions and the country that we’re serving in than this team.  And to those of you who are locally employed staff, I am truly grateful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to everyone here, whether you work for the State Department, whether you work for I think more than 10 agencies represented at this mission, whether you are a direct hire, whether you’re locally employed staff, whether you’re one of the 33,000 servicemembers or a family member of anyone working here, for each and every one of you, your contribution is invaluable.  And each and every one of you is, in the truest sense of the term, a representative of our country, of the United States and for the partnership and relationship between the United States and Italy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our countries are celebrating 160 years of diplomatic relations.  It is genuinely one of the most important relationships we have.  But again, it ultimately comes down to you, to the work that you’re doing every day.  And so in this remarkably beautiful setting, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">grazie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</span></p>
