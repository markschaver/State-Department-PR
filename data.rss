					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Coinciding with the 16th meeting of the Counter ISIS Finance Group (CIFG) of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the United States is designating today five individuals participating in an ISIS network of financial facilitators operating across Indonesia, Syria, and Turkey.  The United States, Italy, and Saudi Arabia co-lead the CIFG, which comprises nearly 70 countries and international organizations and coordinates efforts against ISIS financial support networks worldwide.  The United States is committed to working with the Global Coalition to deny ISIS the ability to raise and move funds across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The individuals designated today, pursuant to Executive Order 13224, as amended, have facilitated the travel of violent extremists to Syria and other areas where ISIS operates.  By designating them, we aim to expose and disrupt an international ISIS facilitation network that has financed ISIS recruitment, including of vulnerable children in Syria.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the American people, I join the citizens of the European Union in celebrating Europe Day.</p>
<p>On this day, 72 years ago, French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman put forward the idea for what would eventually become the European Union.  His vision became real 30 years ago with the signature of the Treaty on European Union in Maastricht.  Schuman’s animating principle was that closer cooperation and creative thinking could bring about lasting peace in Europe and around the world.  That same spirit continues to inspire cooperation both within the EU and across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The U.S.-EU partnership has grown deeper and stronger in the decades since, expanding to encompass the full range of regional and global challenges that we face together.  Alongside our EU partners and friends, we have brought to life the prospect of cooperation and creativity that Schuman and so many leaders on both sides of the Atlantic envisioned.</p>
<p>Today’s U.S.-EU relationship is a forward-looking partnership that seeks not only to respond to the crises we face but also to build the opportunities of the future.  From working to end the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to tackling the climate crisis, from strengthening our cooperation on technology and the digital economy to advocating for human rights and democracy within our own borders and worldwide, the United States and EU are working together more closely than ever to make the world a safer and more resilient place where all people can live in dignity and freedom.</p>
<p>The Russian government’s brutal and unjustified war against Ukraine has made clearer than ever the urgency of promoting and defending the values and ideals that the EU and the U.S.-EU relationship represent.  It has also demonstrated how the dream of a Europe whole, free, and at peace continues to motivate those in Europe and beyond working for a more secure, more just, and more prosperous world.</p>
<p>Today, on Europe Day, I extend my congratulations and warm wishes to the European Union’s citizens, member states, and institutions.</p>

<p>Highlighting the deepening ties of friendship between the United States and Qatar, the Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), the U.S. Mission in Doha, and other U.S. and local officials broke ground today for a new U.S. Embassy in Qatar’s capital city.</p>
<p>Located on a 12.3-acre site in a new diplomatic zone in Doha’s Wadi al Banat district, the new U.S. Embassy will support the continued expansion of U.S.–Qatari diplomatic, security, and commercial relations.</p>
<p>Richärd Kennedy Architects of Phoenix, Arizona, is the design architect, American International Contractors Inc. (Special Projects), of McLean, Virginia, is the Design/Build contractor, and KCCT of Washington is the Architect of Record.  An estimated $110 million will be invested in the local economy and approximately 1,200 third-country nationals will be employed during construction.  The new U.S. Embassy is scheduled for completion in 2026 and will provide a future-forward, resilient platform for diplomacy in Doha.</p>
<p>Since the start of the Department’s Capital Security Construction Program in 1999, OBO has completed 171 new diplomatic facilities.  OBO currently has more than 50 active projects in the design phase or under construction worldwide.</p>
<p>OBO provides safe, secure, functional, and resilient facilities that represent the U.S. government to the host nation and that support U.S. diplomats in advancing U.S. foreign policy objectives abroad.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Eighty years ago, the United States and Australia formed an unprecedented partnership just months after the attack on Pearl Harbor and the bombings of Darwin and Broome.  This partnership has endured and strengthened as our nations have commemorated the 80th Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea.</p>
<p>Our countries joined forces and our service members fought side-by-side for four days in what would become a turning point in the war in the Pacific.  Our nations are forever grateful for the heroism demonstrated by those courageous Americans and Australians.  We will always remember the sacrifice they made for the cause of freedom in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The battle paved the way for an alliance that today is a foundational underpinning to the stability of the region and for democracy in the Indo-Pacific. We remain committed to our shared values and a shared vision for the region for the years to come.</p>
<p>Whether we are combating the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening our economies, or advancing peace and prosperity, the United States and Australia continue to be steadfast allies for each other and the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The text of the following statement was released by the G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union.</p>
<p><i>Begin Text:</i></p>
<p>We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, underscore our grave concern over the selection process for the Chief Executive in Hong Kong as part of a continued assault on political pluralism and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p>Last year, PRC and Hong Kong authorities moved away from the ultimate aim of universal suffrage as set out in Hong Kong’s Basic Law by increasing the number of non-elected members appointed to the Election Committee and dramatically curtailing the number of voters eligible to participate in the Committee elections.</p>
<p>The current nomination process and resulting appointment are a stark departure from the aim of universal suffrage and further erode the ability of Hong Kongers to be legitimately represented. We are deeply concerned about this steady erosion of political and civil rights and Hong Kong’s autonomy. We continue to call on China to act in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and its other legal obligations.  We urge the new Chief Executive to respect protected rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, as provided for in the Basic Law, and ensure the court system upholds the rule of law.</p>
