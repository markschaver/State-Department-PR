					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States notes with concern the growing tensions in South Sudan, including recent clashes between the South Sudan People’s Defense Force’s (SSPDF) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army/Movement-In Opposition (SPLA/M-IO) in Upper Nile state.  We call for both sides to observe fully their obligations under the existing peace agreement and note that inflammatory rhetoric is counterproductive and should cease immediately. The SPLM-IO’s withdrawal from all peace agreement monitoring and verification mechanisms undermines the peace agreement and must be immediately reversed as ceasefire monitoring bodies investigate the recent violence and seek to hold perpetrators responsible.</p>
<p>The United States calls on President Salva Kiir and First Vice President Riek Machar to do their utmost to de-escalate tensions and to uphold their respective obligations under the 2018 peace agreement, including its ceasefire provisions.  We call on both leaders to resume implementation of key, long-delayed provisions of the revitalized peace agreement, including taking the necessary steps to establish an inclusive process to draft a new constitution, to establish necessary electoral legislation and mechanisms, and to respect the freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly.  We urge regional states and institutions, namely the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, that are guarantors of the revitalized peace agreement to take swift action to lower tensions and put the peace process back on track prior to the expiration of the already extended transition period in February 2023.</p>
<p>All sides bear responsibility for the deteriorating situation.  Neither President Kiir nor First Vice President Machar have made good faith efforts to implement the provisions of the revitalized peace agreement, and both have resisted serious attempts to move South Sudan towards the peace, security, and prosperity the South Sudanese people continue to desire.  Furthermore, numerous other political leaders also fail to carry out their official responsibilities and many engage in political violence and otherwise violate the letter and spirit of the peace agreement. We call on all members of the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity to take the actions necessary to be seen as credible in the eyes of the South Sudanese people, starting with full adherence to and implementation of the 2018 peace agreement.</p>

		<title>United States Announces Additional Humanitarian Assistance at the Launch of the 2022 Joint Response Plan for the Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis in Bangladesh</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>At the launch of the 2022 Joint Response Plan for the Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis in Bangladesh, U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh Peter Haas announced more than $152 million in additional humanitarian assistance for those in Bangladesh, Burma, and elsewhere in the region affected by the Burmese military’s genocide, crimes against humanity, and ethnic cleansing against Rohingya.  With this new funding, our total assistance for this response reaches more than $1.7 billion since August 2017, when over 740,000 Rohingya were forced to flee to safety in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.  This announcement demonstrates our solidarity with Rohingya and the generous communities hosting them as well as our ongoing commitment to strengthening the international response to the Rohingya crisis and the escalating violence in Burma.</p>
<p>The humanitarian assistance includes nearly $51 million from the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) and more than $101 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  With more than $125 million for programs specifically in Bangladesh, this funding will enable our humanitarian partners to provide life-saving assistance to the over 920,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.  It also provides support to more than 540,000 affected members of the local host community in Bangladesh.  This assistance helps ensure children and young adults have access to education and vocational training, provides families with food, healthcare, access to clean water and sanitation to prevent the spread of disease, supports the protection of Rohingya refugees’ human rights and well-being, strengthens disaster preparedness, and helps combat the effects of climate change.  We commend our humanitarian partners for a strong and well-coordinated response as this crisis approaches its fifth year.</p>
<p>The United States recognizes that Bangladesh and its people have taken on an enormous responsibility in hosting refugees.  We are working with the Government of Bangladesh, Rohingya, and people within Burma toward finding solutions to this crisis, including the safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable return and reintegration of Rohingya refugees and internally displaced persons when conditions in Burma allow.  Secretary Blinken has determined that members of the Burmese military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Rohingya, and that many of those responsible for these atrocities are the same people who led the military coup in 2021 and ongoing violence across Burma.  We are relentlessly pressuring Burma’s military regime to stop its violence and return to the path of democracy.  At the same time, we also must expand education and livelihood opportunities, including cash-for-work programs and access to local markets, for Rohingya refugees in the region.  Education and income-generating activities are among the most effective methods to create safer refugee camps in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The United States remains committed to delivering aid to Rohingya, and we welcome the generous pledges made by other donors at today’s event.  However, more support is desperately needed.  We urge other donors to come forward now with additional funds to sustain and increase support for the Rakhine State/Rohingya refugee crisis and those suffering from the escalating violence perpetrated by the genocidal military in Burma today.</p>

<p>Residence of the Crown Prince</p>
<p><strong>CROWN PRINCE BIN ZAYED:  </strong>(In progress)  This is a very important opportunity, and I’m sure we have a lot to talk about, especially between our bilateral relationship.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Your Highness, I’m grateful for the time today, and actually I’m grateful for the time every day because the partnership between our countries truly matters to the United States.  The UAE is a leader in the region, increasingly a leader in the world, and the many things that we are trying to do, including for our own people around the world, are going to be much more effective if they’re doing them together with you.</p>
<p>And we have a lot of challenges, but we also have some remarkable opportunities.  We were just, as you know, in the Negev, and that in and of itself was an extraordinary moment, and it’s the product in large part of the vision and courage you and other leaders in the UAE brought to it.  Sheikh Abdullah spoke very powerfully, and eloquently, and from the heart about what this could represent, and that had a real impact, I think.</p>
<p>At the same time, we have real challenges to confront together in the region and beyond – in the region, in Yemen, the aggression being committed by the Houthis, including terrorist attacks against the UAE, against Saudi Arabia.  We’re determined to do everything we can to help you defend yourselves effectively against that.  We will be consulting on Iran, another shared challenge, the status of the talks on the JCPOA, but also the work we can do together and need to do together to strengthen our collective security.</p>
<p>And finally, we have, unfortunately, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, the impact it’s having not only in Europe but around the world, including here – food prices, energy prices, all of this.  But for all of this, I must tell you we are grateful for and committed to the partnership that we have with the UAE, and I am grateful for the time to be able to spend some time to talk to you about that today.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>CROWN PRINCE BIN ZAYED:  </strong>It’s my pleasure, sir.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Rabat, Morocco</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:</b>  (Via interpreter)  Dear Secretary of State the U.S., like to extend a warm welcome to him to Morocco.  We are all pleased and glad to meet him in our – in his – the first official state meeting of Secretary of State in the current administration to Morocco.  Welcome to you, sir.</p>
<p>As per the vision of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, the Moroccan-U.S. relations have always been longstanding and based on longstanding partnership that’s quite ambitious and developed, also grounded on personal relation between His Majesty King Mohammed VI and President Joe Biden since their meeting in Marrakesh back in 2016.</p>
<p>With Mr. Secretary of State we met yesterday in Negev, in Israel, to talk about how to support positive dynamics in the Middle East.  We are convening today also today as part of our endeavor to further strengthen our relations.  In May, we’ll convene again as part of the Global Alliance and Coalition Against ISIS and to support our joint endeavors to fight extremism and terrorism worldwide.  In June, Morocco and the U.S. will hold African Lion maneuvers.  That’s one of the major parts of our military cooperation.  In July, we will also host the Economic American-African Forum in Marrakesh.  All this testifies to the richness of our U.S. and Moroccan relations.</p>
<p>Thanks to their variety and diversity, this covers the political side, the security side, the military side, the economic side.  This is a partnership that goes back – our bilateral relations – to cover other areas like the Middle East, Africa, and other parts of the world.  Our relations are strong.  Our partnership is strong, grounded on mutual shared values, shared interests, grounded also on a shared vision around a number of international issues and regional issues.</p>
<p>His Majesty the King wants to make sure that these relations move forward as part of the tools and mechanisms that we all have.  The Strategic Dialogue and we held two weeks ago around with Lady Wendy Sherman.  Also dialogue on human rights, and we held two rounds earlier.  The FTA, that is the only U.S. agreement with an African country which has resulted in very positive outcomes in terms of developing and promoting our trade relations.  And we hope this will also play a key role in moving forward with the U.S. investments in Morocco.</p>
<p>As part of the MCC also, which has been a contribution, an important contribution to the endeavor of Morocco and also as part of tools for security and military cooperation.  This cooperation has always been strong and very productive, resulting in many initiatives between the U.S. and Morocco.  Today, we have talked around all these issues and how to further develop our mutual relation’s and bilateral relations so this partnership can be strong and modeled based on historical values, and also in line with the current ambitions and values.</p>
<p>We have talked about different challenges in Middle East, and we’d like to thank the U.S. as a party to the three-party agreement signed before His Majesty back in January – in December 2022, where Morocco has relaunched its relations with Israel.  This agreement has resulted in positive outcomes, and we can – this can also yield more fruits as part of concrete project that are beneficial to the Moroccan and Israeli peoples.  But the three-party agreement – Israel, U.S., and Morocco – is also a message and a sign for the need of a two-state solution, steady solution, in the Middle East by setting up free states which Jerusalem as a capital, living and coexisting with Israel.  And as part of the vision of His Majesty the King, Jerusalem can be a city for coexistence.</p>
<p>We have talked also about our partnership in Africa to face up to the different challenges and also to make profit of the many opportunities we have in Africa economically, in terms of trade, and also in terms of climate changes, and also in the area of trade and infrastructures, and also in terms of security and healthcare and military.  Africa is fertile land for U.S.-Moroccan cooperation.  And also the North Africa and Sahel, there are many challenge; there are many tensions that have to be addressed.  And also there are many security-related challenges that need to be addressed positively and constructively.</p>
<p>I think your visit, Tony, is very important and that has produced clear messages about this cooperation, the many possibilities we can actually profit from here to the benefit for our two countries, but also to the benefit of security and stability and development in areas that we consider to be very important to us and to you.  Once again, thank you for your visit, and you’re most welcome.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Foreign Minister, Nasser, thank you.  It’s really good to be with you once again.  It feels like it was only yesterday.</p>
<p>Indeed, we just came from the historic Negev Summit, and together with our partners from Bahrain, from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel, we discussed, as Nasser said, a wide range of areas where we can seize on normalization to make a positive impact on the lives of our people.  It’s an effort that quite simply would not have been possible were it not for the courage and vision of leaders like His Majesty King Mohammed VI to break down longstanding barriers.  And I’m committed to working with the foreign minister and all our friends here and across the region to make this vision real, translating it into more opportunities for people and further widening the circle of friendship.</p>
<p>Now, while integration among some of these countries is new, the diplomatic relationship between Morocco and the United States dates back more than 240 years, and its depth and breadth are reflected in everything we discussed today, and Nasser touched on a lot of these issues.  For more than 15 years, our free trade agreement has benefited people and companies in both of our countries and beyond.  Today, we discussed how we can continue to grow our economic cooperation in particular to benefit underserved populations.</p>
<p>For example, we’re in the fifth and final year of what is a $460 million compact administrated by the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation.  That’s provided jobs and education opportunities for young people, boosted agricultural productivity, expanded land rights for women.  The compact includes a partnership with Morocco’s Ministry of Education that is piloting a model aimed at improving secondary education in 90 secondary schools across the country, training some 6,000 teachers and administrators, making investments in the schools’ infrastructure and in its technology.</p>
<p>Just last week, our officials came together and broke ground on a major expansion of the industrial zone in Bouznika, backed by a public-private partnership, and that is expected to generate some 4,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Partners show up for each other in difficult times, and as Morocco experiences one of the worst droughts in decades, we’re doing what we can to help.  Now, I tried to do what I could to help by bringing a little rain with me today – (laughter) – but that’s clearly not enough.  We have experts from the State Department and the Department of the Interior consulting directly with their Moroccan counterparts on immediate steps to diminish the drought’s impact and to increase water conversation.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we’re hosting a conference in Casablanca that will bring together your top water management companies with some experts from the United States to focus on how this country can better produce, use, and conserve its water resources.  And going back long before this drought, we’d been working to build greater capacity in the country to try to predict, prepare for, and mitigate the worst impacts of droughts, and to train rising generations of Moroccan water management experts.  The drought’s already affected agricultural production, we know raising the cost of food.</p>
<p>Now, the natural disaster is being worsened by a manmade disaster, as the Russian Government and its brutal war in Ukraine has disrupted the supply of wheat and other commodities.  Here, across the region, we’re discussing concrete steps we can take and our partners can take to help reduce the impact of these shortages, particularly on the most vulnerable populations.  This disruption is another reason we’ll continue to urge our friends and partners to speak out with one voice in condemning the Russian Government’s aggression – the consequences of which are being felt around the world – and hold the Kremlin accountable for as long as this continues.</p>
<p>The increasing frequency and severity of droughts and other extreme weather here, in the United States, around the world also underscores the urgency of our collective efforts to address the climate crisis.  And in this, Morocco is a world leader, setting an ambitious target of achieving 63 percent renewable energy by 2035.  With 45 percent of the country’s electricity production already coming from renewables, Morocco is on track to meet this ambitious target and even exceed it.  Morocco also signed the Global Methane Pledge at COP26, and at COP22, the kingdom founded three African-wide commissions – the Congo Basin Commission, the Sahel Commission, the Small Island Nations Commission – and continues to lead climate finance and feasibility studies for all three of them.</p>
<p>We’ve also worked side by side in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.  We’ve been able to donate more than 2.5 million safe, effective vaccines to Morocco through the COVAX Initiative over the last several months alone.  And since the outset of the pandemic, we’ve been working closely with the Moroccan Ministry of Health and other partners to train health workers, provide PPE and essential lab equipment, and enhance Morocco’s vaccine cold chain, all of which has helped contribute to a very effective response, led by His Majesty, to COVID here in Morocco.  And Morocco is also now contributing to the efforts that other countries are making, something we greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>We launched a $3 million partnership with the Pasteur Institute of Morocco to strengthen global health security capacity so that we can prepare for, respond to, and deal with infectious disease in the future.  We support King Mohammed VI’s ambitious reform agenda to strengthen Morocco’s institutions and ensure government is responsive to the Moroccan people.  The United States is committed to working with Morocco to make concrete progress in key areas, advancing the right to freedom of expression and association, criminal justice reforms, women’s rights and gender equality, government transparency, which the foreign minister and I had an opportunity to discuss today.</p>
<p>We also discussed security.  The United States recognizes the important role that Morocco plays in maintaining regional security and stability, as well as its contribution to peace and prosperity in the region.  We’re collaborating closely on addressing regional issues like the Sahel and Libya, the fight against terrorism, where Morocco has demonstrated sustained leadership to the Global Counterterrorism Forum and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  We very much support the work of the United Nations Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General Stefan de Mistura in leading the political process for Western Sahara, under the auspices of the United Nations, to promote a peaceful and prosperous future for the people of Western Sahara and the region.  And we appreciate Morocco’s support for this mission.  We continue to view Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as serious, credible, and realistic, and one potential approach to meet the aspirations of the people of Western Sahara.</p>
<p>Let me just conclude by wishing an early <i>Ramadan Kareem</i> to the people of Morocco and around the world who will celebrate the holy month starting in just a few days.  And I wish our Moroccan friends – I shouldn’t say this – I’m going to wish you good luck in the World Cup qualifying match.  That’s not fair to the other side.  If we wish both sides good luck, it will wind up in a tie, but that’s good for Morocco.</p>
<p>So Nasser, thank you for hosting us.  Thank you for your leadership.  Thank you for your friendship.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>(In Arabic.)</p>
<p>Now, questions for the press.  We’ll take the first one from Fadwa Mrabti, Al Ghad TV.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Via interpreter)  Good afternoon.  Fadwa Mrabti from Al Ghad channel.  His Majesty Mohammed VI is president of Al-Quds Committee, and Morocco has been playing historical roles in terms of Palestinian cause today after resuming relations with Israel.  How does the U.S. administration see the role that Morocco can play in moving forward with the negotiations with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, especially that Morocco hangs on to its position of two-state solution and the right of the Palestinians to have a free, independent state with Jerusalem as its capital?  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>First, I was just in Israel before the meeting that we had together in the Negev.  I was in Jerusalem and also in Ramallah.  And one of the points that I made in both Jerusalem with Israeli counterparts, in Ramallah with President Abbas, is of course the United States continued, ongoing support for a two-state solution, an outcome that would meet the aspirations of the Palestinian people and their entitlement to a state of their own, as well as, of course, ensuring the security of Israel and its strength as a Jewish and democratic state.</p>
<p>The normalization agreements and the work that Morocco and other countries are doing with Israel is not a substitute for this outcome, for two states.  But it can, I believe, reinforce it.  In our discussions yesterday in the Negev, all of the partners in this enterprise, including Morocco, including the United States, talked about the need to advance that prospect and that horizon, but in the meantime to do concrete things to help improve the lives of Palestinians.  And this is exactly one of the things that the work we’re doing through the partnership that now exists among the countries that participated in the Negev Summit, that’s exactly one of the things that we’re focused on.  And we were talking in very concrete ways about initiatives that we can undertake together to improve the lives of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think that Morocco’s growing relationship with Israel, as well as that of other countries, will further strengthen its voice, as well as their own voice, in trying to advance the prospect of two states and improving the lives of Palestinians day in, day out.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>   Our first question will go to Conor Finnegan, ABC News.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you.  Mr. Foreign Minister, on the Abraham Accords, the previous U.S. administration had pledged to open a consulate in Western Sahara, and yet this administration has so far not taken any steps to follow through on that.  Are you concerned that the U.S. will not meet that commitment?  And when you reference the Negev Summit, can you be more specific?  What kinds of concrete steps is Morocco willing to take to deepen ties with Israel?</p>
<p>And Mr. Secretary, Russian and Ukrainian delegations met today in Turkey.  You have been skeptical of talks with Russia so far during this war, but both sides are now openly discussing the potential terms of an agreement.  So yes or no – do you believe that Russia is now engaging in genuine dialogue?  The Ukrainian side has also said that any agreement must involve security guarantees by third countries.  Will the U.S. get involved in talks, including by providing security guarantees?  And the Ukrainian foreign minister specifically warned today to his delegation before the meetings to not eat, drink, or touch anything during the talks.  Do you have any comment on the recent reports of a potential poisoning, and do you have any concern for the negotiators’ safety?  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:</b>  (Via interpreter)  With regard to the first part of your question, obviously, the three-party agreement is definitely an important document that’s created dynamics in terms of relations with Israel but also in terms of promoting relations in different aspects with the U.S.  Morocco is definitely confident that Moroccan and U.S. relations are strong – tense, but moving forward in the right direction.  We are fully confident that all aspects pertaining to the three-party agreement signed in December 2020 can be applicable as part of agreements and also as part of the timing that different parties deem relevant and appropriate.</p>
<p>But the position of the U.S. with regard to the autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is firm and stable under different administrations, and we have heard that again today.  Autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the only solution supported by the U.S. and by other countries, and you have also seen recently Spain and Germany joining and other African and Arab countries.  They all go along the same direction.  So we are all fully confident that their positions are moving forward, are continuing, and the implementation of that hedges on different constellations that we can perhaps talk about between us directly.</p>
<p>Now regarding the second part of your question, the Moroccan and Israel relations are very special.  From – based on the long and strong relations between the kings of Morocco and the Moroccan Jewish people that’s considered a big chunk of the Israeli population.  This is part that in – this is a part that enriches this relation.  Since the signing of the three-party agreement, a number of things have happened since then in terms of visits, agreements, direct airlines, and also different delegations coming in, and also visits of different officials.</p>
<p>The next step, as Antony said, should go directly to concrete projects that businesspeople can feel, that citizens can feel and see in both countries.  This – His Majesty talked about a choice based on conviction, its natural choice.  This natural choice based on conviction should also be strengthened and fortified by concrete projects, by projects visible to the citizens in agriculture, in use of water, in security, stability, and so on and so forth.  So this is what can actually give this relation more strength.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, we saw visit of Moroccan businesspeople to Israel where they had direct meetings with their counterparts, so how can we invest in this economic field so we can sign more agreements on the Qualified Industrial Zones?  This can be a three-party – three-party cooperation area for different parties to generate more opportunities and development for everybody.  So this relationship has been moving forward, has been moving forward with still a lot of opportunities in the future.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Conor, thank you.  First on the talks, I would leave it to our Ukrainian partners to characterize whether there is any genuine progress and whether Russia is engaging meaningfully.</p>
<p>What I can say is this:  There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does.  We’re focused on the latter, and what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people, and that continues as we speak.  As a result of this aggression committed by Russia, as I mentioned the other day, fully half of the children in Ukraine have been displaced from their homes – half of the children.  And, of course, we’ve seen what is going on in Mariupol, among other places.</p>
<p>So we’re focused on what Russia does.  And what it should do is end the aggression now, stop firing, pull its forces back, and, of course, engage in talks.  The fact that the Ukrainians are – have the extraordinary courage and willingness and determination not only to stand up for their country and their futures, but to engage in these talks with a gun literally to their head, I think speaks volumes.  But I would look to them to characterize whether there’s any – anything meaningfully coming.</p>
<p>If there is some kind of outcome, and if our support for Ukraine can be part of that outcome –including our support in the future for its defense and security – of course that’s something we’ll want to pursue.  But again, from what I’ve – I have not seen anything that suggests that this is moving forward in an effective way, because Russia – at least we have not seen signs of real seriousness, but if Ukraine concludes that there is, that’s good and we support that.</p>
<p>As to the stories about the poisoning, I don’t have any details on that.  I’ve seen the reports. What I can say is that, of course, this raises concerns because Russia has a real track record, and you only have to go as far back as the poisonings in the UK, Navalny, and others to see why concerns would certainly be understandable.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>(Via interpreter)  Shakir Allaoui, 360.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Via interpreter)  My question is for the two ministers.  The United Kingdom is organizing in Marrakesh a summit for Africa.  How could Morocco become a platform to further develop this relationship with African countries?</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:  </b>(Via interpreter)  As I said, our relations have regional ramifications.  What you are doing in our bilateral relations is productive and beneficial to our two countries, to our two peoples, our two economies.  But this also got other repercussions regionally.</p>
<p>In terms of the economic effects, you know how much His Majesty hands-on to Africa to achieve stability there and development.  Africa is not a burden now for the international community; it’s an opportunity for the international community.  There are many opportunities and big potentials in Africa.  Africa has proven even during COVID some kind of resilience before the economic effects of the pandemic.  Africa – its clout lies in its young population.  It is the only part of the world where you have 30 million individuals that on annual basis join the middle class.  This is unprecedented.  This is not seen in other parts of the world.  This by itself, in itself, an economic potential.</p>
<p>Africa has got a lot of potential of infrastructures, renewable resources, technologies, and so on and so forth.  Africa is an opportunity.  That’s why Morocco has developed its relations thank to the vision – with Africa thanks to the vision of His Majesty the king.  Morocco is heavily present in Africa.  It’s the second investor – African investor in Africa.  So how can we cooperate with our American partners?  We are the only ones having an FTA with the U.S. in Africa.  Africa now is creating (inaudible) free trade agreement in Africa.  So how can we use our bilateral FTA as a platform to get to Africa jointly?  We have a joint vision on development and stability and prosperity in Africa.  So how can the U.S. (inaudible) from Morocco or based on a partnership with Morocco can actually expand into Africa, especially in its western part and central part?</p>
<p>All these are potentials that we need to talk about within the (inaudible) to be held in July.</p>
<p>This is the vocation for Morocco, to be a bridge between partners and Africa.  That’s what we’re going to do in this economic forum in July.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you.  I think Nasser said it extremely well, and I would add simply that I think the – and we had a long conversation about this actually just today, about how we can work together more effectively in Africa, building on what we’re already doing.  We already have a strong security partnership when it comes to dealing with security challenges in Africa, but we want to make sure as well that we are dealing with some of the challenges that are also opportunities in building stronger global health, including in Africa, in addressing the climate challenge.</p>
<p>And again, Morocco is a leader on this, but we can bring some of that leadership and expertise together in Africa in pursuing infrastructure projects and in creating opportunities for young people throughout the continent.  These are all the kinds of things that we’ll be talking about in a couple of months, but we already talked about today.</p>
<p>But I think it’s evidence of something very powerful in this relationship.  We have a strong bilateral relationship.  We work on many things directly together in the interests of both our people.  We also have a strong regional partnership that you see translated in the work that we’re doing throughout the region.  But increasingly as well, it’s truly global, because when we’re working together on things like dealing with pandemics or dealing with climate change, these are of global consequence.</p>
<p>And as a result, Morocco is really and truly a partner on the global stage for us.  It’s a partnership we value deeply, and this is exactly why we’ve spent so much time today talking about how to deepen it, how to pursue it not only between ourselves, but in different parts of the world, and notably, Africa.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  Our second question goes to Humeyra Pamuk of Reuters.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you.  Hello, Mr. Secretary, Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary, just to quickly follow up on Ukraine, Russian deputy defense minister said Moscow has decided to fundamentally cut back military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv.  Do you see this statement as a major shift in Russia’s invasion?  Has the United States over the last few days observed Russia shift its military focus from Kyiv to Donbas?</p>
<p>And separately, you will meet with Abu Dhabi crown prince later today.  It is no secret that the relationship with the UAE as well as Saudi Arabia is at a difficult place.  They snub America’s calls to increase oil production.  They’ve done little to help Ukraine.  What concrete ideas are you bringing to this meeting to put the relationship back on track, and are you hopeful that it will?</p>
<p>Mr. Foreign Minister, very quickly, earlier this month, Spain said it was backing Morocco’s autonomy proposals for Western Sahara.  Do you see any other EU states following suit?  And also, your country, along with several others in the Middle East, haven’t been very vocal for its support of Ukraine.  You haven’t showed up in the United Nations vote either.  Why aren’t you more critical of Russia?  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you, Humeyra.  Two things.  First, with regard to the statements that &#8212;</p>
<p><b>PARTICIPANT:</b>  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I’m sorry, what did we miss?  No?</p>
<p>With regard to the statements on Russia’s aggression, I come back to what I said a few minutes ago, which is that we’re focused on what they do, not on what they say.  And so I can’t tell you whether these statements reflect some reorientation of the aggression to focus only on – “only,” in quotation marks, eastern and southern Ukraine, or whether this is a means by which Russia once again is trying to deflect and deceive people into thinking it’s doing – it’s not doing what it is doing, whether it’s simply trying to regroup, given the heavy losses that it’s suffered.  I don’t know.  So we’re focused on what they do.</p>
<p>I would add that if they somehow believe that an effort to subjugate “only,” in quotation marks, the eastern part of Ukraine or – and the southern part of Ukraine can succeed, then once again, they are profoundly fooling themselves.  They’re – we’ve seen the will and the determination of the Ukrainian people to determine their own future, not to have Russia or anyone else determine it for them.  And so I think that will would continue to be expressed one way or another in all parts of the country.</p>
<p>With regard to my meeting later today with the crown prince, it’s fortuitous that we have this opportunity to take advantage of our presence here to spend some time together.  I’m very much looking forward to it.  We’ll have an opportunity to have a truly strategic conversation about the full range of issues that we’re working on together, regionally, globally.</p>
<p>And I’ll have more to say, no doubt, about that tomorrow, but this is an important strategic relationship and partnership for the United States.  I’m really pleased to have the chance to sit down with him.  I was with the foreign minister for the last more than 24 hours in the Negev.  We had an opportunity to spend some time together, and of course we’re working very closely together not only in the context of the Negev Summit, but on so many other issues.</p>
<p>So more to say about that tomorrow, but I’m looking forward to it.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:</b>  On the first question on Spain, of course, the letter of the prime minister of Spain to His Majesty expressing support to the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as the basis for any solution to the Sahara issue is a very positive development.  And we reacted and we welcome that – this development, and we consider that it is – as His Majesty said, it will open a new chapter in our bilateral relations.</p>
<p>The position of Spain is not an isolated one.  There is a dynamic at the international level in support of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as a serious, credible outcome for this regional dispute.  This is the position of the United States, this is the position of Germany, this is the position of France, this is the position of the Arab countries, this is the position of the African countries, and others.  So that’s why we think it’s time for Europe mainly – and I said that before – to get out of this comfort zone where we – people are just supporting the process.  And supporting a process doesn’t mean supporting a solution.  You can be comfortable in saying yes, we support a process, and this process could last for decades.  What is important now and why there is this dynamic – and de Mistura is also part of this dynamic – is how to shift into an outcome-oriented effort.</p>
<p>And in this regard, in different areas of the world, there is a consensus that this solution should be within Moroccan sovereignty and within the Moroccan Autonomy Plan.  And we hope that other countries will follow to get out of this comfort zone and to be actor in finding a solution instead of being passive in supporting the status quo.</p>
<p>On Ukraine, Moroccan position is very clear and it has been expressed many times.  We are in favor of territorial integrity and national unity of Ukraine, as of all the member states of the United Nations.  We are against the use or the recourse to force in settling disputes.  We are in favor of constructive neighborhood relations, and we are in favor of dialogue and negotiation to solve issues.  This has been our position.  It is clear and it is in line with the UN Charter.  It is in line with the principles of international law in which we believe.</p>
<p>So this position has been expressed, and we had today the opportunity to discuss more details about that.  Thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Rabat, Morocco</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:</b>  (Via interpreter)  Dear Secretary of State the U.S., like to extend a warm welcome to him to Morocco.  We are all pleased and glad to meet him in our – in his – the first official state meeting of Secretary of State in the current administration to Morocco.  Welcome to you, sir.</p>
<p>As per the vision of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, the Moroccan-U.S. relations have always been longstanding and based on longstanding partnership that’s quite ambitious and developed, also grounded on personal relation between His Majesty King Mohammed VI and President Joe Biden since their meeting in Marrakesh back in 2016.</p>
<p>With Mr. Secretary of State we met yesterday in Negev, in Israel, to talk about how to support positive dynamics in the Middle East.  We are convening today also today as part of our endeavor to further strengthen our relations.  In May, we’ll convene again as part of the Global Alliance and Coalition Against ISIS and to support our joint endeavors to fight extremism and terrorism worldwide.  In June, Morocco and the U.S. will hold African Lion maneuvers.  That’s one of the major parts of our military cooperation.  In July, we will also host the Economic American-African Forum in Marrakesh.  All this testifies to the richness of our U.S. and Moroccan relations.</p>
<p>Thanks to their variety and diversity, this covers the political side, the security side, the military side, the economic side.  This is a partnership that goes back – our bilateral relations – to cover other areas like the Middle East, Africa, and other parts of the world.  Our relations are strong.  Our partnership is strong, grounded on mutual shared values, shared interests, grounded also on a shared vision around a number of international issues and regional issues.</p>
<p>His Majesty the King wants to make sure that these relations move forward as part of the tools and mechanisms that we all have.  The Strategic Dialogue and we held two weeks ago around with Lady Wendy Sherman.  Also dialogue on human rights, and we held two rounds earlier.  The FTA, that is the only U.S. agreement with an African country which has resulted in very positive outcomes in terms of developing and promoting our trade relations.  And we hope this will also play a key role in moving forward with the U.S. investments in Morocco.</p>
<p>As part of the MCC also, which has been a contribution, an important contribution to the endeavor of Morocco and also as part of tools for security and military cooperation.  This cooperation has always been strong and very productive, resulting in many initiatives between the U.S. and Morocco.  Today, we have talked around all these issues and how to further develop our mutual relation’s and bilateral relations so this partnership can be strong and modeled based on historical values, and also in line with the current ambitions and values.</p>
<p>We have talked about different challenges in Middle East, and we’d like to thank the U.S. as a party to the three-party agreement signed before His Majesty back in January – in December 2022, where Morocco has relaunched its relations with Israel.  This agreement has resulted in positive outcomes, and we can – this can also yield more fruits as part of concrete project that are beneficial to the Moroccan and Israeli peoples.  But the three-party agreement – Israel, U.S., and Morocco – is also a message and a sign for the need of a two-state solution, steady solution, in the Middle East by setting up free states which Jerusalem as a capital, living and coexisting with Israel.  And as part of the vision of His Majesty the King, Jerusalem can be a city for coexistence.</p>
<p>We have talked also about our partnership in Africa to face up to the different challenges and also to make profit of the many opportunities we have in Africa economically, in terms of trade, and also in terms of climate changes, and also in the area of trade and infrastructures, and also in terms of security and healthcare and military.  Africa is fertile land for U.S.-Moroccan cooperation.  And also the North Africa and Sahel, there are many challenge; there are many tensions that have to be addressed.  And also there are many security-related challenges that need to be addressed positively and constructively.</p>
<p>I think your visit, Tony, is very important and that has produced clear messages about this cooperation, the many possibilities we can actually profit from here to the benefit for our two countries, but also to the benefit of security and stability and development in areas that we consider to be very important to us and to you.  Once again, thank you for your visit, and you’re most welcome.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Foreign Minister, Nasser, thank you.  It’s really good to be with you once again.  It feels like it was only yesterday.</p>
<p>Indeed, we just came from the historic Negev Summit, and together with our partners from Bahrain, from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel, we discussed, as Nasser said, a wide range of areas where we can seize on normalization to make a positive impact on the lives of our people.  It’s an effort that quite simply would not have been possible were it not for the courage and vision of leaders like His Majesty King Mohammed VI to break down longstanding barriers.  And I’m committed to working with the foreign minister and all our friends here and across the region to make this vision real, translating it into more opportunities for people and further widening the circle of friendship.</p>
<p>Now, while integration among some of these countries is new, the diplomatic relationship between Morocco and the United States dates back more than 240 years, and its depth and breadth are reflected in everything we discussed today, and Nasser touched on a lot of these issues.  For more than 15 years, our free trade agreement has benefited people and companies in both of our countries and beyond.  Today, we discussed how we can continue to grow our economic cooperation in particular to benefit underserved populations.</p>
<p>For example, we’re in the fifth and final year of what is a $460 million compact administrated by the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation.  That’s provided jobs and education opportunities for young people, boosted agricultural productivity, expanded land rights for women.  The compact includes a partnership with Morocco’s Ministry of Education that is piloting a model aimed at improving secondary education in 90 secondary schools across the country, training some 6,000 teachers and administrators, making investments in the schools’ infrastructure and in its technology.</p>
<p>Just last week, our officials came together and broke ground on a major expansion of the industrial zone in Bouznika, backed by a public-private partnership, and that is expected to generate some 4,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Partners show up for each other in difficult times, and as Morocco experiences one of the worst droughts in decades, we’re doing what we can to help.  Now, I tried to do what I could to help by bringing a little rain with me today – (laughter) – but that’s clearly not enough.  We have experts from the State Department and the Department of the Interior consulting directly with their Moroccan counterparts on immediate steps to diminish the drought’s impact and to increase water conversation.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we’re hosting a conference in Casablanca that will bring together your top water management companies with some experts from the United States to focus on how this country can better produce, use, and conserve its water resources.  And going back long before this drought, we’d been working to build greater capacity in the country to try to predict, prepare for, and mitigate the worst impacts of droughts, and to train rising generations of Moroccan water management experts.  The drought’s already affected agricultural production, we know raising the cost of food.</p>
<p>Now, the natural disaster is being worsened by a manmade disaster, as the Russian Government and its brutal war in Ukraine has disrupted the supply of wheat and other commodities.  Here, across the region, we’re discussing concrete steps we can take and our partners can take to help reduce the impact of these shortages, particularly on the most vulnerable populations.  This disruption is another reason we’ll continue to urge our friends and partners to speak out with one voice in condemning the Russian Government’s aggression – the consequences of which are being felt around the world – and hold the Kremlin accountable for as long as this continues.</p>
<p>The increasing frequency and severity of droughts and other extreme weather here, in the United States, around the world also underscores the urgency of our collective efforts to address the climate crisis.  And in this, Morocco is a world leader, setting an ambitious target of achieving 63 percent renewable energy by 2035.  With 45 percent of the country’s electricity production already coming from renewables, Morocco is on track to meet this ambitious target and even exceed it.  Morocco also signed the Global Methane Pledge at COP26, and at COP22, the kingdom founded three African-wide commissions – the Congo Basin Commission, the Sahel Commission, the Small Island Nations Commission – and continues to lead climate finance and feasibility studies for all three of them.</p>
<p>We’ve also worked side by side in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.  We’ve been able to donate more than 2.5 million safe, effective vaccines to Morocco through the COVAX Initiative over the last several months alone.  And since the outset of the pandemic, we’ve been working closely with the Moroccan Ministry of Health and other partners to train health workers, provide PPE and essential lab equipment, and enhance Morocco’s vaccine cold chain, all of which has helped contribute to a very effective response, led by His Majesty, to COVID here in Morocco.  And Morocco is also now contributing to the efforts that other countries are making, something we greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>We launched a $3 million partnership with the Pasteur Institute of Morocco to strengthen global health security capacity so that we can prepare for, respond to, and deal with infectious disease in the future.  We support King Mohammed VI’s ambitious reform agenda to strengthen Morocco’s institutions and ensure government is responsive to the Moroccan people.  The United States is committed to working with Morocco to make concrete progress in key areas, advancing the right to freedom of expression and association, criminal justice reforms, women’s rights and gender equality, government transparency, which the foreign minister and I had an opportunity to discuss today.</p>
<p>We also discussed security.  The United States recognizes the important role that Morocco plays in maintaining regional security and stability, as well as its contribution to peace and prosperity in the region.  We’re collaborating closely on addressing regional issues like the Sahel and Libya, the fight against terrorism, where Morocco has demonstrated sustained leadership to the Global Counterterrorism Forum and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  We very much support the work of the United Nations Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General Stefan de Mistura in leading the political process for Western Sahara, under the auspices of the United Nations, to promote a peaceful and prosperous future for the people of Western Sahara and the region.  And we appreciate Morocco’s support for this mission.  We continue to view Morocco’s Autonomy Plan as serious, credible, and realistic, and one potential approach to meet the aspirations of the people of Western Sahara.</p>
<p>Let me just conclude by wishing an early <i>Ramadan Kareem</i> to the people of Morocco and around the world who will celebrate the holy month starting in just a few days.  And I wish our Moroccan friends – I shouldn’t say this – I’m going to wish you good luck in the World Cup qualifying match.  That’s not fair to the other side.  If we wish both sides good luck, it will wind up in a tie, but that’s good for Morocco.</p>
<p>So Nasser, thank you for hosting us.  Thank you for your leadership.  Thank you for your friendship.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>(In Arabic.)</p>
<p>Now, questions for the press.  We’ll take the first one from Fadwa Mrabti, Al Ghad TV.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Via interpreter)  Good afternoon.  Fadwa Mrabti from Al Ghad channel.  His Majesty Mohammed VI is president of Al-Quds Committee, and Morocco has been playing historical roles in terms of Palestinian cause today after resuming relations with Israel.  How does the U.S. administration see the role that Morocco can play in moving forward with the negotiations with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, especially that Morocco hangs on to its position of two-state solution and the right of the Palestinians to have a free, independent state with Jerusalem as its capital?  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>First, I was just in Israel before the meeting that we had together in the Negev.  I was in Jerusalem and also in Ramallah.  And one of the points that I made in both Jerusalem with Israeli counterparts, in Ramallah with President Abbas, is of course the United States continued, ongoing support for a two-state solution, an outcome that would meet the aspirations of the Palestinian people and their entitlement to a state of their own, as well as, of course, ensuring the security of Israel and its strength as a Jewish and democratic state.</p>
<p>The normalization agreements and the work that Morocco and other countries are doing with Israel is not a substitute for this outcome, for two states.  But it can, I believe, reinforce it.  In our discussions yesterday in the Negev, all of the partners in this enterprise, including Morocco, including the United States, talked about the need to advance that prospect and that horizon, but in the meantime to do concrete things to help improve the lives of Palestinians.  And this is exactly one of the things that the work we’re doing through the partnership that now exists among the countries that participated in the Negev Summit, that’s exactly one of the things that we’re focused on.  And we were talking in very concrete ways about initiatives that we can undertake together to improve the lives of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think that Morocco’s growing relationship with Israel, as well as that of other countries, will further strengthen its voice, as well as their own voice, in trying to advance the prospect of two states and improving the lives of Palestinians day in, day out.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>   Our first question will go to Conor Finnegan, ABC News.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you.  Mr. Foreign Minister, on the Abraham Accords, the previous U.S. administration had pledged to open a consulate in Western Sahara, and yet this administration has so far not taken any steps to follow through on that.  Are you concerned that the U.S. will not meet that commitment?  And when you reference the Negev Summit, can you be more specific?  What kinds of concrete steps is Morocco willing to take to deepen ties with Israel?</p>
<p>And Mr. Secretary, Russian and Ukrainian delegations met today in Turkey.  You have been skeptical of talks with Russia so far during this war, but both sides are now openly discussing the potential terms of an agreement.  So yes or no – do you believe that Russia is now engaging in genuine dialogue?  The Ukrainian side has also said that any agreement must involve security guarantees by third countries.  Will the U.S. get involved in talks, including by providing security guarantees?  And the Ukrainian foreign minister specifically warned today to his delegation before the meetings to not eat, drink, or touch anything during the talks.  Do you have any comment on the recent reports of a potential poisoning, and do you have any concern for the negotiators’ safety?  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:</b>  (Via interpreter)  With regard to the first part of your question, obviously, the three-party agreement is definitely an important document that’s created dynamics in terms of relations with Israel but also in terms of promoting relations in different aspects with the U.S.  Morocco is definitely confident that Moroccan and U.S. relations are strong – tense, but moving forward in the right direction.  We are fully confident that all aspects pertaining to the three-party agreement signed in December 2020 can be applicable as part of agreements and also as part of the timing that different parties deem relevant and appropriate.</p>
<p>But the position of the U.S. with regard to the autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is firm and stable under different administrations, and we have heard that again today.  Autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the only solution supported by the U.S. and by other countries, and you have also seen recently Spain and Germany joining and other African and Arab countries.  They all go along the same direction.  So we are all fully confident that their positions are moving forward, are continuing, and the implementation of that hedges on different constellations that we can perhaps talk about between us directly.</p>
<p>Now regarding the second part of your question, the Moroccan and Israel relations are very special.  From – based on the long and strong relations between the kings of Morocco and the Moroccan Jewish people that’s considered a big chunk of the Israeli population.  This is part that in – this is a part that enriches this relation.  Since the signing of the three-party agreement, a number of things have happened since then in terms of visits, agreements, direct airlines, and also different delegations coming in, and also visits of different officials.</p>
<p>The next step, as Antony said, should go directly to concrete projects that businesspeople can feel, that citizens can feel and see in both countries.  This – His Majesty talked about a choice based on conviction, its natural choice.  This natural choice based on conviction should also be strengthened and fortified by concrete projects, by projects visible to the citizens in agriculture, in use of water, in security, stability, and so on and so forth.  So this is what can actually give this relation more strength.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, we saw visit of Moroccan businesspeople to Israel where they had direct meetings with their counterparts, so how can we invest in this economic field so we can sign more agreements on the Qualified Industrial Zones?  This can be a three-party – three-party cooperation area for different parties to generate more opportunities and development for everybody.  So this relationship has been moving forward, has been moving forward with still a lot of opportunities in the future.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Conor, thank you.  First on the talks, I would leave it to our Ukrainian partners to characterize whether there is any genuine progress and whether Russia is engaging meaningfully.</p>
<p>What I can say is this:  There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does.  We’re focused on the latter, and what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people, and that continues as we speak.  As a result of this aggression committed by Russia, as I mentioned the other day, fully half of the children in Ukraine have been displaced from their homes – half of the children.  And, of course, we’ve seen what is going on in Mariupol, among other places.</p>
<p>So we’re focused on what Russia does.  And what it should do is end the aggression now, stop firing, pull its forces back, and, of course, engage in talks.  The fact that the Ukrainians are – have the extraordinary courage and willingness and determination not only to stand up for their country and their futures, but to engage in these talks with a gun literally to their head, I think speaks volumes.  But I would look to them to characterize whether there’s any – anything meaningfully coming.</p>
<p>If there is some kind of outcome, and if our support for Ukraine can be part of that outcome –including our support in the future for its defense and security – of course that’s something we’ll want to pursue.  But again, from what I’ve – I have not seen anything that suggests that this is moving forward in an effective way, because Russia – at least we have not seen signs of real seriousness, but if Ukraine concludes that there is, that’s good and we support that.</p>
<p>As to the stories about the poisoning, I don’t have any details on that.  I’ve seen the reports. What I can say is that, of course, this raises concerns because Russia has a real track record, and you only have to go as far back as the poisonings in the UK, Navalny, and others to see why concerns would certainly be understandable.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>(Via interpreter)  Shakir Allaoui, 360.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Via interpreter)  My question is for the two ministers.  The United Kingdom is organizing in Marrakesh a summit for Africa.  How could Morocco become a platform to further develop this relationship with African countries?</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:  </b>(Via interpreter)  As I said, our relations have regional ramifications.  What you are doing in our bilateral relations is productive and beneficial to our two countries, to our two peoples, our two economies.  But this also got other repercussions regionally.</p>
<p>In terms of the economic effects, you know how much His Majesty hands-on to Africa to achieve stability there and development.  Africa is not a burden now for the international community; it’s an opportunity for the international community.  There are many opportunities and big potentials in Africa.  Africa has proven even during COVID some kind of resilience before the economic effects of the pandemic.  Africa – its clout lies in its young population.  It is the only part of the world where you have 30 million individuals that on annual basis join the middle class.  This is unprecedented.  This is not seen in other parts of the world.  This by itself, in itself, an economic potential.</p>
<p>Africa has got a lot of potential of infrastructures, renewable resources, technologies, and so on and so forth.  Africa is an opportunity.  That’s why Morocco has developed its relations thank to the vision – with Africa thanks to the vision of His Majesty the king.  Morocco is heavily present in Africa.  It’s the second investor – African investor in Africa.  So how can we cooperate with our American partners?  We are the only ones having an FTA with the U.S. in Africa.  Africa now is creating (inaudible) free trade agreement in Africa.  So how can we use our bilateral FTA as a platform to get to Africa jointly?  We have a joint vision on development and stability and prosperity in Africa.  So how can the U.S. (inaudible) from Morocco or based on a partnership with Morocco can actually expand into Africa, especially in its western part and central part?</p>
<p>All these are potentials that we need to talk about within the (inaudible) to be held in July.</p>
<p>This is the vocation for Morocco, to be a bridge between partners and Africa.  That’s what we’re going to do in this economic forum in July.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you.  I think Nasser said it extremely well, and I would add simply that I think the – and we had a long conversation about this actually just today, about how we can work together more effectively in Africa, building on what we’re already doing.  We already have a strong security partnership when it comes to dealing with security challenges in Africa, but we want to make sure as well that we are dealing with some of the challenges that are also opportunities in building stronger global health, including in Africa, in addressing the climate challenge.</p>
<p>And again, Morocco is a leader on this, but we can bring some of that leadership and expertise together in Africa in pursuing infrastructure projects and in creating opportunities for young people throughout the continent.  These are all the kinds of things that we’ll be talking about in a couple of months, but we already talked about today.</p>
<p>But I think it’s evidence of something very powerful in this relationship.  We have a strong bilateral relationship.  We work on many things directly together in the interests of both our people.  We also have a strong regional partnership that you see translated in the work that we’re doing throughout the region.  But increasingly as well, it’s truly global, because when we’re working together on things like dealing with pandemics or dealing with climate change, these are of global consequence.</p>
<p>And as a result, Morocco is really and truly a partner on the global stage for us.  It’s a partnership we value deeply, and this is exactly why we’ve spent so much time today talking about how to deepen it, how to pursue it not only between ourselves, but in different parts of the world, and notably, Africa.</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  Our second question goes to Humeyra Pamuk of Reuters.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Thank you.  Hello, Mr. Secretary, Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary, just to quickly follow up on Ukraine, Russian deputy defense minister said Moscow has decided to fundamentally cut back military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv.  Do you see this statement as a major shift in Russia’s invasion?  Has the United States over the last few days observed Russia shift its military focus from Kyiv to Donbas?</p>
<p>And separately, you will meet with Abu Dhabi crown prince later today.  It is no secret that the relationship with the UAE as well as Saudi Arabia is at a difficult place.  They snub America’s calls to increase oil production.  They’ve done little to help Ukraine.  What concrete ideas are you bringing to this meeting to put the relationship back on track, and are you hopeful that it will?</p>
<p>Mr. Foreign Minister, very quickly, earlier this month, Spain said it was backing Morocco’s autonomy proposals for Western Sahara.  Do you see any other EU states following suit?  And also, your country, along with several others in the Middle East, haven’t been very vocal for its support of Ukraine.  You haven’t showed up in the United Nations vote either.  Why aren’t you more critical of Russia?  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you, Humeyra.  Two things.  First, with regard to the statements that &#8212;</p>
<p><b>PARTICIPANT:</b>  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I’m sorry, what did we miss?  No?</p>
<p>With regard to the statements on Russia’s aggression, I come back to what I said a few minutes ago, which is that we’re focused on what they do, not on what they say.  And so I can’t tell you whether these statements reflect some reorientation of the aggression to focus only on – “only,” in quotation marks, eastern and southern Ukraine, or whether this is a means by which Russia once again is trying to deflect and deceive people into thinking it’s doing – it’s not doing what it is doing, whether it’s simply trying to regroup, given the heavy losses that it’s suffered.  I don’t know.  So we’re focused on what they do.</p>
<p>I would add that if they somehow believe that an effort to subjugate “only,” in quotation marks, the eastern part of Ukraine or – and the southern part of Ukraine can succeed, then once again, they are profoundly fooling themselves.  They’re – we’ve seen the will and the determination of the Ukrainian people to determine their own future, not to have Russia or anyone else determine it for them.  And so I think that will would continue to be expressed one way or another in all parts of the country.</p>
<p>With regard to my meeting later today with the crown prince, it’s fortuitous that we have this opportunity to take advantage of our presence here to spend some time together.  I’m very much looking forward to it.  We’ll have an opportunity to have a truly strategic conversation about the full range of issues that we’re working on together, regionally, globally.</p>
<p>And I’ll have more to say, no doubt, about that tomorrow, but this is an important strategic relationship and partnership for the United States.  I’m really pleased to have the chance to sit down with him.  I was with the foreign minister for the last more than 24 hours in the Negev.  We had an opportunity to spend some time together, and of course we’re working very closely together not only in the context of the Negev Summit, but on so many other issues.</p>
<p>So more to say about that tomorrow, but I’m looking forward to it.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER BOURITA:</b>  On the first question on Spain, of course, the letter of the prime minister of Spain to His Majesty expressing support to the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as the basis for any solution to the Sahara issue is a very positive development.  And we reacted and we welcome that – this development, and we consider that it is – as His Majesty said, it will open a new chapter in our bilateral relations.</p>
<p>The position of Spain is not an isolated one.  There is a dynamic at the international level in support of the Moroccan Autonomy Plan as a serious, credible outcome for this regional dispute.  This is the position of the United States, this is the position of Germany, this is the position of France, this is the position of the Arab countries, this is the position of the African countries, and others.  So that’s why we think it’s time for Europe mainly – and I said that before – to get out of this comfort zone where we – people are just supporting the process.  And supporting a process doesn’t mean supporting a solution.  You can be comfortable in saying yes, we support a process, and this process could last for decades.  What is important now and why there is this dynamic – and de Mistura is also part of this dynamic – is how to shift into an outcome-oriented effort.</p>
<p>And in this regard, in different areas of the world, there is a consensus that this solution should be within Moroccan sovereignty and within the Moroccan Autonomy Plan.  And we hope that other countries will follow to get out of this comfort zone and to be actor in finding a solution instead of being passive in supporting the status quo.</p>
<p>On Ukraine, Moroccan position is very clear and it has been expressed many times.  We are in favor of territorial integrity and national unity of Ukraine, as of all the member states of the United Nations.  We are against the use or the recourse to force in settling disputes.  We are in favor of constructive neighborhood relations, and we are in favor of dialogue and negotiation to solve issues.  This has been our position.  It is clear and it is in line with the UN Charter.  It is in line with the principles of international law in which we believe.</p>
<p>So this position has been expressed, and we had today the opportunity to discuss more details about that.  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Rabat, Morocco</p>
<p>Dar Kika Salam</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you very much, Imane.  Thank you so much for bringing us all together and coordinating this, and also your work supporting STEM curriculums and work in general.  I’ve read a little bit about each of you.  This is a really outstanding group, and it’s just a pleasure and an honor to be with you today.  And I’m really anxious to hear from each of you, but what you have here is the present and future of STEM.  Whether it’s climate change, whether it’s global health, whether it’s agriculture, whether it’s aerospace engineering, you are already working on some of the most important issues of the day, and that’s a very powerful thing.</p>
<p>You’re starting pretty young in your careers, but I also know from what I’ve read – and I want to hear more about that – that you’re already also mentoring other people, and that’s extraordinary, because being able to pass on your experience, your knowledge, and also your support makes a big, big difference.  It has to be a continuous chain.  And somehow, apparently, you’re doing all of this on top of your schoolwork, so that’s remarkable.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not sure which one of you – one of you rescheduled an exam to be here?</p>
<p><b>PARTICIPANT:</b>  Yes.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Now, I don’t know if you can get credit for this or something, but – and I hope I’m not in trouble with the teacher, but thank you for doing that.  If it were up to me, you would get extra credit for being here, but we’ll see what we can do about that.</p>
<p>And then I think some of you are going to actually be studying at American universities in the fall.  So where are you headed?</p>
<p><b>PARTICIPANT:</b>  I’m going to (inaudible) in the fall.<b></b></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s great.  Congratulations on that.  They’re lucky to have you, (inaudible).</p>
<p>The other thing that’s really striking to me is that you are all alumni of our exchange programs, and this is incredibly powerful evidence to me once again of the importance of those programs.  I think it’s one of the single best investments that the United States Government makes.  We’ve had a pretty good ability over the years to identify the most talented people in rising generations in different countries – you’re a wonderful example of that – and to develop relationships with people that hopefully will go on for generations.  And maybe even more important, besides whatever benefits you get, skills you learn, I suspect the connections among you, the networks that you develop through those programs and friends that you may have made either here from our embassy community, or in the United States, will last a lifetime.<b></b></p>
<p>But mostly I’m really eager to hear from you because, I think as powerful examples of women in STEM, you have a great story to tell others, to inspire others, but beyond that to really make a difference in the world on the issues that affect the lives of people everywhere, whether it’s here in Morocco, the United States, or anywhere else.</p>
<p>So I want to stop talking and get you to start talking because I want to hear from you.  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Rabat, Morocco</p>
<p>U.S. Embassy Rabat</p>
<p align="left"><strong>MR GREENE:</strong>  Of course, it is terrific to see everybody face to face.  We haven’t had that many gatherings like this, so I want to welcome everyone here who is here in person, both from Embassy Rabat and from Consulate General Casablanca, including Consul General Lawrence Randolph, who is somewhere in the crowd, with the actual celebrity of the day, Zoe Randolph.  Yes, I’m pandering.  And welcome to everybody.  I think there are some members of the team that are joining us remotely, so thanks everybody who’s with us and couldn’t be here in person.</p>
<p>And of course, welcome to Secretary Blinken and his senior team that have come with him.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, we were at the height of the Omicron wave, and we were pretty much – air space was closed again and we were feeling very cut off and very isolated.  And boy did that change over the last few weeks.  It’s been a very busy time, and that reflects the importance of this relationship and how much we do together bilaterally and regionally.  The African Lion final planning event just finished last week.  We had a fabulous visit by the Special Advisor for International Disability Rights, Sara Minkara, who met with government officials and advocates, and I think was laying out a path for a lot of things we can do together.  And of course two weeks ago we had the visit of Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman, which was a terrific exchange between the government and also with civil society, and a lot of conversations about how we can advance together strategically.</p>
<p>Of course, we have a long history of illustrious deputy secretaries of state visiting.  In 2016, Secretary Blinken visited at that time, and he had a chance to visit this embassy, had a chance to go up to Tangier, visit the Legation, of course which we’re very proud of.  We celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Legation last year; it was a tremendous event, and it really allowed us to highlight the kinds of – the shared history that we have and its importance.</p>
<p>And I think you’ll see during your time here, Mr. Secretary, this mission is working very hard – here and in Casablanca, and all around the country – to advance our national security priorities.  We are trying to protect American citizens better here.  We are advancing economic prosperity for both of our countries, including through the free trade agreement, which also celebrated its 15th anniversary last year.  We’re ensuring that our security partnership remains strong and defends both of our countries.  We’re advancing human rights.  And of course, we’re doing our best to keep this mission safe and keep morale high, keep everybody well supported.</p>
<p>And so with that, I simply just want to say thank you again, welcome to Morocco, welcome back to Morocco.  We’re very eager to hear your thoughts on the state of the world and your responses to some of the questions from our large and diverse mission community.  We know that you and your senior team are very focused on and concerned about our welfare, our ability to get our work done, about the workforce, about our families, and we appreciate that.  And again, we know you’re going to be able to share some of your thoughts with us on all of that.</p>
<p>Of course, we also know the real reason you’re back in Morocco is you got a taste of the food, and you couldn’t stay away.  (Laughter.)  Anyway, Secretary Blinken, thank you so much for being here.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>Thank you.  Woah.  Let’s see how that settles down.</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>AUDIENCE:</strong>  Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I wish I could say sit down, but that might be a little problematic. (Laughter.)  And to our very special guest behind David, I’m really glad to see you.  Hi, sweetie.  (Laughter.)  Good morning.</p>
<p>I’d like to say that we brought a little bit of rain with us, so if that’s the case, I think that’s a very good thing, and I’m happy if we were able to do that.  It is wonderful to be back here.  I have great memories of the trip in 2016 that David referred to, and I am really grateful for the opportunity to pursue so much of the work that’s been going on for a number of years this week.</p>
<p>As you know, we’re coming most immediately from Israel and from the Negev, where, with Foreign Minister Bourita and colleagues from Egypt, from the UAE, and Bahrain, and Israel, we met together in what was I think a collective that few people would have imagined seeing just a few years ago.  And that speaks to so much of the work that you in this mission are doing to really try to focus our energies, our efforts, on dealing with the challenges that are actually having an impact on the lives of our people – whether it’s here in Morocco, back home in the United States, or in the countries that were represented in the Negev, things like dealing with energy security, things like dealing with climate change, global health, something I’ll come back to in a minute, making the kinds of investments that lead to job opportunities and growth, the kind of positive agenda the people are really looking for even as we work to make sure that we are maintaining our security against any challenges and threats that come our way.</p>
<p>But it was a powerful moment, and Morocco, of course, has been for many years a leader in trying to bring people and bring faiths together, and that’s a very powerful thing in this day and age.</p>
<p>David, I want to thank you for your tremendous leadership here at a time of real challenge.  This embassy, this mission across Morocco, like so many other of our missions around the world, have had to deal with COVID-19.  And you’ve had to deal with it on a professional level – it’s made the job a lot tougher – and also on a personal level.  I know many people have suffered, suffered losses, had friends, family, loved ones who have been affected by this.  And I’m just grateful to all of you for the work that you’ve done just to keep the mission going, to carry it forward, and to do it by looking out for each other at the same time.  It makes a big difference.</p>
<p>And you’ve also kept the work going of this mission in a really powerful way.  As I was looking over so much of the agenda that we’ve seen here, a number of things stand out.  The fact that we now have the Millennium Challenge Corporation – I don’t know if we have colleagues here from the MCC, but – funding construction of 15 vocational training centers for industrial jobs.  That’s making a powerful difference in people’s lives.  It’s exactly the kind of thing that we should be doing, we are doing around the world.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the ties between Israel and Morocco, the fact that we’re building on the agreement to normalize relations, and doing it in a powerful way, not just between the two countries but with other countries in the region.</p>
<p>And I want to just mention a couple of people as I go along who played a particularly important role in a number of these initiatives.  I don’t know if Scott Simpson is here today; Scott, are you here?  Anywhere?  Scott?  Thank you.  Thank you for the work that you do to help Israel establish a diplomatic presence.  These things make a big difference.  Thank you.</p>
<p>The consular section in Casablanca processed more immigrant visas last year than before COVID-19.  That’s remarkable work.  And if there’s anyone here from the consular section, thank you.  I’m grateful for that.</p>
<p>So many of you as well stepped up at a time of great need during the evacuation from Afghanistan.  There are a few people I want to mention, if they’re here.  Scott Moore, Amanda Zeiden, Dan Mehring  helped evacuation efforts at the Emirates Humanitarian City.  Are any of you here today?  Thank you.  Thank you for what you did.  (Applause.)  Shawn Tenbrink, Nitza Sola-Rotger – supporting ten Afghan women going to college in Morocco by putting them and their families forward for P1 visas so that they could stay together and eventually come to the United States.  These and so many other efforts – and I’ve seen this across the entire State Department enterprise – at a time of real need, people stepping up, raising their hands, and making a real difference.</p>
<p>I mentioned the challenge of COVID-19 and the effect it’s had on so many of our missions.  What you’ve done here with making sure that you were preserving a strong mission culture has made a real difference, and you’ve done that, again, through this very difficult time.  I know a number of you have volunteered at orphanages in Rabat and Casablanca, playing games, donating toys, donating clothes, making a difference in young people’s lives.  Volunteering that I know was organized by Rhonda Brown, the Marines, the Community Liaison Office, the Federal Women’s Program – thank you to each and every one of you for the work that you’ve done.</p>
<p>I also know that there is an embassy rock band, which I’m very interested in.  Jazz, Latin, rock, country; it includes folks from direct hires, it includes family members, it includes locally employed staff.  I’m even told there’s a saxophone player from the Morocco Philharmonic in that band.  So next time I come back, I hope I actually get a real demonstration.  By the way, I appreciated the soundtrack coming it, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs; it’s one of my favorites.  So thank you for that.</p>
<p>I also want to say to the folks on the medical team here: thank you, thank you, thank you for everything you did during this time to keep our people safe.  It made a real difference.</p>
<p>And finally, let me say as well to the folks in Rabat:  I understand you brought a surprise snow machine in for the kids’ holiday party so they could play in a little bit of a winter wonderland of their own.</p>
<p>Each and every one of these things in and of themselves are important.  Taken together, they really speak to the culture of this mission and the spirit that you’re trying to bring to everything that you do.  As David said, we have a diplomatic relationship that is now more than 200 years old.  Morocco was one of the first, of course, to recognize the United States, in 1777, and Tangier the first – one of the first diplomatic missions that the Marines were sent to protect in 1949.  And can I say to our colleagues from the Marine Corps who are here:  We have a special bond with you.  Every single embassy an American goes to anyplace in the world, the first person they’re likely to see is a U.S. Marine.  We could not do our jobs without you; we’re grateful for everything you do for us every day.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>Finally, finally, every place I go, one of the things that is so striking is the impact and the role that our locally employed staff play in our missions around the world.  You are truly the lifeblood of everything we do.  The connections that you enable us to make in the countries that we’re working in are irreplaceable, invaluable.  And what I see time and time again are partnerships, relationships with locally employed staff that go on for years, even for decades.  So in that spirit, I just want to recognize a couple of people because of their extraordinary service to the United States and with the United States.</p>
<p>El Houssaine Sabri, are you here anywhere?  Well, 41 years of service.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>Khalid El Khoumrani, 37 years of service.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>And plus, as we went down the list, there are 12 locally employed staff here who have served for more than 30 years, six staff 25 years or more.  That is remarkable.  I can’t tell you how grateful I am.  And whether you’ve just started or whether you’ve been here for 41 years, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>We’ve got a new consulate under construction in Casablanca, and we’re aiming to get that up and running by 2024.  And I think as you’ve probably seen, the President announced his intent to nominate a new ambassador, Puneet Talwar.  When Puneet is confirmed by the Senate, you will have a remarkable leader here.  Puneet is long-time colleague of mine, friend of mine, someone with incredible judgment, leadership, and he is going to do extremely well by you and he’s going to do extremely well by the relationship between the United States and Morocco.  So we’re looking forward to getting him here.</p>
<p>But to each and every one of you, whether you are locally employed staff, whether you’re a direct hire, whether you’re a contractor, whether you’re a family member, whether you’re here from one of the many other partner agencies that we’re blessed to work with, I really just wanted to drop by with two simple words:  Thank you.  Thank you for your service.  We’re grateful for it.  (Applause.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Rabat, Morocco</p>
<p>U.S. Embassy Rabat</p>
<p align="left"><strong>MR GREENE:</strong>  Of course, it is terrific to see everybody face to face.  We haven’t had that many gatherings like this, so I want to welcome everyone here who is here in person, both from Embassy Rabat and from Consulate General Casablanca, including Consul General Lawrence Randolph, who is somewhere in the crowd, with the actual celebrity of the day, Zoe Randolph.  Yes, I’m pandering.  And welcome to everybody.  I think there are some members of the team that are joining us remotely, so thanks everybody who’s with us and couldn’t be here in person.</p>
<p>And of course, welcome to Secretary Blinken and his senior team that have come with him.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, we were at the height of the Omicron wave, and we were pretty much – air space was closed again and we were feeling very cut off and very isolated.  And boy did that change over the last few weeks.  It’s been a very busy time, and that reflects the importance of this relationship and how much we do together bilaterally and regionally.  The African Lion final planning event just finished last week.  We had a fabulous visit by the Special Advisor for International Disability Rights, Sara Minkara, who met with government officials and advocates, and I think was laying out a path for a lot of things we can do together.  And of course two weeks ago we had the visit of Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman, which was a terrific exchange between the government and also with civil society, and a lot of conversations about how we can advance together strategically.</p>
<p>Of course, we have a long history of illustrious deputy secretaries of state visiting.  In 2016, Secretary Blinken visited at that time, and he had a chance to visit this embassy, had a chance to go up to Tangier, visit the Legation, of course which we’re very proud of.  We celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Legation last year; it was a tremendous event, and it really allowed us to highlight the kinds of – the shared history that we have and its importance.</p>
<p>And I think you’ll see during your time here, Mr. Secretary, this mission is working very hard – here and in Casablanca, and all around the country – to advance our national security priorities.  We are trying to protect American citizens better here.  We are advancing economic prosperity for both of our countries, including through the free trade agreement, which also celebrated its 15th anniversary last year.  We’re ensuring that our security partnership remains strong and defends both of our countries.  We’re advancing human rights.  And of course, we’re doing our best to keep this mission safe and keep morale high, keep everybody well supported.</p>
<p>And so with that, I simply just want to say thank you again, welcome to Morocco, welcome back to Morocco.  We’re very eager to hear your thoughts on the state of the world and your responses to some of the questions from our large and diverse mission community.  We know that you and your senior team are very focused on and concerned about our welfare, our ability to get our work done, about the workforce, about our families, and we appreciate that.  And again, we know you’re going to be able to share some of your thoughts with us on all of that.</p>
<p>Of course, we also know the real reason you’re back in Morocco is you got a taste of the food, and you couldn’t stay away.  (Laughter.)  Anyway, Secretary Blinken, thank you so much for being here.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>Thank you.  Woah.  Let’s see how that settles down.</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><i>The following is the text of a joint statement by the Governments of the United States of America, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates.</i></p>
<p><i>Begin Text:</i></p>
<p>The United Arab Emirates, United States, and State of Israel have launched an ambitious agenda to promote interfaith and intercultural dialogue and counter religious intolerance and hatred at the inaugural meeting of the Trilateral Religious Coexistence Working Group in Dubai.  A direct outcome of the historic Abraham Accords, the group was announced last October at the first trilateral meeting of the foreign ministers of all three countries and builds on the recently concluded Negev Summit.</p>
<p>The Abraham Accords were signed in September 2020 and formally established relations between the UAE and Israel.  The diplomatic breakthrough continues to create new opportunities for a more peaceful and prosperous Middle East.  The working group expects to expand its membership to include other Abraham Accords signatories, as well as nations that may be interested in establishing relations with Israel.</p>
<p>Working with committed governments, organizations, philanthropies, and dynamic leaders across the region, the working group will support a range of initiatives in areas such as education, youth programming, and religious coexistence.  Some of these activities will be launched later this year. UAE Minister of Health and Prevention Abdul Rahman Al Owais, Israeli Minister of Intelligence Elazar Stern, and US Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights Uzra Zeya represented their respective governments.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Abraham Accords have become the most important force for positive change in the Middle East.  To realize their full potential, we must reverse long-held mistrust, misconceptions, and misgivings about one another. We must find new ways to encourage people-to-people engagement that bridges religions, cultures, and nationalities,&#8221; said Al Owais.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tolerance and coexistence are the paths to our shared humanity and peace.  The Abraham Accords have shattered long-standing paradigms, and now it is our duty to build on them and widen the circle of peace, regionally and globally, through these meetings of the Abrahamic faiths to send a clear message of reconciliation, acceptance, and inclusion.  It is a great honor to lead Israel and the global Jewish community in this historic initiative,&#8221; Minister Stern added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Abraham Accords represent one of the most significant strategic shifts over my three decades of diplomacy in this region and bring clear-cut benefits not just to the countries and peoples concerned, but to the rest of the world as well,&#8221; said Under Secretary Uzra Zeya.<i></i></p>
