					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States and over 30 allies and partners across the world have levied the most impactful, coordinated, and wide-ranging economic restrictions in history in response to the Russian government&#8217;s war against Ukraine.  Today, we take additional actions to raise the economic cost on President Putin.  We are imposing blocking sanctions on two Russian state-owned enterprises:  Joint Stock Company United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC), as well as 28 USC subsidiaries and eight members of the USC board of directors; and Public Joint Stock Company Alrosa.</p>
<p>USC is one of Russia’s largest state-owned enterprises, and it developed and constructed the warships that have bombarded Ukraine’s cities.  Alrosa is a diamond-mining company, controlled by the Russian government, the proceeds of which help to finance the Russian government’s war and atrocities against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Our actions today, alongside the actions we have taken since the beginning of President Putin’s brutal and unjustified war in Ukraine, are designed to reinforce each other and intensify over time.  We remain committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and condemn Russia’s atrocities and disregard for life.  We support accountability for the Kremlin’s wrongdoing in this war of choice.  As long as the Kremlin continues its brutal assault on Ukraine and its people, we stand united with our allies and partners in imposing additional costs on Russia.</p>
<p>For more information on today’s action, please see the Department of the Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0707" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a> and the State Department <a href="https://www.state.gov/additional-state-department-designations-targeting-russian-state-owned-defense-shipbuilding-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">fact sheet</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States welcomes the pledge by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to provide $2 billion in economic support for the Central Bank of Yemen, as well as the pledge by Saudi Arabia to provide $1 billion for development projects and fuel support. This economic support will help stabilize the economy, improve Yemenis’ access to basic services, and ease the economic crisis that causes so much suffering. The United States looks forward to working with regional, international, and private sector partners to strengthen the Yemeni economy.</p>
<p>At a time when funding gaps have forced humanitarians to cut life-saving assistance for millions of Yemenis, the United States also welcomes Saudi Arabia’s pledge to provide $300 million for the UN’s humanitarian response plan. We hope that this support reaches Yemenis in need as soon as possible. The Yemen humanitarian appeal remains less than forty percent funded, and the United States urges more donors to contribute generously and expeditiously to address the suffering of Yemenis.</p>

<p>Americans are, once again, grieving with the Israeli people in the wake of another deadly terrorist attack, which took the lives of two innocent victims and wounded many more in Tel Aviv. Our hearts go out to the families and other loved ones of those killed, and we wish a speedy recovery to the injured. We are closely following developments and will continue to be in regular contact with our Israeli partners, with whom we stand resolutely in the face of senseless terrorism and violence.</p>
<p>May the memories of those who passed be a blessing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>By suspending Russia from the UN Human Rights Council, countries around the world chose to hold Moscow to account today for gross and systematic violations of human rights in its premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war of choice against Ukraine.  We have seen growing evidence of Russia’s brutal disregard for international law and human rights in Ukraine, most notably in the death and devastation it has caused in communities such as Bucha, Irpin, and Mariupol.  The atrocities the world has witnessed appear to be further evidence of war crimes, which serves as another indication that Russia has no place in a body whose primary purpose is to promote respect for human rights.  As I said earlier today, today a wrong has been righted.</p>
<p>The world is sending another clear signal that Russia must immediately and unconditionally cease its war of aggression against Ukraine and honor the principles enshrined in the UN Charter.  The international community will continue to hold Russia to account, and the United States will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine as they fight for their sovereignty, democracy, and freedom.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>On behalf of Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs is soliciting public input for recommendations for this year’s Secretary of State’s Award for Corporate Excellence (ACE).  Now in its 23rd year, the ACE honors U.S. companies demonstrating leadership in their overseas operations, and whose operational practices and decision-making exemplify American values and international best practices.  Recommendations should be submitted to embassies and consulates by June 1, 2022.</p>
<p>For 2022, the ACE categories are:</p>
<p><b>Award for Corporate Excellence in Responsible Business Operations</b></p>
<p><i>This category recognizes a company’s commitment to upholding American values abroad in all its operations, including respecting human rights and labor rights, ethical supply chain management, and promoting democracy.  Candidate companies excelling in this field embrace core American values at home and abroad, including those emphasized during the Summit for Democracy.</i></p>
<p><strong>Award for Corporate Excellence in Climate Resilience</strong></p>
<p><em>This category recognizes a company’s commitment to using methods, investments, and approaches that enable its business and the communities in which it operates to adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis.  Candidate companies excelling in this field address shared climate challenges by contributing to global emissions monitoring, abatement, and adaption, and thus to global economic and human development.  Of particular focus is the candidate company’s efforts to implement solutions and initiatives to protect its own operations as well as communities from the impacts of the climate crisis.</em></p>
<p><strong>Award for Corporate Excellence in Inclusive Economic Growth</strong></p>
<p><em>This category recognizes companies that, through their business and outside efforts, emphasize equity and sustainable development in their host country, including through promoting sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, raising basic standards of living, and fostering social development.  Candidate companies excelling in this field promote American ideals and values such as equality and fairness and are taking concrete steps to ensure under-served populations are not being left out by the economy.  </em></p>
<p><strong>Details on Submitting a Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>ACE nominations are focused on the exemplary operations of a company in a specific country and nominations are officially put forward to the Secretary of State’s office by Chiefs of Mission from U.S. embassies and consulates.  As such, recommendations should be directed to a specific U.S. embassy or consulate for the operations of a U.S. firm in that country.</p>
<p>Stakeholders should contact the U.S. embassy or consulate switchboard during normal business hours and ask to speak with the economic section regarding the Award for Corporate Excellence.  Contact information can be obtained on the website of the respective embassy or consulate.  Chiefs of Mission will evaluate recommendations and determine which to send forward as nominations to the Secretary of State.  Stakeholders are asked to put forward recommendations to embassies and consulates for their consideration and should refrain from lobbying for a particular recommendation once it has been submitted.</p>
<p>Compelling recommendations will include proof of positive impact, particularly with metrics when available; show alignment of core business operations with the category for which the company is being nominated; and demonstrate commitment to the communities where a company does business.  Nominations of small-and-medium-sized firms are encouraged.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p>NATO Headquarters</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good evening, everyone.</p>
<p>Two weeks after my last trip here with President Biden, we’re back in Brussels as part of this administration’s ongoing and urgent efforts with allies and partners to counter the Russian Government’s war of aggression in Ukraine and to stand up for the principles necessary to maintaining international peace and security.</p>
<p>Together, we are sustaining and building on our support for Ukraine – security, humanitarian, economic.  Together, we’re sustaining and building on pressure on the Kremlin and its enablers, including with unprecedented sanctions.  Together, we’re bolstering the defense of NATO itself, including by hardening our eastern flank.</p>
<p>Just over the past 48 hours, I’ve had an opportunity to meet with my NATO counterparts.  For the first time ever, foreign ministers from the United States Indo-Pacific allies – Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea – participated as a group in a NATO ministerial.  Ministers from Georgia, from Finland, from Sweden, and Ukraine also took part, as did the European Union’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell.</p>
<p>In addition, I met with my counterparts from the G7, the world’s leading democratic economies.</p>
<p>The participation of all of these allies and partners highlights the remarkably broad coalition of countries from around the world that are united in standing with Ukraine and against the Russian Government’s aggression – countries that recognize Moscow isn’t just attacking one country, but the entire international rules-based order.</p>
<p>The sickening images and accounts coming out of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine have only strengthened our collective resolve and unity.  In Bucha, a woman described how Russian soldiers forced her and around 40 other people to gather in a small square.  The soldiers brought five young men there and ordered them to kneel.  Then, a Russian soldier shot one of them in the back of the head.  He turned to the people gathered and said of the victim – and I quote – “This is dirt.  We’re here to cleanse you from the dirt.”</p>
<p>That’s just one person Russian soldiers killed in Bucha.  According to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, they’ve already found 410 bodies of dead civilians in that one town alone.  And it’s not just Bucha.</p>
<p>In Motyzhyn, the body of the 50-year-old mayor, Olga Sukhenko, was found in a shallow grave, along with her hands bound, alongside the bodies of her husband and son.  They were last seen alive being taken away by Russian soldiers.</p>
<p>In Kharkiv, a woman who was sheltering at a school with her five-year-old daughter and neighbors when a Russian soldier picked her out and forced her to accompany him to an empty classroom.  He cut her face and knife with a neck – neck with a knife, excuse me – threatened to kill her, and raped her repeatedly at gunpoint.</p>
<p>With each day, more and more credible points of rape, killings, torture are emerging.  And for every Bucha, there are many more towns Russia has occupied and more towns it is still occupying, places where we must assume Russian soldiers are committing more atrocities right now.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’re doing together with our allies and partners to stop this aggression, to stand with Ukraine, and hold accountable those who are responsible.</p>
<p>First, we continue to work in close coordination with allies and partners to raise the costs on the Russian Government for its aggression.  Yesterday, we announced new sanctions on Russia’s largest financial institution and one of its largest private banks, on 21 members of Russia’s national security council, on the adult children of President Putin.  President Biden also signed an executive order prohibiting new investment in Russia by any person in the United States.</p>
<p>The European Union is also actively considering robust new measures, including bans on Russian coal, on Russian vessels accessing EU ports, on transactions with four key financial institutions.</p>
<p>Second, the United States continues to work at an unprecedented pace to help Ukraine defend itself.  Last Friday, the Department of Defense announced $300 million in new security assistance.  On Tuesday, I authorized an additional 100 million to meet Ukraine’s urgent needs for more Javelin anti-armor systems.  This will bring total U.S. security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in February to over $1.7 billion and over $2.4 billion since January of last year.</p>
<p>More than 30 countries have joined us in delivering security assistance to Ukraine, aid that our Ukrainian partners are putting to very effective use, as we see in the Kremlin’s retreat from Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities and towns.  Today, I met again with my colleague and friend, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, to discuss how we can continue to provide Ukraine’s courageous defenders with what they need to keep pushing Russia back.</p>
<p>Third, we continue to provide significant aid to address the acute humanitarian crisis caused by the Kremlin’s war.  More than a quarter of Ukraine’s population – over 11 million people – have been displaced.  That’s roughly equal to displacing the entire population of Belgium, the country we’re in now, in the space of six weeks.  President Biden announced that the U.S. Government is prepared to provide more than $1 billion in new humanitarian assistance to those affected by Russia’s war of aggression.  That comes on top of $293 million we’ve provided in 2022 alone to vulnerable communities in the region, including to neighboring countries that have opened their arms and opened their homes to four million Ukrainian refugees.</p>
<p>The global harm caused by the Kremlin’s aggression is growing, including the disruption it’s caused to the production and distribution of wheat in Ukraine on which so many countries rely, something that I heard about and saw firsthand just a week ago when we were in, among other places, Morocco and Algeria.  In Africa, where a quarter of the population is now facing a food security crisis, Russia’s war of choice has raised the costs of basic staples, worsening the hardship that people were already feeling.  So at the G7, we discussed in some detail ways that we can mitigate the war’s impact on the most vulnerable people around the world.</p>
<p>Fourth, the United State continues to work methodically to collect, to preserve, to analyze evidence of atrocities and to make this information available to the appropriate bodies.  We’re supporting a multinational team of experts that’s assisting a war crimes unit set up by Ukraine’s prosecutor general, with a view toward eventually pursuing criminal accountability.  These efforts will also ensure that Russia cannot escape the verdict of history.</p>
<p>Just moments ago, as I was coming into this room, I learned that UN member states had come together once again to condemn Russia’s aggression and suspend it from the Human Rights Council.  A country that’s perpetrating gross and systematic violations of human rights should not sit on a body whose job it is to protect those rights.  Today a wrong was righted.</p>
<p>Fifth, we discussed ways we can shore up the collective security of our NATO Allies.  As the President has said, we will defend every inch of NATO territory.  We now have 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe.  NATO’s established four new multinational battle groups in Romania, in Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia, in addition to those already in Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, to reinforce our eastern flank.</p>
<p>Sixth, we discussed the additional support that NATO Allies can provide to partners like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia, who are most vulnerable to Russian aggression and threats, from cyber security to combating disinformation.</p>
<p>Finally, we discussed at length a new NATO Strategic Concept.  This is the public blueprint for how the Alliance will continue to safeguard transatlantic security in what is a rapidly changing landscape.  We’ll release that document at the NATO summit in Madrid in June.  President Putin thought, among other things, that he would weaken and divide NATO.  This Strategic Concept will make clear that NATO is in fact stronger, it’s more united, it’s more capable of addressing 21st century threats.</p>
<p>And I can say unequivocally from my discussions with many colleagues here in recent days, colleagues from around the globe, the revulsion at what the Russian Government is doing is palpable.  There’s a greater determination than ever to stand with Ukraine, to shore up and revitalize the international order that Moscow is trying to upend, to bring to bear even greater costs on the Russian Government, to ensure that people are held accountable for their crimes.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  We’ll now turn to questions.  We will start with Vivian Salama from <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks, Ned.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Two questions, if you’ll indulge me.  UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss said today that allies have agreed to help Ukrainian forces move from their Soviet-era equipment to NATO standard equipment on a bilateral basis.  She used very specific language there.  And so is the U.S. going to match that pledge, and if so, can you tell me a little bit about the timeline or when you plan on doing that?</p>
<p>Second question is Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Kuleba said today that as long as the West continues buying Russian gas or oil, it is supporting the Russian war machine.  That’s a direct quote.  Are you pressing Europeans to commit to a timeline – a more aggressive timeline for banning Russian oil and gas?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Great, thanks.  So on the first question, first, as you know and as I said, we have been individually as the United States and collectively as partners – more than 30 countries – providing to Ukraine the weapons and systems that we believe it can use most effectively and that it needs to push back against Russian aggression.  And we’re not going to let anything stand in the way of getting Ukrainians what they need and what we believe can be effective.  So we’re looking across the board right now not only at what we’ve provided and continue to provide but whether there are additional systems that would make a difference and that we could provide them.  And we’re doing that in close consultation with the Ukrainians as well as with allies and partners.</p>
<p>On the energy situation, so we’ve seen over many years a dependence buildup in Europe on Russian gas especially as well as on Russian oil.  And I think what I’m hearing very clearly is a commitment to end that dependence.  We’ve seen again and again Russia use energy as a weapon, as political leverage, and of course, the proceeds that it gets from the sale of its energy is now – yes – helping to fuel its aggression against Ukraine.  And my strong sense is that Europeans are very much committed, as I said, to ending that dependence.  But it’s also not like flipping a light switch.  You have to do it methodically.  You have to put in place the necessary alternatives.  The United States is doing a great deal to help in that regard.  As you know, for this winter alone we’ve worked to make sure that there were sufficient supplies, for example, of LNG to compensate for any losses from decreased sales of Russian energy or a cutoff in Russian energy.</p>
<p>Going forward – you heard President Biden talk about this a couple weeks ago when he was here – we’re committed to increasing the supply of LNG.  Other countries are taking steps to increase supplies of different kinds of energy.  And as I said, Europeans seem committed to moving forward on this.</p>
<p>I think it also tells us how imperative it is that we accelerate the transition to renewables.  And we can, I think – and Europe can make a virtue out of necessity not only by moving away from Russian energy, from Russian gas and oil, but moving toward sustainable energy and toward renewables.  But it’s a process.  It takes time.  But my strong sense is that Europe is committed to doing that.  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Missy Ryan, <em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em>.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Inaudible.)  I have two questions for you.  Foreign Minister Kuleba also today said that as Russia prepares for its concentrated offensive in eastern Ukraine that Kyiv needs new kinds of weapons and more weapons in days, not weeks, or else more people will die.  Has the United States committed or will the United States commit to providing new kinds of weaponry to Ukraine within that timeframe?</p>
<p>And then the second question for you:  Do you believe that the apparent Russian atrocities revealed in Bucha and in other parts of Ukraine make it harder to attain a negotiated settlement to the war?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>So Missy, again, on the weapons, we’ve been doing this all along.  And by the way, the provision of weapons to Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression, President Biden moved out on that aggressively many, many months before the aggression took place because of our concern that Russia was planning and preparing for it.  We did an initial drawdown the President instructed back at the end of last summer, another one in December, and then, of course, many since the aggression.  So one of the reasons that Ukrainians have been able to be so effective in pushing back this Russian aggression, of course, it starts with their extraordinary courage, but it’s also because they already had in hand the weapons necessary to do that.  And then since the aggression, we have repeatedly and continuously, along with many allies and partners, supplied them with the most effective systems that we believe they need to deal with the armored vehicles, to deal with the tanks, to deal with the planes, to deal with the helicopters.</p>
<p>But as I just said, we are looking at day in day out what we believe they most need, to include new systems that have not heretofore been provided.  We’re listening to them in terms of their assessment of what they need.  We’re putting that all together and we’re proceeding, and we have a strong sense of urgency.  That was something that I think was felt among all allies and partners here, here today.</p>
<p>When it comes to Bucha, the atrocities, the war crimes, accountability in and of itself is absolutely necessary.  And this is – we’ve seen this in past conflicts where atrocities have been committed, where war crimes have been committed, and where we have determined to get the evidence, get the facts, build the case, we’ve been able to do that.  And sometimes it’s taken a long time.  The conflicts have come to an end, often through diplomacy.  Accountability has continued.  Sometimes it’s actually not come to a conclusion until many years after the conflict’s ended, but it has.  And one day, one way, there will be accountability.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Does Bucha make it harder to reach – negotiate a settlement?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>The Russians will have to decide if they want to meaningfully engage in diplomacy and in negotiations.  The Ukrainians have made clear that – repeatedly – that they’re prepared to do that, but we have heard – they have heard nothing from the Russians suggesting that they’re serious about it.  I don’t think in a sense Bucha has anything to do with that – it has everything to do with what President Putin’s calculus is, what he decides.</p>
<p>What we can do about it and what we are doing about it is making sure that the Ukrainians have everything that they need to defend themselves and also strengthen their hand at – in any negotiation; that we make sure that we’re keeping the pressure on Russia and indeed increasing that pressure through unprecedented sanctions; and as well, that we shore up NATO’s defenses to take away any notion in Russia’s mind of extending the aggression being committed against Ukraine to a NATO country.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Nick Schifrin, PBS.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Mr. Secretary, thank you.  Der Spiegel and others are reporting that German intelligence picked up over open lines Russian soldiers specifically talking about indiscriminately killing civilians.  Can you confirm that West – the West has recordings of Russian soldiers talking about that?  But the larger question is:  What does it say that Russian soldiers were apparently discussing this over open communications?</p>
<p>And one on diplomacy:  In the lead-up to the war, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov either lied to you or didn’t know what he was talking about.  Can you deal with him in the future?  And the connected question:  Today, as European capitals are evicting Russian officials, will the U.S. follow?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thanks, Nick.  I can’t comment on the specific report that you’re referring to, but what I can say is this – because we’ve said it before:  We said before Russia committed this aggression that if it did, part of its campaign plan was to inflict atrocities, was to target individuals, was to commit the kinds of crimes that we’re now seeing, to terrorize civilian populations.  And so this, as we saw it, was part of the game plan all along.  Now, horrifically, the world is seeing it as we see what happens in Bucha.</p>
<p>And I’ve described it as it’s – there’s a strange thing going on in the sense that, look, our TV screens have been filled for the last 42, 43 days with images coming out of Ukraine thanks to incredibly courageous Ukrainians who are filming things on their smartphones and incredibly courageous reporters who stayed in Ukraine and are trying to bring this to the world.  And yet, sometimes this constant flow of images almost normalizes and trivializes things to the point that people kind of see it as something that’s in the background and don’t respond to it.  But then, something so stark, so outrageous emerges like Bucha that it hits people.  And again, to me, it’s like we’ve seen – as Ukrainians have pushed back this Russian tide, we see with the tide receding what’s left behind, and that is horrific death and destruction.</p>
<p>With regard to diplomacy, look, there are diplomats from various countries that one deals with in the course of doing your job who occasionally have or more than occasionally have an adversarial relationship with the truth.  That’s part of the job.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And the Russian officials?  Will the U.S. follow European &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong> We are always looking at this and we’ll continue to do so.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>We’ll take a final question from Teri Schultz.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I’m up here.  Sorry.  Okay.</p>
<p>Hi.  Thanks, Mr. Secretary.  Sorry, just to follow up on Missy’s question, you yourself called what happened in Bucha outrageous.  Everyone knows the secretary general says that we are preparing for more such atrocities in Mariupol – in Donbas as a major offensive is coming.  How do you sit across the table from Dmytro Kuleba and said, well, we’re looking at what else we think you might need, when he surely comes with a list?  He tells us he came with a list; he gives us his list.  So – and he says he doesn’t have the days that you are taking to look at this.  How do you explain that to him?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I talk to Foreign Minister Kuleba multiple times a week, and we’re constantly going over what it is Ukraine needs, what it is we’re providing, what it is we’re helping other allies and partners provide.  And again, you’ll have to ask him, but I think we were just together maybe an hour ago, and I don’t want to put words in his mouth, but I think he said very clearly the appreciation that he has and that Ukraine has for the support that we have been consistently providing.</p>
<p>So as we’re speaking, we continue to provide what Ukraine needs.  But it’s also a constantly evolving picture.  They are coming – they’re coming forward with new systems that they think that would be helpful and effective.  We put our own expertise to bear, especially the Pentagon, to help determine what indeed we think could be effective, what Ukrainians would be ready to use as soon as they get it, and what we actually have access to and get to them in real time.</p>
<p>So it is an ongoing process.  And again, the fact that the Russians have been pushed out of Kyiv, that they’ve been pushed back to eastern Ukraine, is the product of two things: first, as I said, the extraordinary courage of Ukrainians; but second, the fact that they’ve had in hand, including from before the aggression started, the tools necessary to help achieve that.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p>NATO Headquarters</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good evening, everyone.</p>
<p>Two weeks after my last trip here with President Biden, we’re back in Brussels as part of this administration’s ongoing and urgent efforts with allies and partners to counter the Russian Government’s war of aggression in Ukraine and to stand up for the principles necessary to maintaining international peace and security.</p>
<p>Together, we are sustaining and building on our support for Ukraine – security, humanitarian, economic.  Together, we’re sustaining and building on pressure on the Kremlin and its enablers, including with unprecedented sanctions.  Together, we’re bolstering the defense of NATO itself, including by hardening our eastern flank.</p>
<p>Just over the past 48 hours, I’ve had an opportunity to meet with my NATO counterparts.  For the first time ever, foreign ministers from the United States Indo-Pacific allies – Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea – participated as a group in a NATO ministerial.  Ministers from Georgia, from Finland, from Sweden, and Ukraine also took part, as did the European Union’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell.</p>
<p>In addition, I met with my counterparts from the G7, the world’s leading democratic economies.</p>
<p>The participation of all of these allies and partners highlights the remarkably broad coalition of countries from around the world that are united in standing with Ukraine and against the Russian Government’s aggression – countries that recognize Moscow isn’t just attacking one country, but the entire international rules-based order.</p>
<p>The sickening images and accounts coming out of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine have only strengthened our collective resolve and unity.  In Bucha, a woman described how Russian soldiers forced her and around 40 other people to gather in a small square.  The soldiers brought five young men there and ordered them to kneel.  Then, a Russian soldier shot one of them in the back of the head.  He turned to the people gathered and said of the victim – and I quote – “This is dirt.  We’re here to cleanse you from the dirt.”</p>
<p>That’s just one person Russian soldiers killed in Bucha.  According to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, they’ve already found 410 bodies of dead civilians in that one town alone.  And it’s not just Bucha.</p>
<p>In Motyzhyn, the body of the 50-year-old mayor, Olga Sukhenko, was found in a shallow grave, along with her hands bound, alongside the bodies of her husband and son.  They were last seen alive being taken away by Russian soldiers.</p>
<p>In Kharkiv, a woman who was sheltering at a school with her five-year-old daughter and neighbors when a Russian soldier picked her out and forced her to accompany him to an empty classroom.  He cut her face and knife with a neck – neck with a knife, excuse me – threatened to kill her, and raped her repeatedly at gunpoint.</p>
<p>With each day, more and more credible points of rape, killings, torture are emerging.  And for every Bucha, there are many more towns Russia has occupied and more towns it is still occupying, places where we must assume Russian soldiers are committing more atrocities right now.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’re doing together with our allies and partners to stop this aggression, to stand with Ukraine, and hold accountable those who are responsible.</p>
<p>First, we continue to work in close coordination with allies and partners to raise the costs on the Russian Government for its aggression.  Yesterday, we announced new sanctions on Russia’s largest financial institution and one of its largest private banks, on 21 members of Russia’s national security council, on the adult children of President Putin.  President Biden also signed an executive order prohibiting new investment in Russia by any person in the United States.</p>
<p>The European Union is also actively considering robust new measures, including bans on Russian coal, on Russian vessels accessing EU ports, on transactions with four key financial institutions.</p>
<p>Second, the United States continues to work at an unprecedented pace to help Ukraine defend itself.  Last Friday, the Department of Defense announced $300 million in new security assistance.  On Tuesday, I authorized an additional 100 million to meet Ukraine’s urgent needs for more Javelin anti-armor systems.  This will bring total U.S. security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in February to over $1.7 billion and over $2.4 billion since January of last year.</p>
<p>More than 30 countries have joined us in delivering security assistance to Ukraine, aid that our Ukrainian partners are putting to very effective use, as we see in the Kremlin’s retreat from Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities and towns.  Today, I met again with my colleague and friend, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, to discuss how we can continue to provide Ukraine’s courageous defenders with what they need to keep pushing Russia back.</p>
<p>Third, we continue to provide significant aid to address the acute humanitarian crisis caused by the Kremlin’s war.  More than a quarter of Ukraine’s population – over 11 million people – have been displaced.  That’s roughly equal to displacing the entire population of Belgium, the country we’re in now, in the space of six weeks.  President Biden announced that the U.S. Government is prepared to provide more than $1 billion in new humanitarian assistance to those affected by Russia’s war of aggression.  That comes on top of $293 million we’ve provided in 2022 alone to vulnerable communities in the region, including to neighboring countries that have opened their arms and opened their homes to four million Ukrainian refugees.</p>
<p>The global harm caused by the Kremlin’s aggression is growing, including the disruption it’s caused to the production and distribution of wheat in Ukraine on which so many countries rely, something that I heard about and saw firsthand just a week ago when we were in, among other places, Morocco and Algeria.  In Africa, where a quarter of the population is now facing a food security crisis, Russia’s war of choice has raised the costs of basic staples, worsening the hardship that people were already feeling.  So at the G7, we discussed in some detail ways that we can mitigate the war’s impact on the most vulnerable people around the world.</p>
<p>Fourth, the United State continues to work methodically to collect, to preserve, to analyze evidence of atrocities and to make this information available to the appropriate bodies.  We’re supporting a multinational team of experts that’s assisting a war crimes unit set up by Ukraine’s prosecutor general, with a view toward eventually pursuing criminal accountability.  These efforts will also ensure that Russia cannot escape the verdict of history.</p>
<p>Just moments ago, as I was coming into this room, I learned that UN member states had come together once again to condemn Russia’s aggression and suspend it from the Human Rights Council.  A country that’s perpetrating gross and systematic violations of human rights should not sit on a body whose job it is to protect those rights.  Today a wrong was righted.</p>
<p>Fifth, we discussed ways we can shore up the collective security of our NATO Allies.  As the President has said, we will defend every inch of NATO territory.  We now have 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe.  NATO’s established four new multinational battle groups in Romania, in Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia, in addition to those already in Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, to reinforce our eastern flank.</p>
<p>Sixth, we discussed the additional support that NATO Allies can provide to partners like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia, who are most vulnerable to Russian aggression and threats, from cyber security to combating disinformation.</p>
<p>Finally, we discussed at length a new NATO Strategic Concept.  This is the public blueprint for how the Alliance will continue to safeguard transatlantic security in what is a rapidly changing landscape.  We’ll release that document at the NATO summit in Madrid in June.  President Putin thought, among other things, that he would weaken and divide NATO.  This Strategic Concept will make clear that NATO is in fact stronger, it’s more united, it’s more capable of addressing 21st century threats.</p>
<p>And I can say unequivocally from my discussions with many colleagues here in recent days, colleagues from around the globe, the revulsion at what the Russian Government is doing is palpable.  There’s a greater determination than ever to stand with Ukraine, to shore up and revitalize the international order that Moscow is trying to upend, to bring to bear even greater costs on the Russian Government, to ensure that people are held accountable for their crimes.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  We’ll now turn to questions.  We will start with Vivian Salama from <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks, Ned.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Two questions, if you’ll indulge me.  UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss said today that allies have agreed to help Ukrainian forces move from their Soviet-era equipment to NATO standard equipment on a bilateral basis.  She used very specific language there.  And so is the U.S. going to match that pledge, and if so, can you tell me a little bit about the timeline or when you plan on doing that?</p>
<p>Second question is Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Kuleba said today that as long as the West continues buying Russian gas or oil, it is supporting the Russian war machine.  That’s a direct quote.  Are you pressing Europeans to commit to a timeline – a more aggressive timeline for banning Russian oil and gas?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Great, thanks.  So on the first question, first, as you know and as I said, we have been individually as the United States and collectively as partners – more than 30 countries – providing to Ukraine the weapons and systems that we believe it can use most effectively and that it needs to push back against Russian aggression.  And we’re not going to let anything stand in the way of getting Ukrainians what they need and what we believe can be effective.  So we’re looking across the board right now not only at what we’ve provided and continue to provide but whether there are additional systems that would make a difference and that we could provide them.  And we’re doing that in close consultation with the Ukrainians as well as with allies and partners.</p>

<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Missy Ryan, <em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em>.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Inaudible.)  I have two questions for you.  Foreign Minister Kuleba also today said that as Russia prepares for its concentrated offensive in eastern Ukraine that Kyiv needs new kinds of weapons and more weapons in days, not weeks, or else more people will die.  Has the United States committed or will the United States commit to providing new kinds of weaponry to Ukraine within that timeframe?</p>
<p>And then the second question for you:  Do you believe that the apparent Russian atrocities revealed in Bucha and in other parts of Ukraine make it harder to attain a negotiated settlement to the war?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>So Missy, again, on the weapons, we’ve been doing this all along.  And by the way, the provision of weapons to Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression, President Biden moved out on that aggressively many, many months before the aggression took place because of our concern that Russia was planning and preparing for it.  We did an initial drawdown the President instructed back at the end of last summer, another one in December, and then, of course, many since the aggression.  So one of the reasons that Ukrainians have been able to be so effective in pushing back this Russian aggression, of course, it starts with their extraordinary courage, but it’s also because they already had in hand the weapons necessary to do that.  And then since the aggression, we have repeatedly and continuously, along with many allies and partners, supplied them with the most effective systems that we believe they need to deal with the armored vehicles, to deal with the tanks, to deal with the planes, to deal with the helicopters.</p>
<p>But as I just said, we are looking at day in day out what we believe they most need, to include new systems that have not heretofore been provided.  We’re listening to them in terms of their assessment of what they need.  We’re putting that all together and we’re proceeding, and we have a strong sense of urgency.  That was something that I think was felt among all allies and partners here, here today.</p>
<p>When it comes to Bucha, the atrocities, the war crimes, accountability in and of itself is absolutely necessary.  And this is – we’ve seen this in past conflicts where atrocities have been committed, where war crimes have been committed, and where we have determined to get the evidence, get the facts, build the case, we’ve been able to do that.  And sometimes it’s taken a long time.  The conflicts have come to an end, often through diplomacy.  Accountability has continued.  Sometimes it’s actually not come to a conclusion until many years after the conflict’s ended, but it has.  And one day, one way, there will be accountability.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Does Bucha make it harder to reach – negotiate a settlement?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>The Russians will have to decide if they want to meaningfully engage in diplomacy and in negotiations.  The Ukrainians have made clear that – repeatedly – that they’re prepared to do that, but we have heard – they have heard nothing from the Russians suggesting that they’re serious about it.  I don’t think in a sense Bucha has anything to do with that – it has everything to do with what President Putin’s calculus is, what he decides.</p>
<p>What we can do about it and what we are doing about it is making sure that the Ukrainians have everything that they need to defend themselves and also strengthen their hand at – in any negotiation; that we make sure that we’re keeping the pressure on Russia and indeed increasing that pressure through unprecedented sanctions; and as well, that we shore up NATO’s defenses to take away any notion in Russia’s mind of extending the aggression being committed against Ukraine to a NATO country.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Nick Schifrin, PBS.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Mr. Secretary, thank you.  Der Spiegel and others are reporting that German intelligence picked up over open lines Russian soldiers specifically talking about indiscriminately killing civilians.  Can you confirm that West – the West has recordings of Russian soldiers talking about that?  But the larger question is:  What does it say that Russian soldiers were apparently discussing this over open communications?</p>
<p>And one on diplomacy:  In the lead-up to the war, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov either lied to you or didn’t know what he was talking about.  Can you deal with him in the future?  And the connected question:  Today, as European capitals are evicting Russian officials, will the U.S. follow?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thanks, Nick.  I can’t comment on the specific report that you’re referring to, but what I can say is this – because we’ve said it before:  We said before Russia committed this aggression that if it did, part of its campaign plan was to inflict atrocities, was to target individuals, was to commit the kinds of crimes that we’re now seeing, to terrorize civilian populations.  And so this, as we saw it, was part of the game plan all along.  Now, horrifically, the world is seeing it as we see what happens in Bucha.</p>
<p>And I’ve described it as it’s – there’s a strange thing going on in the sense that, look, our TV screens have been filled for the last 42, 43 days with images coming out of Ukraine thanks to incredibly courageous Ukrainians who are filming things on their smartphones and incredibly courageous reporters who stayed in Ukraine and are trying to bring this to the world.  And yet, sometimes this constant flow of images almost normalizes and trivializes things to the point that people kind of see it as something that’s in the background and don’t respond to it.  But then, something so stark, so outrageous emerges like Bucha that it hits people.  And again, to me, it’s like we’ve seen – as Ukrainians have pushed back this Russian tide, we see with the tide receding what’s left behind, and that is horrific death and destruction.</p>
<p>With regard to diplomacy, look, there are diplomats from various countries that one deals with in the course of doing your job who occasionally have or more than occasionally have an adversarial relationship with the truth.  That’s part of the job.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And the Russian officials?  Will the U.S. follow European &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong> We are always looking at this and we’ll continue to do so.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>We’ll take a final question from Teri Schultz.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I’m up here.  Sorry.  Okay.</p>
<p>Hi.  Thanks, Mr. Secretary.  Sorry, just to follow up on Missy’s question, you yourself called what happened in Bucha outrageous.  Everyone knows the secretary general says that we are preparing for more such atrocities in Mariupol – in Donbas as a major offensive is coming.  How do you sit across the table from Dmytro Kuleba and said, well, we’re looking at what else we think you might need, when he surely comes with a list?  He tells us he came with a list; he gives us his list.  So – and he says he doesn’t have the days that you are taking to look at this.  How do you explain that to him?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I talk to Foreign Minister Kuleba multiple times a week, and we’re constantly going over what it is Ukraine needs, what it is we’re providing, what it is we’re helping other allies and partners provide.  And again, you’ll have to ask him, but I think we were just together maybe an hour ago, and I don’t want to put words in his mouth, but I think he said very clearly the appreciation that he has and that Ukraine has for the support that we have been consistently providing.</p>
<p>So as we’re speaking, we continue to provide what Ukraine needs.  But it’s also a constantly evolving picture.  They are coming – they’re coming forward with new systems that they think that would be helpful and effective.  We put our own expertise to bear, especially the Pentagon, to help determine what indeed we think could be effective, what Ukrainians would be ready to use as soon as they get it, and what we actually have access to and get to them in real time.</p>
<p>So it is an ongoing process.  And again, the fact that the Russians have been pushed out of Kyiv, that they’ve been pushed back to eastern Ukraine, is the product of two things: first, as I said, the extraordinary courage of Ukrainians; but second, the fact that they’ve had in hand, including from before the aggression started, the tools necessary to help achieve that.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p>NATO Headquarters</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It’s always a pleasure to be with my friend and colleague, Dmytro Kuleba.  It’s especially a pleasure to see him now, to see him in person, especially under the circumstances.  I just have to say, as we were saying in the NATO meeting that we just came from, Dmytro, your personal courage is emblematic of that of the Ukrainian people.  We have great admiration for you, for all of our Ukrainian friends in this incredibly difficult time.</p>
<p>But I think what you heard today from all of our allies and partners from the Asia-Pacific region as well was a tremendous sense of solidarity in support of Ukraine against Russia’s outrageous aggression, and doing everything that we can to continue not only to sustain our support to Ukraine, but to build on it; not only to continue the pressure that we’re exerting against Russia, but to build on it; and to see to it that Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence is fully asserted and protected in advance.</p>
<p>So there’s a lot of work that goes into that, but this was a very, very good opportunity to hear directly from you about your assessment of the situation on the ground, and then the work that we’re doing together between the United States and Ukraine but also amongst so many different countries that support Ukraine in this difficult moment.  So, good to see you, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER KULEBA:</strong>  Likewise.  We speak regularly, we meet regularly, and I appreciate that you and I can talk on literally any given moment when the need arises.  This is how a relationship between two real friends and strategic partners should evolve.</p>
<p>Ukraine is grateful to the United States for ironclad diplomatic and military support, and for the leadership in – of the United States in initiating, imposing, and enforcing sanctions against Russia.  I have told you once that the recipe of Ukrainian victory in this war – it’s the Ukrainian stamina plus Western weapons and sanctions against Russia.</p>
<p>And I am satisfied with the dynamics of our cooperation on weapons and on sanctions as well, but when it comes to sanction – to weapons – and this is the point that I made today to all allies – we have no doubts that in the end, Ukraine will get everything that it needs and will overcome all the reluctance and hesitation coming from some allies when it comes to specific weapons.  But the issue of timeline is crucial, and I’m looking forward to our conversation today to discuss the timeline of supplies of the weapons which are needed to defend Ukraine.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank you for reaching out to third countries who haven’t taken their firm stance on the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and for explaining to them not only what happened – what is happening, but also the global repercussions of the Russian aggression against my country.  It’s important to mobilize the entire world that stands for democracy and respect of the rule-based order.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you, everyone.</p>
