					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><em>The following is being released jointly by the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International Development.</em></p>
<p><em>Begin text:</em></p>
<p>The U.S. Government is moving forward in the spirit of partnership with four countries and a regional grouping of countries to implement the ten-year U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability.  This represents an important milestone and next step in the realization of the goals of the landmark Global Fragility Act, which continues to enjoy strong bipartisan Congressional support for innovative efforts to foster a more peaceful and stable world.  In light of the horrific events unfolding in Ukraine caused by Putin’s unprovoked and brutal war, the United States reaffirms its commitment to strengthen global resiliency and democratic renewal, and promote peaceful, self-reliant nations that become U.S. economic and security partners.</p>
<p>Our partner countries under the Strategy include Haiti, Libya, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and a grouping of Coastal West African countries comprised of Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Togo.  Each collaboration presents a unique opportunity to leverage lessons learned from decades of U.S. involvement overseas, to enhance the way the U.S. Government engages in challenging environments, and to jointly build resilience against political, economic, and natural shocks.</p>
<p>The U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability outlines a ten-year, whole-of-government effort to foster peace and long-term stability through integrated diplomacy, development, and security-sector engagement.  The Strategy builds upon and strengthens the work done to implement the U.S. Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act, and ongoing efforts to prevent and counter violent extremism.  It will leverage and advance other priorities, such as to promote democracy, good governance, and respect for human rights; advance gender equality; counter corruption; reduce the risks of the climate crisis; and bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The Strategy’s flexible approach is designed to take into account and address the underlying causes of violence and instability before conflicts and crises can break out or deteriorate.  The Strategy seeks to tailor our shared approach to the unique circumstances of each local and regional context, and to elevate local voices to jointly seek on-the-ground solutions to prevent conflict.  The United States will take a long-term view, working closely with like-minded and committed local partners.  Pursuant to the Strategy, we will support stabilization in areas where violence impedes development and threatens U.S. and partner strategic interests.  These efforts will improve lives and livelihoods in the process.</p>
<p>Our work is rooted in a deep and abiding commitment to put diplomacy and shared values first.  Success will require strong leadership, patience, creativity, and a constructive relationship with our international and local partners.  Peacebuilding and conflict prevention are needed now more than ever, and the United States looks forward to working with others to create a more peaceful world.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S.-Kazakhstan Air Transport Agreement signed on December 30, 2019, has entered into force.  This bilateral Agreement establishes a modern civil aviation relationship with Kazakhstan consistent with U.S. Open Skies international aviation policy and with U.S. commitments to high standards of aviation safety and security.  The Agreement includes provisions that allow for unrestricted capacity and frequency of services, open route rights, a liberal charter regime, and open code-sharing opportunities.</p>
<p>This Agreement between the United States and Kazakhstan is also a step forward in liberalizing the international civil aviation sector in Central Asia.  It will further expand our strong economic and commercial partnership; promote people-to-people ties; and create new opportunities for airlines, travel companies, and customers.  Air carriers can provide more affordable, convenient, and efficient air services to travelers and shippers, which in turn promotes tourism and commerce.</p>
<p>Information on U.S. aviation policy and our Open Skies air transport agreements is available on the Department of State’s website here: <a href="https://www.state.gov/civil-air-transport-agreements" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">https://www.state.gov/civil-air-transport-agreements//</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States is committed to strengthening global resiliency and democratic renewal, and promoting peaceful, self-reliant nations that become strong economic and security partners capable of addressing shared challenges.  To that end, the U.S. Government is moving forward in the spirit of partnership with Haiti, Libya, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and five countries in the Coastal West Africa region (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Togo) to implement the ten-year U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability.</p>
<p>Along with our friends and allies and the wider international community, we are facing destabilizing transnational challenges, which disrupt ways of life, economies, and whole societies.  Democratic governance and respect for human rights are increasingly under threat as violent extremists and practitioners of oppression assert their authoritarian will through coercion and violence.  Through this Strategy, we will confront these negative global trends and create new models for broader cooperation, grounded in mutual accountability and enduring stability.</p>
<p>We are fully committed to successful implementation of the Strategy and look forward to working together with the selected countries to create and implement long-term, locally-led plans to build resilience, strengthen the roots of stability, and prevent conflict.  We will factor in the sometimes difficult lessons learned from decades of U.S. involvement in stabilization efforts and apply them to how we engage through our new approach.</p>
<p>The State Department will lead this whole-of-government Strategy to align U.S. capabilities in diplomacy, development, and the security sector.  Working closely with in-country partners, businesses, and civil society organizations at the national and local levels, we will shape a common purpose to harness all the tools at our disposal in support of the Strategy, through our Embassies overseas, our country and technical experts in Washington, and with integrated and intentional planning and monitoring, evaluation, and learning across the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>I am grateful to the U.S. Congress for its passage of the landmark bipartisan Global Fragility Act that underpins this Strategy and demands a fundamental shift in how we work to prevent conflict globally.  I also appreciate those in civil society and expert communities who advocated for the Act and will be crucial to help us turn it into action.  Thanks to all of these efforts, we now have an ambitious framework for engaging creatively with our global partners to anticipate and prevent conflict and promote stability.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>On Tuesday, March 29, representatives from the United States and nine other governments, alongside additional non-governmental organizations from the United States and other countries, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, local government, and academia convened a three-day workshop to share best practices and innovations in refugee resettlement.</p>
<p>This Working Group on Resettlement is being held in Denver, Colorado to showcase U.S. resettlement programs locally and nationally that assist newly arrived refugees to integrate into U.S. communities. The Working Group will highlight the process of reception and integration of refugees, the strong partnerships between federal, state, and local governments, the critical role played by the non-governmental sector in service delivery, and the recent overwhelming response from private citizens to help support the large numbers of Afghans and other refugees being assisted throughout the United States.</p>
<p>Successful refugee resettlement would not be possible without the support of local communities; faith-based organizations; local and state governments; and congressional offices.  We are grateful for the hospitality and welcome that the people of Denver and Colorado more broadly have provided to us this week, as well as the generous welcome communities across the United States provide to refugees who have fled persecution and are making a new life for themselves and their families.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States will continue to impose severe costs on the Russian Federation in response to President Putin’s illegal war.  Today, we are targeting entities and individuals in our efforts to shut down the Kremlin’s sanctions evasion networks, which play an important role in the Russian Federation’s ability to continue its unconscionable war on the citizens of Ukraine.  This follows our March 15 and March 24 designations of individuals and companies in Russia’s defense-industrial base that are directly supporting Putin’s war machine.</p>
<p>Today, the United States is designating 21 entities and 13 individuals.  Of those being designated, 10 of those individuals and 17 entities are involved in sanctions evasion networks to procure of western technology.  These designations will further impede Russia’s access to western technology and the international financial system.  We will continue to target President Putin’s war machine with sanctions from every angle, until this senseless war of choice is over.  The Russian Federation not only continues to violate the sovereignty of Ukraine with its attacks, but it is escalating the devastation of population centers, including schools, hospitals, residential areas, and places where civilians are taking shelter from the Russian bombardment.</p>
<p>The United States is also designating three individuals for their involvement in malicious cyber activities, one of whom the Department of Justice <a class="external-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-russian-government-employees-charged-two-historical-hacking-campaigns-targeting-critical" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">indicted</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a> last week.  The United States will continue to hold President Putin’s cyber actors to account for disruptive, destructive, or otherwise destabilizing cyber activity targeting the United States and its allies and partners.</p>
<p>In addition to the sanctions imposed today, the Department of the Treasury is also expanding its Russia sanctions authorities.  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with me, identified the aerospace, marine, and electronics sectors of the Russian Federation economy pursuant to section 1(a)(i) of Executive Order 14024.  This allows for sanctions to be imposed on any individual or entity determined to operate or have operated in any of those sectors and provides an expanded ability to swiftly impose additional economic costs on Russia for its war of choice in Ukraine.</p>
<p>These actions demonstrate our resolve to hold the Russian Federation accountable for its aggression against Ukraine and commitment to take further actions against persons supporting evasion of the sanctions that the United States and our allies and partners have put in place.  We will use all authorities at our disposal to enforce sanctions, expose and identify malicious actors, and promote accountability for President Putin’s war of choice.</p>
<p>For more information on today’s action, please see the Department of the Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0692" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

<p>Located on a 12.2-acre site in the rapidly developing Eko Atlantic City on Victoria Island, the new U.S. Consulate General in Lagos will support diplomatic and commercial relations between the United States and Nigeria and will provide U.S. and Nigerian Consulate employees with a safe, secure, sustainable, and modern workplace.  The construction project will take approximately five years, with completion expected in 2027.<u></u></p>
<p>Ennead Architects LLP of New York is the design architect, Pernix Federal, LLC of Lombard, Illinois, is the design/build contractor, and EYP, Inc. of Albany, New York, is the architect of record.  A variety of energy efficiency strategies will be incorporated into the site and building design to address varied seasonal conditions and to significantly reduce energy demand.</p>
<p>The new Consulate construction project will directly benefit the Nigerian people.  Over the course of construction, an estimated $95 million will be invested in the local economy through local subcontractors, and suppliers.  Overall, the project will employ approximately 2,500 Nigerian citizens, including engineers, architects, artisans, construction workers, and administrative staff.</p>
<p>Since the start of the Department’s Capital Security Construction Program in 1999, OBO has completed 171 new diplomatic facilities.  OBO currently has more than 50 active projects either in the design phase or under construction worldwide.</p>
<p>OBO provides safe, secure, functional, and resilient facilities that represent the U.S. government to the host nation and that support U.S. diplomats in advancing U.S. foreign policy objectives abroad.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On Transgender Day of Visibility, the United States affirms that transgender rights are human rights.  We celebrate the achievements and resilience of transgender, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming persons around the world.  We recognize their bravery in their hard-fought work for equality, inclusion, and the full recognition of their human rights.  We celebrate the diverse expressions of gender and the full diversity of gender identities around the world.</p>
<p>At the same time, we underscore the work that remains to ensure that all transgender, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming persons are able to live authentically, safely, and with dignity.  Transgender people face disproportionate levels of violence from physical attacks to denial of necessary, gender-affirming medical care, to the passage of discriminatory laws targeting transgender persons.  Those who face multiple intersecting forms of discrimination are even more vulnerable to these attacks.  Transgender persons must be able to live free from violence, discrimination, and stigma.</p>
<p>We call on governments and other partners around the globe to join us in fighting for a world in which everyone can live safely and openly as themselves.  We will not waver in our commitment to upholding the human rights of transgender, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming persons worldwide.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The following is the text of a joint press release by the U.S. Department of State and the European External Action Service.</p>
<p><em>Begin text:</em></p>
<p>The European Union and the United States held today in Washington, D.C., the first U.S.-EU High-Level Dialogue on Russia.  Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland represented the United States and European External Action Service Deputy Secretary General for Political Affairs Enrique Mora represented the European Union.  This high-level meeting follows the commitments taken at the June 2021 U.S.-EU Summit, where both sides resolved to coordinate U.S. and EU policies and actions related to Russia.  This inaugural session focused on U.S. and EU strategic objectives and policy coordination aimed at ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Under Secretary Nuland and Deputy Secretary General Mora welcomed the exceptional unity shown at the recent European Council, extraordinary NATO Leaders’ Meeting, and G7 Leaders’ Meeting.  They condemned the Kremlin’s unprovoked, unjustifiable, and barbaric war against Ukraine, also enabled by the Belarusian government.  The Russian military attacks striking civilians are causing massive loss of life and injury to civilians and must stop immediately.  They noted that the United States and the European Union will work to track reports of war crimes and will share information gathered with allies, partners, international institutions and organizations, as appropriate, and use every tool available to hold the perpetrators to account.</p>
<p>Under Secretary Nuland and Deputy Secretary General Mora welcomed the coordination between the United States and the European Union in implementing unprecedented sanctions and export control measures in response to Russia’s aggression and discussed continued close cooperation in coordination with the G7 to ensure stringent implementation of these measures.  They also discussed additional steps to isolate Russia further from the U.S. and EU economies and the international financial system to impose severe costs on Russia for its actions.</p>
<p>The two sides emphasized the necessity of consolidating international support for the government and people of Ukraine and of holding the government of Russia to account.  They welcomed the growing number of countries applying sanctions and export control measures since Russia’s invasion, including countries implementing them for the first time, and reiterated their commitment to further expanding the coalition and strengthening enforcement of these measures.  They underlined the importance of insisting that China supports an immediate end to hostilities, the establishment of humanitarian corridors, and preventing any risks of further escalation.  They also underscored that they will continue to urge China not to circumvent nor undermine sanctions against Russia, and not to provide any form of support to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Under Secretary Nuland and Deputy Secretary General Mora discussed U.S. and EU efforts to increase humanitarian support to all people who have been internally displaced or forced to flee as a result of Putin’s war.  They briefed on U.S. and EU initiatives to provide coordinated political, financial, material and humanitarian support to the government and people of Ukraine.  They recognized the need to maintain high-level attention and support to the Republic of Moldova and to work together to strengthen its resilience.  They also discussed their ongoing efforts to support the democratic forces inside and outside of Belarus in defending and advancing human rights, including freedom of expression, and free and fair elections under international observation.</p>
<p>They took stock of U.S. and EU efforts to counter the Kremlin’s propaganda and disinformation and to reduce Europe’s reliance on Russian energy.  They underscored that the United States and EU stand with Russian civil society, independent journalists, and youth whose future and voices are under increasing threat within Russia and with those who have been forced to flee the country.   They also recognized continued U.S.-EU cooperation toward long-term peace, resilience, and stability in the wider region, including South Caucasus.</p>
<p>Under Secretary Nuland and Deputy Secretary General Mora decided to continue meetings in this dialogue, with the next high-level meeting to take place in late 2022.</p>
