					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary Antony J. Blinken will travel to Vatican City on June 28, where he will meet with Pope Francis and Archbishop Paul Gallagher to discuss efforts to work together to tackle the climate crisis and promote peace and human rights around the world.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States Celebrates Strong Relations with the Holy See </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States and Holy See enjoy a close partnership to promote human rights, combat human trafficking and climate change, and seek peaceful solutions to crises around the world. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Holy See maintains formal diplomatic relations with 183 countries. Its influence extends to more than 1.3 billion Catholics worldwide and millions of non-Catholics as well.  With a grassroots presence in almost every country in the world, the Holy See is a critical partner.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Holy See – through Catholic religious orders, lay communities, and faith-based organizations – is among the greatest humanitarian forces in the world. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States values its cooperation with the Holy See and Catholic organizations on the ground to deliver humanitarian aid successfully and efficiently to individuals and communities in need all around the world. By maintaining and strengthening diplomatic relations with the Holy See, the United States benefits from its unparalleled global presence. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tackling the Climate Crisis </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">His Holiness Pope Francis has shown longstanding leadership on the imperative to tackle the climate crisis, calling on political leaders and civil society to care for the environment. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States and Holy See are working together to raise countries’ collective ambition to address the climate crisis, including by raising and implementing national emissions reductions targets. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promoting Human Rights is a U.S.-Holy See Priority </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The protection of human rights is a key priority for the United States. The Holy See has long been a global champion of human dignity, and the United States looks forward to working with the Vatican on this issue. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Holy See has a long history of promoting freedom of religion or belief, including through advocacy and interfaith dialogue. </span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human trafficking is a threat to international peace and security.  Traffickers undermine the rule of law and violate human dignity, robbing women, children, and men of their freedom. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Holy See and the United States share a common commitment to the fight against human trafficking, and the Holy See is a valued partner in the global effort to prevent this heinous crime. </span></li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congratulations, Prime Minister Mario Draghi. I look forward to working closely with you to deepen our strong bilateral relationship, cooperate during your leadership of the G20, and address global challenges from COVID to climate change</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– President Joseph R. Biden, February 14, 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary Antony J. Blinken will travel to Rome and Matera, Italy, June 27-29, where he will meet with Italian President Sergio Mattarella, Prime Minister Mario Draghi, and Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio to discuss the importance of Transatlantic unity and our strong bilateral relationship.  They will also discuss the economic and security ties that strengthen our enduring partnership with Italy.  Secretary Blinken will then co-chair the D-ISIS Ministerial with Foreign Minister Di Maio, before traveling to Matera to attend the G20 Foreign Affairs Ministerial Meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States and Italy are Close Partners and Allies </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States looks forward to strengthening the excellent cooperation between our two countries, both as NATO Allies and long-standing economic partners. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our relationship is deep and enduring.  The United States established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 and reaffirmed them in 1946 when Italy became a republic. We have built a strong partnership based on common values and shared historical and familial bonds.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 20 million Americans proudly claim Italian heritage. Throughout our history, Italian-Americans have greatly enriched the fabric of American life. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italy and the United States share a commitment to the same values – democracy, human rights, the rule of law, security, and prosperity.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We welcome Italy’s focus on combatting the COVID-19 pandemic, tackling the climate crisis, and fostering a sustainable economic recovery during its G20 presidency this year. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Cooperation is at the Heart of Our Partnership </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italy is a key NATO Ally, a leader and guarantor of security in the international community, and a reliable partner. Italy plays a crucial role in guaranteeing Transatlantic security, particularly in assuring NATO’s southern flank and through its participation in UN and NATO missions in Iraq, Kosovo, Lebanon, and Afghanistan.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italy also plays an important role in marshaling international support for progress in Libya.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. military maintains a presence at five major military installations in Italy, where it is a welcoming host to more than 33,000 U.S. troops, Department of Defense civilians, and their family members.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italy hosts the U.S. Navy’s 6th Fleet headquarters in Naples and NATO’s Joint Force Command outside of Naples in Lago Patria.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States and Italy agree that we must do more jointly to address shared threats in the Mediterranean region and around the world. At the June 14 NATO Summit, President Biden and Prime Minister Draghi endorsed a series of proposals to revitalize NATO through the NATO 2030 initiative.  The United States and Italy also collaborate closely as part of the Global Coalition’s efforts to defeat ISIS.  We look forward to continuing that work.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economies and Workers Benefit from Our Close Economic and Educational Ties </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Un</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ited States represents Italy’s largest non-EU export market. Our two-way trade in goods and services amounted to $80 billion last year.  Our relationship, which ranges from trade in consumer goods and agricultural products to cooperation in the defense industries, has spurred collaboration in fields outside the economic realm, including security and space technology. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 2019, Italy’s direct investment in the United States totaled $32.8 billion, while U.S. direct investment in Italy was $34.9 billion. As of 2018, U.S. jobs tied to Italian direct investment in the United States totaled 93,700, while 250,000 Italian jobs were tied to U.S. direct investment in Italy. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italy is the second most popular destination for American study abroad students in the world, with more than 35,000 U.S. students studying there each year.  Italian students are also increasingly attracted to education exchange programs in the United States.  In the 2019/2020 academic year, more than 6,000 Italians chose to study at a U.S. college or university. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the establishment of the U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission in 1948, approximately 14,000 Italian and American students, teachers, lecturers, and researchers have participated in the Fulbright international exchange program, enhancing scholarship through educational exchange. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S.-Italy Fulbright Program has produced alumni who have had enduring impacts on their fields, including Italian Prime Ministers Giuliano Amato and Lamberto Dini, eight Nobel laureates, twelve Pulitzer Prize winners, and five MacArthur Foundation Fellows.</span></li>

<p>Quai d’Orsay</p>
<p>Paris, France</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via Translation</span></i></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antony Blinken, good evening.  Thank you very much for agreeing to answer our questions.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s my pleasure.  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, when Joe Biden appointed you head of American diplomacy, we, French people, wanted to see it as a sign because you speak absolutely perfect French.  You lived in France, in Paris, when you were a student.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, you are too nice.  In fact, the good thing is that since January, I have had the opportunity to practice my French, especially when collaborating with my friend Jean-Yves Le Drian and with other French colleagues.  Indeed, I came to France at the age of 9.  I stayed until I was 18.  I passed my baccalaureate in Paris and then obviously, I’ve kept in touch ever since.  I even came back when I was 30 before starting a career in government.  I spent two more years in Paris.  I made friends then who are still friends today.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precisely, it is often said that the French and the Americans are like cousins.  And yet, in recent years, we have also discovered sometimes rather brutally that we do not always think the same.  You are familiar with both ways of thinking.  What would you say? What makes us different sometimes?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes there are differences – nuances, changes in tactics, sometimes on issues.  That’s normal.  It’s normal in a family.  It’s normal with friends.  But, more important than our differences, are the things that bring us together on a deeper level.  That is what I learned in my youth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are certain values, ​​and we use these words very easily, but there is something behind these values, which we, French and Americans, are trying to implement.  Liberty, equality, fraternity. That means something.  The obligation to support human rights means something.  And most importantly, right now we both live in democracies that are being significantly challenged, both internally and externally.  I think we both see the same challenge: it is to show through our actions, and especially our collective actions, to our citizens, that we can obtain results that will improve their lives and, hopefully, the lives of people around the world.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antony Blinken, the French people know you too, since you appear in one of the most famous photos of the last ten years, in the Situation room, near Barack Obama during the assault on Osama bin Laden. Would you say that it is the highlight of your career?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s mostly – it’s true that it was a highlight. The strongest? I don’t know, but it’s something that I remember because it was a moment of justice, if you will, because he was the one who led the attack on the United States for seven years. So it was a moment of justice for him, for us and above all, of course, there was some tension because the mission was complicated.  And finally, it was a relief.  But it is indeed an important moment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, I have to tell you that a few weeks after this photo was taken – I am in the background.  We have a TV show, back home, in the evening, with a comedian called David Letterman, you may also know him in France, who showed a close-up of this photo.  One of my government colleagues was on set with him.  He pointed at me, and he said, “Who is that guy in the back of the picture? Is this someone who got lost because he was trying to visit the White House?” So, this moment is both a moment I will remember all my life, and one that will keep things in perspective.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden has chosen to travel to Europe for the first time for the sake of the Europeans, with a very strong message: to restore a relationship of trust battered by the four years of Donald Trump’s mandate.  How do you assess the damage caused by this Trump mandate in your mission?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m totally focused on today and tomorrow and the work we need to do together to face the challenges…</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when you arrive in a country, you must feel that these four years have been difficult and that they have damaged this relationship between Europe and America.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember two things.  First of all, there is a resurgence of confidence between the United States and our closest allies.  And especially with France.  This is very important, and this for a very practical reason.  When we look at the challenges that we’re facing – whether it be the challenge of this COVID pandemic, the climate, the emergence of new technologies that have major impacts on the lives of our citizens – we find that there is no one country acting alone that has the capacity to deal effectively with these problems and there is no wall that we can build high enough, strong enough, to avoid them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, at the moment, I think there is a need to work together, to find the means to cooperate, to coordinate, to work together.  And that’s why President Biden wanted to focus on our partnerships during the first six months, our alliances with our closest friends, and our oldest ally: France.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will it be a more balanced relationship? It is true that before, the United States appeared to be masters of the world.  During these four Trump years, there was also a lot of humiliation. The Europeans have been forced to find another balance.  It implies that you can’t go back to the same relationship as before.  Do we need a more balanced relationship?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, you can’t go back because the world has changed and is changing extremely quickly.  So, above all what we need is to work and face these challenges together and not look back.  And that also involves, maybe, doing things differently. Listening is as important as talking. And I think we have done some important work, especially these last six months, not only in terms of our commitment to our partners and friends, but above all by listening to them – whether it is bilaterally, or in the G7, in NATO, in the EU – and that allows us to establish a joint approach much more effectively.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one point that we do not quite agree upon, and that is the way you see China.  It is true that you consider this country an adversary, even a commercial enemy, and it is true that it is a tone with which the Europeans take a little distance, in particular Emmanuel Macron.  Do you think we are being naive with China?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I’ve seen, especially these last few weeks, is a convergence with regard to the approach to China and I think we see it the same way.  It is, for all our countries, a very complicated relationship that cannot be simplified with a single word or a single sentence.  But what I will say, and I think we have the same point of view with France, is that there are antagonistic elements in the relationship, competitive elements, and elements of cooperation.  And what’s important, whether it’s antagonistic, whether it’s competitive, whether it’s cooperative, is that we will have a lot more impact when we approach China together than if we act alone.  And whether it is at the G7, NATO, or the EU, I think that we have seen a convergence in the declarations and in the decisions that have been made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I want to be clear on this, our goal is not to hold China back. It is not to establish a policy against China.  It is to support a free and open system based on the rules and standards that France and the United States established after WWII, and which have served us well.  Because if we don’t have a system where countries act according to the rules, respecting the agreements they have made, the alternative is war. It’s a jungle, it’s the law of the jungle, the survival of the fittest.  And we know from our common history that it leads somewhere we no longer want to go.  So, for us, the idea is to support this system with our allies and partners, not against China, but for a positive vision of the future and relations between countries.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have two final questions.  There is one area in which our cooperation is unprecedented.  It is the military.  France and the United States are working together, and in particular in the Sahel.  We know that France is imagining another form of engagement in the field.  Will the United States participate in the future coalition, particularly in terms of intelligence and logistical support? How are you prepared to continue helping us in the Sahel?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is simple.  Quite simply: yes, we have a very important partnership with France in the Sahel.  We have a lot of appreciation for the leadership of France.  I think it makes perfect sense to rework the strategy.  It’s obviously been eight years now since France has been involved with the Sahel and above all, we are trying to strengthen the capacity of our partners on the ground, not only to strengthen their military capacities, but also their capacities for governance and to create a future for their people.  I believe this is the right thing to do, while obviously maintaining what it takes to counter terrorism, and we will do it together.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden will receive Angela Merkel on July 15 at the White House.  It is said that the United States chose Germany as their main partner in Europe.  You yourself, a few days ago, said that there was no better friend of America than Germany.  Isn’t that a little surprising given our common history?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, our common history is that France is our oldest friend.  When we founded our country &#8212;</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Independence.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">France was there for our independence.  Something we never forget.  The best symbol of our democracy is the Statue of Liberty from France.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will there be a meeting between Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, absolutely, there has obviously already been a meeting in Cornwall.  A very, very, not only positive, but productive meeting.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have an invitation to give to Emmanuel Macron?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am sure and convinced that we will have the opportunity and the chance to receive the President of the French Republic.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you very much Antony Blinken for agreeing to answer our questions.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you.</span></p>

<p>Paris, France</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via Translation</span></i></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antony Blinken, good evening.  Thank you very much for agreeing to answer our questions.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s my pleasure.  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, when Joe Biden appointed you head of American diplomacy, we, French people, wanted to see it as a sign because you speak absolutely perfect French.  You lived in France, in Paris, when you were a student.</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, you are too nice.  In fact, the good thing is that since January, I have had the opportunity to practice my French, especially when collaborating with my friend Jean-Yves Le Drian and with other French colleagues.  Indeed, I came to France at the age of 9.  I stayed until I was 18.  I passed my baccalaureate in Paris and then obviously, I’ve kept in touch ever since.  I even came back when I was 30 before starting a career in government.  I spent two more years in Paris.  I made friends then who are still friends today.</span></p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Precisely, it is often said that the French and the Americans are like cousins.  And yet, in recent years, we have also discovered sometimes rather brutally that we do not always think the same.  You are familiar with both ways of thinking.  What would you say? What makes us different sometimes?</span></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes there are differences – nuances, changes in tactics, sometimes on issues.  That’s normal.  It’s normal in a family.  It’s normal with friends.  But, more important than our differences, are the things that bring us together on a deeper level.  That is what I learned in my youth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are certain values, ​​and we use these words very easily, but there is something behind these values, which we, French and Americans, are trying to implement.  Liberty, equality, fraternity. That means something.  The obligation to support human rights means something.  And most importantly, right now we both live in democracies that are being significantly challenged, both internally and externally.  I think we both see the same challenge: it is to show through our actions, and especially our collective actions, to our citizens, that we can obtain results that will improve their lives and, hopefully, the lives of people around the world.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, we recognize the bravery and humanity of victims and survivors of torture around the world.  The absolute prohibition of torture is a human right enshrined in international law.  Since its inception in 1987, 171 countries—including the United States—have become parties to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which is inspired by Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its core tenet: “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, we continue to see governments using torture and other violations of human rights as tools of ongoing repression against political opponents, members of minority groups and marginalized populations, human rights advocates, and those who simply voice an opinion that these governments do not like.  The United States condemns torture wherever and whenever it occurs and strongly urges governments to abide by their international obligations and end impunity for these crimes.  We also underscore the importance of rehabilitation and transitional justice so victims and survivors can transition from horror to healing.  For this reason, the United States is the largest contributor to the UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture that provides support to survivors and their families. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today is an opportunity for UN Member States, civil society, and individuals around the globe to unite against torture and urge truth, justice, and accountability for perpetrators of this human rights violation.  As long as there are those who would commit torture, the United States will not waver in its commitment to eliminate it. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>We are appalled and deeply saddened to learn about the horrific killings of three Doctors Without Borders staff members in Ethiopia&#8217;s Tigray region today.  Attacks on humanitarian workers are indefensible and must end immediately.  We call for an independent investigation and for the perpetrators to be held accountable for these killings.  The Government of Ethiopia ultimately bears full responsibility for ensuring the safety of humanitarian workers and free and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance.  A cessation of hostilities is essential to ensure that humanitarian workers can safely assist citizens, prevent further suffering, and address the myriad challenges, including famine.</p>

<p>We are appalled and deeply saddened to learn about the horrific killings of three Doctors Without Borders staff members in Ethiopia&#8217;s Tigray region today.  Attacks on humanitarian workers are indefensible and must end immediately.  We call for an independent investigation and for the perpetrators to be held accountable for these killings.  The Government of Ethiopia ultimately bears full responsibility for ensuring the safety of humanitarian workers and free and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance.  A cessation of hostilities is essential to ensure that humanitarian workers can safely assist citizens, prevent further suffering, and address the myriad challenges, including famine.</p>
