					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Three months ago, we lowered our flag over the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, just days before Russian forces streamed across Ukraine’s border to carry out President Putin’s unprovoked, unjustified war of choice.  When we suspended operations at the embassy, we made the point clear: while we would relocate U.S. embassy personnel for their safety and security, this would in no way prevent our engagement with, and support for, the Ukrainian people, government, and civil society as well as our allies and partners.  We underscored our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, pledged to continue our assistance, and started working toward the day we could return to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Now, that day has come. Today we are officially resuming operations at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.  The Ukrainian people, with our security assistance, have defended their homeland in the face of Russia’s unconscionable invasion, and, as a result, the Stars and Stripes are flying over the Embassy once again. We stand proudly with, and continue to support, the government and people of Ukraine as they defend their country from the Kremlin’s brutal war of aggression.</p>
<p>As we take this momentous step, we have put forward additional measures to increase the safety of our colleagues who are returning to Kyiv and have enhanced our security measures and protocols.</p>
<p>We are committed to confronting the challenges ahead.  The war rages on.  Russia&#8217;s forces inflict death and destruction on Ukrainian soil every day.  Millions of Ukrainians are displaced from their homes and mourn the loss of their loved ones.  With strength of purpose, we reaffirm our commitment to the people and government of Ukraine, and we look forward to carrying out our mission from the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>New York, New York</p>
<p>United Nations Headquarters</p>
<p><b>AMBASSADOR THOMAS-GREENFIELD:  </b>Good morning, everyone.  Let me thank you, every one of you, for joining us today to open up a dialogue about a wide range of shared issues, particularly on climate, conflict, prosperity, and on food security.  We also want to talk to you about how we can strengthen our partnership here at the UN.</p>
<p>I recently had a series of meetings that I call listening tours with African ambassadors here at the UN, and in those meetings, I heard loud and clear that people in Africa are hurting from food and fuel price surges that have been exacerbated by Russia’s war on Ukraine.  As you know, the United States is making food security a core focus of our presidency of the Security Council for the second year in a row, and right now we’re hosting a series of Days of Action to bring this crisis to the forefront.</p>
<p>When I first raised this issue in the Security Council in March of 2021, we discussed how COVID, climate, conflict, and strained global supply chains were driving millions more people closer to hunger and malnutrition.  In recent months, the war in Ukraine, a major supplier of wheat and other agricultural commodities, has further disrupted global food supplies.  And let me just note that we have a very strong statement, a roadmap for action, that we encourage you all to sign as a concrete outcome of the food security ministerial later today.</p>
<p>This meeting is an opportunity.  It’s an opportunity for us to hear directly from you at the highest levels about this issue and so much more.  We want to know what you are seeing and experiencing on the ground, and how we can find ways to work together on a path forward.</p>
<p>To that end, I now have the great privilege of introducing the United States Secretary of State, Secretary Blinken.  I’m so grateful he took the time out of his busy schedule to bring us together here today, and I know he’s looking forward to hearing from all of you what you all have to say.  Secretary Blinken, the floor is yours.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Linda, thank you very, very much, both for the words of introduction but especially for everything you’re doing every single day here at the United Nations to represent the United States so effectively, including with so many of our partners around the table today.  And I want to extend the same thanks to our Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Molly Phee, for her constant leadership and engagement with the countries of Africa, with the people of Africa, with the institutions of Africa.</p>
<p>And I just want to pick up at the – on something, Linda, you just said, which is I really am here, we are here today to listen, to hear from you, because we want to know how you are experiencing this acute challenge of food insecurity, and especially ideas for how we can work together to address it.  So, I’m grateful to all of you for joining us today, those who will come in shortly.  It means a great deal to have the opportunity to spend some time in person.  Looking forward to the ministerial very soon.</p>
<p>Any conversation about food security has to focus on what’s happening across Africa.  Your countries are bearing some of the heaviest burdens.  It’s something we see, we recognize.  No one knows better than you what solutions would help, and which might fall short.  There are many reasons for the current food crisis.  Linda alluded to some of them, including, of course, the economic ramifications of COVID-19, the accelerated climate crisis which all of us are feeling acutely and which people across Africa have been experiencing firsthand for a long time.  Right now, the countries in the Horn of Africa are experiencing a brutal fourth consecutive drought season with, we know, devastating consequences.</p>
<p>And, as Linda said, Russia’s war in Ukraine has also had a major effect.  We had a preexisting condition that’s been significantly exacerbated by this aggression, and an additional 40 million people are believed as a result to be at risk of food insecurity.  We’ve seen global food shortages and rising prices for food, fertilizer, for fuel.  And while people worldwide are now dealing with these shortages and dealing with the high prices, people across Africa, we know, have been hit particularly hard.  There was a recent study by our U.S. Agency for International Development that found that 32 of the 39 countries at greatest risk from this acute food crisis are in Africa.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize something because it really is important, and I know it firsthand – I can attest to this firsthand.  The United States held hundreds of engagements to try to prevent this senseless war against Ukraine.  We reached out repeatedly to our Russian partners, to NATO, the African Union, the European Union, other allies and partners.  President Putin invaded anyway.  The sanctions that dozens of countries have imposed on Russia after the invasion included very clear carveouts for food, for fertilizer, for seeds.  But the Kremlin has chosen to deliberately hold back these exports from Ukraine.  There’s an abundance of grain, of wheat that was produced this year in Ukraine; it is just sitting there because it cannot get out of the country.  Why can’t it get out of the country?  Because Russia is blockading the ports from which it would leave and targeting, indeed, those ports, targeting farms and the lands for cultivation.  Ukrainian farmers in many cases have been forced into a choice of either fighting for the freedom of their country or fleeing.</p>
<p>All of this together has had a major impact.  And because Ukraine is one of the world’s top exporters of key crops, including corn, as well as wheat, seeds for cooking oil, the result that we’re seeing is that people around the world are suffering the consequences of choices that President Putin has made, and especially, again, people across Africa.  So, that’s why it’s critical that we get together today so that we can hear directly from you what your citizens are actually dealing with and how we can help.  For example, if there is specific assistance that countries need to ensure that sanctions don’t prevent the flow of food or fertilizer to you, we want to know. And we’re ready to act fast to help.</p>
<p>When I had the opportunity to visit Kenya and Nigeria and Senegal in November, I talked about how the United States sees the countries of Africa as partners in solving the challenges that we face.  Food security is one of the most urgent of those challenges, and simply put, we want to partner with you on a coordinated response.</p>
<p>So, let me just very briefly summarize what we’ve committed to do to try to end the near-term crisis as well as focus on the long term, and then we’re extremely anxious to hear from each of you.</p>
<p>First, we’re addressing the humanitarian needs caused by the war of aggression against Ukraine.  Just since February, the United States has pledged more than $2.3 billion of food assistance.  And pending final approval from our Congress, we’ll provide more than 5 billion in additional aid, including more than $760 million specifically for global food security.  Plus, today we’re announcing an additional $215 million for emergency food assistance in Algeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Mauritania, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Kenya, among other countries.</p>
<p>Second, we are working to alleviate what is also a global fertilizer shortage, including by boosting our domestic production.  President Biden committed an additional $250 million just a week ago for a total of $500 million invested in American fertilizer production this year.</p>
<p>Finally, we’re focused on building agricultural resilience over the long term.  And here I really want to commend the great work of the African Development Bank with its $1 billion plan to help 40 million African farmers use climate-resilient technologies and increase crop yields.  Likewise, we have our Feed the Future initiative that’s focused for 15 years on creating long-term improvements to food security, including with partners across Africa.  We’re growing Feed the Future with another $5 billion over the next three years and expanding it to new countries, including, indeed, primarily in Africa.</p>
<p>These investments show that global food security is a priority for the United States, and we want to do all that we can to coordinate and cooperate with our partners to help countries with the most urgent needs get the relief that they need fast while investing in their own food production.</p>
<p>Most important, we know that we do not have all the answers, and we certainly are not in the position of dictating solutions from afar.  We’re eager to hear, again, what we can do, what we can do better, how we can do it more effectively, understand how the crisis is really affecting your countries, and especially, again, get your ideas for how to solve it and how we can help.</p>
<p>So, with that said, I’m very, very grateful for everyone’s participation today, and let’s open it up for conversation.</p>

<p>United Nations Headquarters</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good morning, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPANT:</strong>  Good morning, sir.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  It’s good to see you all.  It’s particularly good to see the foreign minister.  This is our first opportunity to meet face-to-face.  We’ve spoken on the phone.  We are very pleased to be working with the foreign minister, with a new government in Pakistan.</p>
<p>We’re both here, of course, first and foremost for the ministerial meeting we’re having a little bit later today on food security.  This is a challenge that we’re seeing around the world.  There was a pre-existing condition, as it were, when it comes to food insecurity in many places.  It’s been exacerbated dramatically by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, adding another 40 million people to those who are food insecure.</p>
<p>So we’re coming together and I’m grateful for Pakistan’s participation and engagement on this to look at concrete steps we can take to address the food insecurity issues, to help people in need around the world.  But beyond that, this is an important opportunity for us to talk about the many issues where we’re working together.  We want to focus on the work we’re doing to strengthen our economic and commercial ties between the United States and Pakistan; of course, focus on regional security.  And Pakistan is now in the chairmanship of the G77 and the United States is looking forward to strengthening our own relations and dialogue and communication with the G77.  I look very much forward to speaking to the foreign minister about that.</p>
<p>But in short, welcome to New York.  It’s very good to have you here, very good to be with you at the United Nations.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER ZARDARI:</strong>  Thank you so much, Secretary Blinken.  It is such a pleasure to be here at the United Nations, and where I really look forward to engaging on this series of events on global food security.  We are aware that recent geopolitical events have indeed aggravated the situation, and countries like Pakistan have already been facing challenges in food security, water security, energy insecurity because of a whole host of issues ranging from climate change to issues in our neighborhood.  So this particular initiative is most welcome and most important.</p>
<p>I also look forward to the opportunity to increasing engagement between Pakistan and the United States, working with yourself and your administration to improve trade relations between Pakistan and the United States and create opportunities for American investors, and Pakistani investors, and Pakistani businessmen, and American entrepreneurs to work together.  And I really look forward to working with you on both these issues.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.  Great to have you here.  Thanks, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER ZARDARI:</strong>  Thank you so much, everybody.  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Amidst Russia&#8217;s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine, the Lukashenka regime in Belarus has found new ways to intimidate and punish its own citizens, including by approving legislation to apply the death penalty to pro-democracy activists and those opposing Russia’s war in Ukraine.  Specifically, new amendments to the criminal code permit the use of the death penalty for individuals convicted of “attempted acts of terrorism.”  The regime has levied politically motivated charges of “extremism” and “terrorism” against many of the more than 1,100 political prisoners and used such labels to detain tens of thousands more.  These are citizens of Belarus seeking to freely exercise their fundamental freedoms – peaceful protesters, civil society members, journalists, political opponents and those arrested for opposing Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and Belarus’s enabling role in it.  These citizens now also face the threat of the death penalty.</p>
<p>The Lukashenka regime continues to repress, including through violence and these recent amendments to the criminal code, the pro-democracy and anti-war movements in Belarus.  These actions are those of an authoritarian leader desperate to cling to power through fear and intimidation.  The world has observed for almost two years the strength and bravery of the Belarusian people who continue to stand up for their rights in the face of brutal authoritarianism, often at grave personal costs.  The Belarusian people have demonstrated time and time again that the regime cannot silence their calls for democracy.  Only a national dialogue inclusive of civil society and the democratic movement will lead Belarus out of its current political stalemate to a future democratic and prosperous Belarus.</p>
<p>Ahead of the May 21 commemoration of the Day of Political Prisoners in Belarus, we reiterate our calls for the unconditional release of all political prisoners, an end to the regime’s violence against its own citizens, and a national dialogue inclusive of civil society and the democratic movement, leading to free and fair elections under international observation.  We are committed to promoting accountability, and to that end have designated hundreds of Belarusian entities and officials for sanctions or visa restrictions for their involvement in human rights abuses, the undermining of democracy in Belarus, electoral fraud, or corruption.  The perpetrators of these human rights abuses will be held to account.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s unprecedented health threats demand close international cooperation.  The World Health Assembly (WHA) is the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), and its annual meeting is an opportunity to drive cooperation towards ending the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and advancing global health and global health security.  We strongly advocate for the WHO to invite Taiwan to participate as an observer and lend its expertise to the solution-seeking discussions at the 75th WHA this May.</p>
<p>Inviting Taiwan to attend the WHA as an observer would exemplify the WHO’s commitment to an inclusive approach to international health cooperation and “health for all.” Taiwan is a highly capable, engaged, and responsible member of the global health community, and it has been invited to participate as an observer in previous WHA meetings.  Taiwan and its distinct capabilities and approaches – including its significant public health expertise, democratic governance, resilience to COVID-19, and robust economy – offer considerable value to inform the WHA’s deliberations.  There is no reasonable justification to exclude its participation, which will benefit the world.  As we continue to fight COVID-19 and other emerging health threats, Taiwan’s isolation from the preeminent global health forum is unwarranted and undermines inclusive global public health cooperation.</p>
<p>Viruses do not respect borders, and no one is safe until everyone around the world is safe from such threats.  The United States will continue to partner with the WHO to demonstrate global, inclusive leadership in making the world healthier and better able to prevent, detect, prepare for, and respond to health emergencies.</p>
<p>We will continue to support Taiwan’s membership in international organizations where statehood is not a requirement and encourage Taiwan’s meaningful participation in organizations where its membership is not possible, in line with our One China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three U.S.-China Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is committed to ending hunger and malnutrition and building more sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems around the world. In support of these ongoing efforts, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is traveling to New York City May 18-19 to convene meetings to mobilize action on global food security.</p>
<p>In 2021, more than 193 million people worldwide experienced acute food insecurity, an increase of 40 million people from the year before. It is estimated that as many as 40 million people are projected to be pushed into poverty and food insecurity by the end of the year. Shortages of fuel and fertilizer in many countries and accelerating spikes in food prices threaten to destabilize fragile societies, increase hunger and malnutrition, drive migration, and cause severe economic dislocation. Conflict has greatly exacerbated food security issues globally.</p>
<p>The “Days of Action on Global Food Security” is one component of the United States’ multi-pronged strategy to help mitigate the food security crisis through humanitarian assistance, multilateral engagements, and increased food production. We are taking action to end hunger and malnutrition and build more sustainable, equitable, and resilient food systems at home and abroad.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have announced over $2.3 billion in new global humanitarian food assistance since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, with a particular focus on countries hardest hit by food price hikes.</li>
<li>We will announce additional new emergency food assistance at the May 18 Food Security Ministerial, bringing the U.S. total for emergency food assistance since February to nearly $2.6 billion.</li>
<li>The United States is doing its part at home to mitigate the global fertilizer shortage by acting to boost domestic production of fertilizer through a $500 million USDA program.</li>
<li>Through Feed the Future and our nutrition commitments, we are committing over $5 billion over the next five years to address food security threats and nutrition across the globe in addition to the over $4 billion in humanitarian assistance funding, recently signed into law, for Ukraine and its neighbors.</li>
<li>We will issue a Roadmap for the Global Food Security Call to Action to reflect the outcomes of the May 18 Food Security Ministerial, outlining commitments that participants have made to address these challenges.</li>
<li>We will strengthen resilience by building inclusive and equitable food systems that empower women, youth, and disadvantaged communities to weather the effects of climate change, conflict, and supply chain disruptions, as noted at the UN Food Systems Summit last year.</li>
<li>The United States is working in multilateral fora with our Group of Seven (G7) partners to target the work of international finance institutions, including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), to mitigate food security challenges.</li>
<li>The United States recognizes the critical role so many around the world are currently playing to address food insecurity – from governments to the UN to civil society organizations. This current crisis requires a global, collaborative response, and the United States is committed to helping to coordinate these efforts.</li>
