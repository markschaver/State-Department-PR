					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is working with our African partners, including South Africa, to dismantle ISIS financial support networks on the continent.  Today, the United States designated four ISIS and ISIS-Mozambique (ISIS-M) financial facilitators in South Africa.  Farhad Hoomer, Siraaj Miller, Abdella Hussein Abadigga, and Peter Charles Mbaga are being designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended, which targets terrorist groups and their supporters, among others.</p>
<p>ISIS members and associates in South Africa are playing a role in facilitating the transfer of funds from the top of the ISIS hierarchy to branches across Africa.  Those designated today have provided financial support or served as leaders of ISIS cells in South Africa.  ISIS and ISIS-M are distinct and separately-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTOs) under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended.</p>
<p>ISIS has attempted to expand its influence in Africa through large-scale operations particularly in areas where government control is limited.  ISIS branches in Africa rely on local fundraising schemes such as theft, extortion of local populations, and kidnapping for ransom as well as financial support from the ISIS hierarchy.</p>
<p>We are taking today’s action to further disrupt and expose key ISIS and ISIS-M supporters who raise revenue for ISIS and exploit South Africa’s financial system to facilitate funding for ISIS branches and networks across Africa.</p>
<p>For more information this action, please see the Department of the Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0616" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States welcomes the historic opportunity at the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA 5.2), February-March 2022, to start a process with other nations and stakeholders to fight plastic pollution.  The United States is already acting both domestically and internationally to address this global challenge.</p>
<p>Key U.S. programs are highlighted below.</p>
<p><strong><u>National</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Recycling Strategy: </strong>EPA published the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recyclingstrategy">National Recycling Strategy</a> November 2021 and reaffirmed the goal to increase the U.S. recycling rate to 50 percent by 2030.  The Strategy identifies strategic objectives and actions needed to create a stronger, more resilient, and cost-effective U.S. municipal solid waste recycling system.  Recycling has been an important component of the EPA’s decades-long efforts to implement the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and more recent efforts to pursue a Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) approach, which aims to reduce the environmental impacts of materials across their lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) program:</strong> EPA releases an annual report, <em>Advancing Sustainable Materials Management:  Facts and Figures</em>, to provide information on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation, recycling, composting, combustion with energy recovery and landfilling.  The report analyzes MSW trends in generation and management, materials and products, and economic indicators affecting MSW.</li>
<li><strong>WasteWise Program:</strong> EPA works with businesses, governments, and nonprofit organizations <a href="https://www.epa.gov/smm/wastewise">to promote the use and reuse of materials</a> more productively over their entire life cycles. Partners demonstrate how they reduce waste, practice environmental stewardship and incorporate sustainable materials management into their business model, including their waste-handling processes.</li>
<li><strong>Trash Free Waters</strong> is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters">a voluntary program</a> that emphasizes stakeholder engagement to assist U.S. and international communities with addressing primarily land-based sources of marine litter. Within the United States, there have been more than 200 place-based projects that have been or are being implemented.
<ul>
<li><a class="external-link" href="https://www.epa.gov/international-cooperation/trash-free-waters-tfw-international-implementation-guide#:~:text=The%20Trash%20Free%20Waters%20(TFW,based%20sources%20of%20marine%20litter" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">The Trash Free Waters International Implementation Guide</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a> – a tool that provides step-by-step guidance for including all stakeholders, either at the national, state, or community level in decision-making to address land-based sources of marine litter.</li>
<li><a class="external-link" href="https://www.epa.gov/international-cooperation/solid-waste-management-guide-developing-countries" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">Best Practices for Solid Waste Management: A Guide for Decision-Makers in Developing Countries</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a> – The Guide covers a diverse set of important topics for city-level decision-makers around the world<u>,</u> including stakeholder engagement, waste management planning and economics, waste collection and transportation, prevention, minimization, and recycling, landfill design and operation, and energy recovery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DOE launched the <strong>Plastics Innovation Challenge</strong> in 2018 to coordinate the many initiatives across the department on plastic recycling, degradation, upcycling, and design for circularity. The goals of this program are to develop solutions that deliver greater than 50 percent energy savings, address greater than 90 percent of plastics, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than50 percent, and achieve at least 75 percent carbon utilization.  The work includes solving fundamental science challenges through research projects and Energy Frontier Research Centers, forging public-private partnerships such as the <strong>BOTTLE Consortia</strong> (<a href="http://www.bottle.org/">bottle.org</a>) and the <strong>REMADE</strong> Institute, and working with industry partners to reduce plastic waste through the <strong>Better Plants Program</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>USDA offers support and programs to increase the research, development and buyer/consumer awareness of bioplastics. <strong>Agricultural Research Service </strong>scientists developed a way for crop residues from cornstalks, straw, and sugarcane bagasse, combined with sustainable enzymes, to convert crop-derived sugars into compounds used in the sustainable manufacture of nylon plastics.  USDA’s <strong>BioPreferred Program</strong> works to increase the purchase and use of biobased products through federal procurement and a certification and labeling initiative.  The program’s USDA <strong>Certified Biobased Product </strong>label is a market development initiative to increase consumer and buyer recognition, and the purchase of bioproducts.</li>
</ul>

<p>The United States welcomes the historic opportunity at the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA 5.2), February-March 2022, to start a process with other nations and stakeholders to fight plastic pollution.  The United States is already acting both domestically and internationally to address this global challenge.</p>
<p>Key U.S. programs are highlighted below.</p>
<p><strong><u>National</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Recycling Strategy: </strong>EPA published the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recyclingstrategy">National Recycling Strategy</a> November 2021 and reaffirmed the goal to increase the U.S. recycling rate to 50 percent by 2030.  The Strategy identifies strategic objectives and actions needed to create a stronger, more resilient, and cost-effective U.S. municipal solid waste recycling system.  Recycling has been an important component of the EPA’s decades-long efforts to implement the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and more recent efforts to pursue a Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) approach, which aims to reduce the environmental impacts of materials across their lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) program:</strong> EPA releases an annual report, <em>Advancing Sustainable Materials Management:  Facts and Figures</em>, to provide information on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation, recycling, composting, combustion with energy recovery and landfilling.  The report analyzes MSW trends in generation and management, materials and products, and economic indicators affecting MSW.</li>
<li><strong>WasteWise Program:</strong> EPA works with businesses, governments, and nonprofit organizations <a href="https://www.epa.gov/smm/wastewise">to promote the use and reuse of materials</a> more productively over their entire life cycles. Partners demonstrate how they reduce waste, practice environmental stewardship and incorporate sustainable materials management into their business model, including their waste-handling processes.</li>
<li><strong>Trash Free Waters</strong> is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters">a voluntary program</a> that emphasizes stakeholder engagement to assist U.S. and international communities with addressing primarily land-based sources of marine litter. Within the United States, there have been more than 200 place-based projects that have been or are being implemented.
<ul>
<li><a class="external-link" href="https://www.epa.gov/international-cooperation/trash-free-waters-tfw-international-implementation-guide#:~:text=The%20Trash%20Free%20Waters%20(TFW,based%20sources%20of%20marine%20litter" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">The Trash Free Waters International Implementation Guide</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a> – a tool that provides step-by-step guidance for including all stakeholders, either at the national, state, or community level in decision-making to address land-based sources of marine litter.</li>
<li><a class="external-link" href="https://www.epa.gov/international-cooperation/solid-waste-management-guide-developing-countries" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">Best Practices for Solid Waste Management: A Guide for Decision-Makers in Developing Countries</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a> – The Guide covers a diverse set of important topics for city-level decision-makers around the world<u>,</u> including stakeholder engagement, waste management planning and economics, waste collection and transportation, prevention, minimization, and recycling, landfill design and operation, and energy recovery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DOE launched the <strong>Plastics Innovation Challenge</strong> in 2018 to coordinate the many initiatives across the department on plastic recycling, degradation, upcycling, and design for circularity. The goals of this program are to develop solutions that deliver greater than 50 percent energy savings, address greater than 90 percent of plastics, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than50 percent, and achieve at least 75 percent carbon utilization.  The work includes solving fundamental science challenges through research projects and Energy Frontier Research Centers, forging public-private partnerships such as the <strong>BOTTLE Consortia</strong> (<a href="http://www.bottle.org/">bottle.org</a>) and the <strong>REMADE</strong> Institute, and working with industry partners to reduce plastic waste through the <strong>Better Plants Program</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>USDA offers support and programs to increase the research, development and buyer/consumer awareness of bioplastics. <strong>Agricultural Research Service </strong>scientists developed a way for crop residues from cornstalks, straw, and sugarcane bagasse, combined with sustainable enzymes, to convert crop-derived sugars into compounds used in the sustainable manufacture of nylon plastics.  USDA’s <strong>BioPreferred Program</strong> works to increase the purchase and use of biobased products through federal procurement and a certification and labeling initiative.  The program’s USDA <strong>Certified Biobased Product </strong>label is a market development initiative to increase consumer and buyer recognition, and the purchase of bioproducts.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Today the United States joins the UN Human Rights Council at the Council’s 49th regular session.  The U.S. return to that body fulfills a pledge made by President Biden and reflects the centrality of human rights to our nation’s foreign policy. The timing of this session could not be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Since the opening moments of Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine, reports of human rights abuses have been widespread.  Let there be no confusion:  Russia attacked Ukraine because Ukraine dared to pursue a democratic path.  Russia’s invasion has damaged and destroyed schools, hospitals, radio stations, and homes, killing and injuring civilians, including children.</p>
<p>On March 1, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will deliver remarks to the assembled Council and will use that opportunity to spell out clearly the threat posed by Russia, while noting that Ukraine is far from the only part of the world where the Council’s attention is needed.</p>
<p>Events in Ukraine only underscore the crucial importance of a credible human rights body dedicated to promoting the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and documenting human rights violations and abuses.</p>
<p>U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva Ambassador Sheba Crocker will head the U.S. delegation at this session, supported by recently confirmed Ambassador to the UN Human Rights Council Michèle Taylor.  Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights Uzra Zeya will join the delegation in Geneva February 28-March 1 for meetings with high-level counterparts and international humanitarian partners.</p>

<p>On March 1, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will deliver remarks to the assembled Council and will use that opportunity to spell out clearly the threat posed by Russia, while noting that Ukraine is far from the only part of the world where the Council’s attention is needed.</p>
<p>Events in Ukraine only underscore the crucial importance of a credible human rights body dedicated to promoting the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and documenting human rights violations and abuses.</p>
<p>U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva Ambassador Sheba Crocker will head the U.S. delegation at this session, supported by recently confirmed Ambassador to the UN Human Rights Council Michèle Taylor.  Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights Uzra Zeya will join the delegation in Geneva February 28-March 1 for meetings with high-level counterparts and international humanitarian partners.</p>
