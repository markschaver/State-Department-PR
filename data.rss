					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:13 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon. Happy Tuesday. A couple items at the top and then we’ll turn right to your questions.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-BURMA"></a> First, I want to call your attention and reiterate what U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in her written statement related to recent arrests made in the alleged plot targeting Burma’s permanent representative to the United Nations.</p>
<p>We are grateful, as she said, that law enforcement moved swiftly to respond to the horrific alleged plot to seriously injure or kill Burma’s permanent representative to the UN. The United States stands in solidarity with Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, who continues to demonstrate remarkable courage and bravery in speaking on behalf of the people of Burma who demand a return to democracy.</p>
<p>We are grateful this alleged plot, which was to have taken place on U.S. soil, was thwarted and that the suspected perpetrators were arrested and are now facing justice.</p>
<p>We unequivocally condemn this threat to Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, which fits a disturbing pattern of authoritarian leaders and their supporters reaching across the globe – including even into the United States – to persecute and repress journalists, activists, and others who dare speak or stand against them.</p>
<p>These acts of transnational repression must be met with the condemnation of the world and with full and certain accountability.</p>
<p>We will not stand for efforts by authoritarian regimes and their supporters and enablers to repress people on our soil or across borders, and we will continue to coordinate with allies and partners to stand against transnational repression everywhere.</p>
<p>And today, during her official visit to Thailand, U.S. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield announced more than $50 million in critical humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma, including for those forced to flee violence and persecution in the wake of the military coup.</p>
<p>This aid, provided by the State Department and USAID, will enable our international and NGO partners to provide emergency food assistance, life-saving protection, shelter, essential health care, water, sanitation, and hygiene services to the people of Burma.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-COVID"></a> In addition, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield announced $5 million in aid to help Thailand fight COVID-19.</p>
<p>This funding comes at a critical point of rising humanitarian needs, and will help mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on the lives of people of both Thailand and Burma.</p>
<p>We continue to urge other donors to generously support the urgent humanitarian needs of the people of Burma and to support the global efforts to combat COVID-19.</p>
<p>With that, I am happy to turn to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks. Sorry, I was late. I was on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Just in time.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-DEPARTMENT"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Just in time. I have a – one housekeeping item that I want to start with and then go to Afghanistan. It&#8217;s now been a little bit over two weeks – 15 days, I think – since the swastika was discovered in the elevator. Secretary came out, obviously condemned it, said there would be an investigation into it. What&#8217;s the result of the investigation?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, Matt, as you know, shortly after the swastika was discovered, the Secretary sent a note to the entire workforce. And he made clear in that note that hate has no home here. And nowhere is that tolerated, everywhere is it abhorrent, but here in this department, the – a department that stands for defending human rights, human dignity, the values of pluralism and inclusion around the world, that symbol is especially repugnant, and repugnant to the women and men of the department and to everyone who works here.</p>
<p>In the days after – and you heard directly from Secretary Blinken, I guess it was a week ago yesterday, on this – of course, President Biden has put forward a nominee for a special envoy to combat anti-Semitism, put forward a nominee for – to be an envoy for international religious freedom. And as Secretary Blinken noted in his message to the workforce, there is an investigation underway. I know this is a priority on the part of the investigators who are looking closely into this. I don&#8217;t have an update that I&#8217;m able to provide at the time, but if and when we do, I will certainly be able give you that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, far be it from me to say that something is taking a long time or not taking a long time, because I – but an elevator is a pretty small place, right? This building has got controlled access. It would seem to me that two weeks is more than enough to come up with a – to come up with some kind of explanation. And while you&#8217;re correct in saying that this kind of hate has no place and that the Secretary said that, this building also stands for accountability and transparency. So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Absolutely. Absolutely. And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So are you really telling me that two weeks after the fact, they can&#8217;t – they got no leads &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>The elevator is a small place. This building, as you know, is a large place.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah, but it’s not that big, Ned. Come on. It’s not that big. All right. If you don&#8217;t have anything, you don&#8217;t have anything.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I don’t have anything to offer now, but we &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>All right, let’s go on &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>&#8212; of course, do believe in the value of transparency. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re out here every day.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>And, of course, as soon as we have an update, we&#8217;ll be able to share that.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-AFGHANISTAN"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. Okay. On Afghanistan, I just want to make – get – does this administration believe that the Taliban is upholding its end of the deal that was signed in February 2020, the end of February 2020, in Doha?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So let me take a step back and offer some broader context, and I will come to that. I take it you&#8217;re coming at this question in light of the escalating violence and Taliban aggression.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, no, no. No reason at all.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay, okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, no. (Laughter.) It just occurred to me out of thin air.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So let me first comment on that and then we’ll come to it. The – what we are seeing – what we have seen in recent days and recent weeks – the violence, the loss of life, the aggression – it is of grave concern. It is of grave concern to this department. It is of grave concern to the entire United States Government. What we are doing around the clock is seeking to find a way out of this, and here in this department, in the Department of State, we are focused on the diplomacy that can eventually see a just and durable solution to this conflict.</p>
<p>And as part of that – the latest example of that diplomacy, as we announced last night – Ambassador Khalilzad is currently in Doha. He is there to advance a collective international response to what can only be termed as a rapidly deteriorating security situation. He will and has already taken part in several rounds of planned meetings in the coming days. Those meetings, including one today, have and will include representatives from the region as well as beyond and from multilateral organizations to press for a reduction in this violence and a ceasefire and commitment by the part of these regional and broader governments and multilateral and international institutions not to recognize any government that is imposed by force.</p>
<p>And this is something that – you’ve heard me say this recently, but it is not just our contention that any government that comes to power in Afghanistan at the barrel of a gun will lack international support and international legitimacy. It is, in fact, the consensus that has emerged and that has been stated any number of times. Just last week, the UN Security Council put out a statement, the final line of which said, “The members of the Security Council recall Resolution 2513, reaffirm that there is no military solution to the conflict, and declare that they do not support the restoration of the Islamic Emirate.” I went through last week a litany of countries, of international blocs and institutions that have signed on to this, this simple proposition that any government that comes to force in Afghanistan will lack legitimacy and, more practically, won’t have that international assistance that any government would almost certainly need to achieve any degree of durability.</p>
<p>So that is what Ambassador Khalilzad is there to seek to advance and seek to support. He will press the Taliban to stop their military offensive and to negotiate a political settlement. We, again, know that is the only path to stability, to development in Afghanistan. We also know the opposite is true, that if this violence continues, if the Taliban continues down this path, we are likely to see a prolonged, protracted period of violence, of instability. And that is not in anyone’s interest – certainly not in the interests of the people of Afghanistan and not in the interests of what the Taliban seek.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, I – yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Now, coming back to your original question, the U.S.-Taliban agreement – the application of it has been uneven. We have always – we have consistently said violence in Afghanistan – and this is perhaps clearer than it’s ever been – levels of violence are unacceptably high. That is true.</p>
<p>What is also true is that the Taliban has adhered to an important part of the U.S.-Taliban agreement.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But have they adhered to the whole thing?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What we’ve consistently said is that levels of violence are unacceptably high. But &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, if they haven’t adhered to the whole thing, do you have any recourse? Well, first of all, do you think that they are following their commitments, or are they in violation of that agreement? What’s happening right now on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The levels of violence are unacceptably high. What’s happening on the ground &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But that – that means nothing. Is that a violation?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; is unacceptable and is – it is not in the spirit &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Does that violate the deal that Zal negotiated? You’ve got him back there now, and if the Taliban are in violation of the agreement that they signed with him in – and Secretary Pompeo in February 2020, then why would you ever believe that they are – that anything that he could do there now would make any difference on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> There &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But the – the main question is: Are they violating the February 2020 agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Certainly the levels of violence do not appear consistent with what the Taliban pledged in that agreement. Let me make another point, though: There is another important element to that deal that is important for two reasons, and that, of course, is the proviso that they not target U.S. or coalition forces. The Taliban had not done so. That part of the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So they’re adhering to that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That part of the agreement &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So are they in violation of any other part of the agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> But let me &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> It’s a very easy question, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let me get to why that’s important. That’s important for a couple reasons.</p>
<p>One, it suggests because the same people on the Taliban side and the same people on our side who negotiated that 2020 agreement are – have been engaged in dialogue, engaged in discussion. And so the fact that an important element of the U.S.-Taliban agreement has been upheld suggests that, contrary to some speculation, what happens in Doha does have an impact on the ground in Afghanistan. It does suggest that there is room for diplomatic progress to be made. And that is what we are seeking to do. We are going to exhaust every diplomatic avenue, because we know the stakes if we fail to do that. The Afghan people know the stakes if there is not a negotiated agreement and a ceasefire that is put in place.</p>
<p>But there’s another reason that element of the U.S.-Taliban agreement is noteworthy, and this gets back to the decision that you heard directly from President Biden. The idea that the United States could have maintained a significant military presence in Afghanistan and that we would have found and encountered conditions that were just as we would have found them on April 30th of this year going into May 1 or May 2nd – that was just not tenable. It was not in the cards, and it was not in the cards because, according to that agreement that was negotiated by the United States – not this administration, but the previous one – if our forces remain there in great numbers after May 1, they could again have become targets of violence.</p>
<p>This President places great priority – the greatest priority – on the safety, the security, the well-being of our service members. So the idea that a force of a couple thousand U.S. military service members either would have been able to remain in Afghanistan with the status quo, or frankly that a force of that size would have been able to stand in the way of what we are seeing now – both of those propositions are hollow, and they’re hollow for the very simple reason that &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> They’re also unprovable. And I’ll stop, so – other people have questions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Follow-up, or joint &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Follow-up on Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> An EU official has said the Taliban now controls 65 percent of Afghanistan. Given its rapid takeover, is there any hesitancy or second thoughts with the U.S. thinking over Turkey’s effort to run the Kabul airport?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Taking – Turkey’s efforts to run the Kabul effort – airport?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The – what that gets to, what the Kabul airport represents, is something more than – you might say most airports – it’s more about – it’s more than air travel; it’s more than commercial travel, certainly. A secure, operational airport we feel is integral to our ability to have a functioning diplomatic presence on the ground. So the safety, the security, the continuing operation of that airport – it is of high importance to us. We are grateful that our Turkish partners have indicated a willingness to play a role in protecting that. Of course, Afghan Security Forces have an important role to play, too. But nothing that we have seen diminishes the importance we place on a functioning, safe, secure Hamid Karzai International Airport.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Have you picked up any hesitancy from the Turks on this issue?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> This is an issue that we have discussed, including at the highest levels, with our Turkish allies. President Biden, of course, discussed it with his counterpart, with President Erdogan. The department has discussed it in multiple levels. It is now principally a discussion that the Department of Defense is leading. As we always do, we keep those discussions in confidence, but we do appreciate Turkey’s willingness to take on an important role.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Following up &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; thank you – following up on the U.S.-Taliban agreement. Isn’t – to be more specific and try to get an answer – isn’t the Taliban violating the commitment not to attack cities and towns that was in the annexes of that agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That gets back to what we have consistently said. Levels of violence are too high. They are unacceptably high. That is why we are focused on diminishing the level of violence. We are doing this diplomatically; the State Department certainly is. But of course, the Afghans have a role to play, an important role to play – perhaps a more important role than they have had to play over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>And the other point is that yes, the Taliban have made gains; yes, the Taliban has inflicted horrific violence on their country, killing their fellow countrymen and women in the process, seemingly indiscriminately. At the same time – we’ve made this point before, but – the Afghan Government, the Afghan National Security Forces, far outnumber the Taliban – 300,000 – a capable fighting force of 300,000 troops, an air force that has modern weaponry, that has been trained by the United States, that just recently was provided with additional equipment. They have special forces. They have heavy equipment. So they have a capable fighting force.</p>
<p>For our part, we continue to support Afghan Security Forces. We’re committed to supporting those forces well into the future. You just look at what President Biden has requested in his budget request – $3.3 billion for the support of the Afghan Security Forces. That is a clear indication of our continuing support well into the future for these Afghan National Security Forces.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Was the withdrawal of the U.S. forces a condition-based withdrawal, and if yes, would you say that the Taliban are respecting their conditions of the withdrawal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Was our withdrawal conditions-based?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> No. Our withdrawal is not conditions-based, for the simple reason that it was preordained that a conditions-based withdrawal was essentially taken off the table. This administration could not – this President &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So why make a deal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So why make a deal if there was no conditions to the withdrawal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The deal closed the door on a conditions-based withdrawal. It’s a very important point. The U.S.-Taliban agreement stipulates a number of things. Among those things that it stipulates is that on May 1st of this year the United States was to withdraw its military forces. This was an agreement that was concluded in early 2020, a year before this administration came in. It was an agreement that – as President Biden said when he announced the military withdrawal, it’s a deal that this administration probably would not have made, certainly not in all the detail. But it’s a deal that we inherited.</p>
<p>And so that gets back to the point that it was never an option for the United States to maintain its forces. Or I should say it was never a viable option for this President, a president who prioritizes the safety, the security, the well-being of our service members, to maintain forces there in significant numbers after May 1, knowing that the status quo would not stand after May 1. From April 30th to May 1st, our service members would have become – could have become, once again – targets of violence. And that is something that had not happened since the U.S.-Taliban agreement. That was not a proposition this President, this administration, was willing to accept.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one last on Afghanistan for me. You’ve been issuing the same warnings to the Taliban for the last several days and weeks. They haven’t heard any of it. What makes you think that they will change their course now that they’re gaining and gaining cities and capitals?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Look, we have been very clear where we stand, but also where the international community stands. You’re seeing this reflected right now in Qatar, where the Qataris are hosting a series of meetings involving much of the region, much of the international community, to discuss and to ultimately advance this diplomatic project.</p>
<p>I think there’s also a misconception that in order for negotiations, peace negotiations, to take place there is the requirement that there be peace on the ground. In fact, if you look back through history, very rarely have peace negotiations taken place when peace is present on the ground. What we’re seeing is levels of violence that are of grave concern. They’re certainly not within the spirt of the U.S.-Taliban agreement. But we know that diplomacy is the only way that we are ever going to achieve a durable solution and, insofar as we are concerned, a just solution.</p>
<p>And so we have made very clear that in order for us and for our allies and partners to be able to recognize any future government of Afghanistan and to provide assistance to it, it must emerge from a political settlement that meets five criteria. First, it must be inclusive; second, it must respect the rights of all Afghans, including women and minorities; third, it allows the Afghan people to have a say in choosing their leaders; fourth, it must prevent Afghan soil from being used to threaten the United States and its allies and partners; and fifth and finally, it must respect its commitments in terms of international law and international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>We’ve made these criteria very clear to the Taliban. President Ghani, Chairman Abdullah have accepted these criteria for their part. We have discussed these criteria with our allies and partners. And for us, this will be the roadmap for recognition and for assistance to any future government of Afghanistan. It’s not – again, not just us. It is the countries in the region and well beyond that espouse this.</p>
<p>Nick.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, just a quick follow-up. So is there any circumstance under which the administration would consider stopping or reversing the troop withdrawal? Is there anything that the Taliban could do that would force this administration to do that, or are troops coming out no matter what?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, this gets back to I think what we were talking about before, but let me just say: Every commander in chief faces difficult choices. That’s really the nature of the role of commander in chief. If something reaches the desk of the president of the United States, any number of hundreds or thousands of people have probably mulled it over before with some degree of lack of consensus or consternation. President Biden made a very tough decision. He was clear that after 20 years of conflict, after our service members had accomplished the task that had been asked of them initially – the decimation of the network responsible for the 9/11 attacks, bringing Osama bin Laden to justice over 10 years ago – it was time for our troops to come home.</p>
<p>But the other relevant piece of this is that it gets back to what was in some ways preordained. The status quo was not an option. If we had announced a plan to extend our military presence or sustain it indefinitely, there was a risk, a not insignificant risk, that our service members would once again become the attempted targets of Taliban attacks and Taliban offensives.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>But so in – I mean, in other words, what you seem to be saying is that it&#8217;s okay if the Taliban don&#8217;t abide by their part of the deal because you&#8217;re acknowledging that there&#8217;s – the levels of violence are too high, but then at the same time, you&#8217;re saying listen, we had to abide by our promises under this deal, even if the Taliban did not abide by their promises.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, what we&#8217;re saying is that President Biden decided very firmly that our military service members would not be bargaining chips, that their lives would not be used as leverage for what we would all hope and seek to achieve in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So are you then – I mean, okay – I mean, the U.S. maintains troop presences in countries all over the world indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I would caution against comparing what U.S. forces Korea face and what our service members in Afghanistan would have endured after May.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. So the – the final question for me, then, is – I mean, are – is there an assessment now in the administration that essentially the process of the peace negotiation with the U.S. was essentially a gambit by the Taliban to get U.S. troops out, and once U.S. troops out – were out, they recognize that you would have no leverage to stop their advance, which seems to be exactly what happening? I mean, do you still believe that they negotiated with you guys in good faith?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, of course, this agreement was concluded in 2020, so – with the U.S. Government, of course, and that&#8217;s why – one of the reasons why it was important to honor it. But look, the idea that we don&#8217;t have leverage or that the Islamic Republic, the Government of Afghanistan doesn&#8217;t have leverage – that&#8217;s just not the case. The United States continues to have leverage, our – the international community, working closely with us, continues to have leverage, and the Afghan Government has tremendous leverage. Part of that is the numerical advantage that I spoke to before: 300,000 troops, an air force, special forces, heavy equipment, training, a commitment of partnership, continued support from the United States, $3.3 billion in the budget for continuing support to the ANDSF.</p>
<p>So the idea that the Taliban advance – continued Taliban advance is unstoppable, that there&#8217;s nothing that can stand in the way, that we&#8217;ll just have to watch it unfold, that is not the reality on the ground.</p>
<p>Conor.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Can I just follow up on that, and two other questions? You can&#8217;t compare the situation maybe to South Korea, but we have U.S. troops in Iraq who are under near-constant rocket fire as well. And they&#8217;re there to keep the situation stable against ISIS, a terror group. So how is that any different from what&#8217;s happening in Afghanistan, and why pull U.S. troops out from one country but leave them in another?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>It&#8217;s very difficult and dare I say impossible to compare one country to the next. You&#8217;re right that U.S. service members are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi Government in order – for one mission and one mission only, and that is in partnership for the counter-ISIS mission. We have similarly, when it comes to Afghanistan, been very clear – and this is one of our criteria that we have made clear to the Taliban; the President has made this clear to the American people and the international public – that we are determined that Afghanistan will never again become a staging ground for attacks against the United States. We believe and we are confident that we can do that through resources and capabilities that are so-called over the horizon, that aren&#8217;t stationed in Afghanistan but that we can call upon at a moment&#8217;s notice to disrupt a threat as it emerges.</p>
<p>The fact is that the security risks, that the danger that our service members would have been exposed to after May 1, when the Taliban would have deemed us to have been in violation of that agreement and our service members would once again – could well have once again become targets of attack, that is not a proposition this President was willing to accept. It wasn&#8217;t a proposition because this President prioritizes the security, the safety, the well-being of our service members, but this &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But why is that a proposition you’re willing to accept in Iraq, then, where they are under constant threat from rocket attacks as well?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The dynamic is entirely different. There is not an analogous situation on the ground. There is not an analogous agreement that was reached between – and even the idea of it sounds laughable – between the United States Government and ISIS. There is no analogous U.S.-ISIS agreement.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible.) It was – it was pretty laughable not so many years ago that there would ever be a deal between the U.S. and the Taliban.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just a second question, then.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You talk consistently about the Taliban paying a cost in the future, that they would be an international pariah, there would be no international assistance. Why haven’t you imposed the costs on the Taliban now for what’s happening? Why haven’t you imposed some sort of costs on their leadership for the atrocities that you say that their group is committing, for the ongoing offensive?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. It’s a good question. All tools – we have not taken any tool off the table except for this military presence on the ground. The Afghan Government continues to have a capable and highly numerically superior fighting force. They are imposing costs. They have the potential to impose even greater costs on the Taliban. Of course, there are other tools at our disposal that fall short of reintroducing U.S. forces. We have not ruled any of those out, and so if it’s appropriate for us to use them, we won’t hesitate to do so.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one last question: It’s three weeks now until the military withdrawal is supposed to be complete. The administration has committed to relocating 4,000 Afghan SIVs and their families, and that process hasn’t started. Do you realistically think – for the 4,000 who are going to third countries, do you realistically think that that is possible to complete within the next three weeks?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What the President said is that relocation flights would begin by the end of last month, and they did for this first group of SIV applicants. And let me just give you an update on that, because I know there’s great interest in this. So far, as of today, six flights have landed in the United States. We have relocated almost a thousand special immigrants and their family members as of August 10th. That number is, in fact, 995, so when we say almost, we mean almost. We are, of course, unable to preview upcoming flight schedules, but we expect to surpass that 1,000 number very shortly.</p>
<p>To date, approximately 60 percent of the Afghan special immigrants who arrived at Fort Lee have departed Fort Lee to begin their new lives in the United States with assistance from the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.</p>
<p>Let me mention one other point, because this will be important as to processing going forward: The State Department can now accept results of the so-called fit-to-fly medical exam that Afghan special immigrants participating in Operation Allies Refuge relocation flights must undergo for purposes of visa issuance. And so this accommodation has made it possible for more applicants to enter the United States with a visa in hand, conferring upon them lawful permanent residence status upon admission to the United States as a first-time arriving immigrant, and therefore negating the need for them to undergo additional processing at Fort Lee.</p>
<p>So, in other words, they are undergoing elements of this fit-to-fly medical exam in Afghanistan, in Kabul before they board, and so that will expedite their processing upon arrival in the United States. Many, if not most, of these special immigrants can now go directly to the relocation agencies to begin their new lives here in the United States.</p>
<p>Kylie.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just to follow up on that, so it’s 995 SIVs and their family members?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How many SIVs – like single applicants. Do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have that number, but 995 is the aggregate.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That includes the principal applicants and dependents.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And do you have any updates on flights to third countries or U.S. locations overseas?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, this is something – so as – so just to distinguish what we’re talking about, these so far 995 of the total 1,000 principal applicants, or approximately 4,000 within the group that had completed the security vetting, they are coming directly to the United States. There is a second larger group that has not completed – completed the chief of mission stage but not the security vetting. And so, as the President announced, they will be going to third countries. We have engaged a number of third countries; we’re continuing to have discussions with a number of our partners. Don’t have any details to share at this time, but as soon as we do, we will.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And then I just have one question: So we reported today that there is some active discussions underway about a further drawdown from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, and I understand it’s not going to be a major drawdown, but potentially a small drawdown is under consideration. And one thing that the department said is that the embassy in Kabul continues to pursue its full agenda of issues. And I’m just wondering, given everything that is unfolding on the ground there with the Taliban violence and gains, how the diplomacy and how the work that the embassy actually does on the ground has been impacted.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, it’s a very good question. Let me first talk about the staffing and security piece of it. As you know, in April, Embassy Kabul went on ordered departure status. That was in late April – April 27th, I believe it was. So our posture has not changed since then. What we have been doing, as we do for every diplomatic post in a challenging security environment, is to evaluate threats daily and to determine what the staffing posture that is in the best interests for those serving at the embassy and how we might be able to continue to keep them safe.</p>
<p>And so, of course, we do want to minimize the number of employees in Afghanistan whose functions can be performed elsewhere. And we spoke about this in the context of the SIV process. Instead of completing the chief of mission stage, having that processing done from Kabul, we’ve been able to do that from Washington, for example, or the Washington, D.C. area.</p>
<p>So that’s what we’re looking at, our – the point in all of this is that we intend for our partnership with the Afghan people to be enduring. In order for that to be the case, it’s important to have a diplomatic relationship and a diplomatic presence on the ground to do those functions that can’t be performed elsewhere. And there are a number of functions: the political element, the consular element that is important for that face-to-face diplomacy to take place under the auspices of our embassy.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So everything that you would like to do on the ground you’re able to do on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Obviously, it is a challenging security environment, and were we able, were we confident, were we comfortable having a larger staffing presence there, we would. But we are evaluating the threat environment on a daily basis. The embassy is in regular contact with Washington, with the most senior people in this building, who in turn are in regular contact with our colleagues at the NSC and the White House on this dynamic. But for right now, we have been able to continue those core activities that are important for us to conduct on the ground.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Sorry, if we can have a gradual break from Afghanistan &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-SOUTHKOREA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; I have a question for – so I have two questions. First one is State Department’s willingness to promote freedom of the press outside the United States. So South Korea’s Moon government and the ruling party is pushing a new law that obliges media outlets to pay punitive damages for spreading fake news. And as you have seen in the United States, labeling critical news stories as fake news is a typical way of attempting to stifle criticism. So South Korean journalist associations expresses deep concern.</p>
<p>And so my question is: I understand Biden administration wants to show unity between the allies, but as the administration promotes freedom of the press and liberal democracy in the world, will the administration acquiesce this undermining of democratic values just to avoid presenting split between the allies? And if not, can you share State Department’s plan to address this issue with South Korean counterparts?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I don’t have a specific reaction to offer on this particular development, but I will say, broadly, freedom of the press, freedom of expression is a value that the United States supports the world over. And we’ve demonstrated that in the context of the Republic of Korea. When Secretary Blinken was in Seoul and he, of course, visited Tokyo and Seoul on his first physical travel overseas, we met with – he met with a number of emerging South Korean journalists – that is to say, young journalists working for some of the country’s biggest outlets – to affirm this – these enduring values and enduring principles that we share with our like-minded allies and partners. And so freedom of expression is something that we continue to stand for and will stand for in that context and every context.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So you want to avoid the specific – this mentioning about this development, but do you think there will be a private diplomatic discussion about this issue?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I wouldn’t want to wade into what may or may not be conveyed privately.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-CHINA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So my second question is Chinese nuclear buildup. So last Friday, Secretary Blinken expressed the concern that China has deviated from its past strategy of minimum deterrence. Is it now the U.S. Government’s official assessment that China has discarded no-first-use policy and shifted to launch on warning?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I’m not going to weigh in on the PRC’s nuclear doctrine. I will leave that to them. What is – what we have said and I think what is becoming more and more obvious is that the PRC is building a larger and more diverse nuclear arsenal. Despite efforts to obfuscate this, this rapid buildup has become more difficult to hide, and it does suggest that China is deviating from decades of nuclear strategy based around minimum deterrence.</p>
<p>These advances at the same time highlight why we believe it is important that it’s in everyone’s interests that nuclear powers talk to one another, that we engage in nonproliferation dialogue directly to discuss reducing nuclear dangers and avoiding miscalculation. We encourage Beijing to engage with us on practical measures to reduce the risks of destabilizing arms races and conflict.</p>
<p>Of course, our Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman recently engaged in a round of Strategic Stability Dialogue with the Russian Federation. And it’s important that nuclear powers – China, of course, be among them – be open to professional dialogue and discussion, precisely to reduce the risk of these weapons.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-JAPAN"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Two new question about China. First one: Yesterday, the Secretary Blinken met Japanese new national security advisor Akiba and they reaffirmed the importance of the peace and the stability in the Taiwan Strait. So what kind of specific contributions or the actions do you expect Japan to take to keeping this stability?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, stability across the strait is an important principle that not only we seek to uphold, but that we’ve discussed with our partners in the region, including Japan. For our part – and I wouldn’t want to speak to Tokyo’s approach to this; that’s for them to offer – we will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait relations, consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people on Taiwan. We have urged Beijing – and you’ve heard similar statements from our allies and partners in the Indo Pacific – to cease its military, its diplomatic, its economic pressure against Taiwan and to engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-OLYMPICS"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> One more question is about Olympics. Now that the Tokyo Olympics are over – although we still have the Paralympics – but let me ask about the current stance of the United States on participating in the next Beijing Winter Olympic Games?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, you’re right that the Tokyo Olympic Games have now concluded. Of course, the Paralympic Games are ahead of us. But it is still mid-2021 – August is still mid, I suppose – so we are not – don’t want to wade in just yet on 2022 Olympics. We are, as we have said, consulting closely with our allies and partners to, in the first instance, define those common concerns and to establish a shared approach. But again, I don’t want to get ahead of where we are, given that we still have some time to go.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> North Korea?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Six months.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Six months away. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. And also mid-2021? Eight out of twelve is not exactly mid. You know, you’re on the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Math was never my forte. But you get the point.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-NORTHKOREA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On North Korea, do you have any response to the comment from Kim Jong-un’s sister about the U.S.-South Korea military exercise, calling Seoul “perfidious” yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have a specific response to the North Korean comments, but allow me to offer just a bit of context and – surrounding the policy from our side. First, let me reiterate that the joint military exercises are purely defensive in nature. We have made that point repeatedly, and it’s a very important one.</p>
<p>Second, as we have long maintained, the United States harbors no hostile intent towards the DPRK. We remain committed to the security of the Republic of Korea and our combined defense posture in accordance with our ironclad U.S.-ROK alliance. DOD may be able to provide additional details on these exercises, but the important point for us is that they are purely defensive in nature.</p>
<p>More broadly, and as we’ve said in recent weeks, we support inter-Korean dialogue. We support inter-Korean engagement, and we’ll continue to work with our ROK partners towards that end.</p>
<p>Yes. Let’s see, anyone who hasn’t – John, yeah.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-ETHIOPIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, on Ethiopia. The prime minister is now calling for a national war effort and mass enlistment in response to battlefield losses to Tigray rebels. Does the administration have any response, coming just a week after Samantha Power was in the country calling for a ceasefire?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, that continues to be our message. You heard it very forcefully. Ethiopian officials heard it very frankly from Ambassador Power. We have continued to call for dialogue and a cessation of hostilities. That is precisely what Ambassador Power said during her visit last week. During her visit last week, she also made the point during her press conference that enflamed rhetoric makes it more difficult for all parties to come to the table and negotiate an end to this conflict. The focus, as we see it, should be and must be on dialogue that is needed for an inclusive peace and importantly to end the suffering of the civilian people of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Kylie.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-LITHUANIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m just wondering, on this China and Lithuania situation, do you guys have anything to say about China now demanding that Lithuania withdraw its ambassador from Beijing, after they opened this office, the Taiwan embassy?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we do stand in solidarity with our NATO Ally Lithuania and we condemn the PRC’s recent retaliatory actions, including the recall of Beijing’s ambassador from Vilnius and demanding Lithuania recall its ambassador from Beijing. We support our European partners and our allies as they develop mutually beneficial relations with Taiwan and resist the PRC’s coercive behavior. Taiwan is a global leader in public health and advanced manufacturing and democratic governance, to name just a few areas in which the international community – including the United States – benefits from engagement with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Each country should be able to determine the contours of its own “one China” policy without outside coercion. We have done just that. Of course, we have spoken to how this administration is engaging with the people on Taiwan in accord with our “one China” policy. But for further details on this, I would refer you to the Government of Lithuania.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And I just – I assume therefore that you support, if other countries are considering opening Taiwan embassies in their country, if they want to do that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We support engagement.</p>
<p>I’ll – we’ll do Tracy, and then Daphne.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-CHINAISRAEL"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, thank you. Since we’re back on China, do you have any comment on or knowledge of, or better yet, confirmation of China’s supposed cyber-attack on Israel?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have anything for you on that. Of course, we have seen and we have taken action against China’s – the PRC’s malign activity in cyberspace. We have taken actions to attribute even just recently when it comes to the attack against the Microsoft Exchange Server, and the details of that attribution we made public. But when – and of course, DOJ has previously charged PRC officials for activities, malign activities in the cyber realm, but I don’t have a specific response on that for you.</p>
<p>Daphne.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-BURMA2"></a><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>A collection of more than 90 organizations have written to Secretary Blinken urging him to recognize the atrocities committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar as crimes against humanity and genocide.  You’ve been in office for nearly eight months now; why is the review of this determination taking so long?  And then is this a policy question rather than just looking at the facts?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So you heard – and I believe you asked Secretary Blinken for an update when he was here just a couple weeks ago. He said at the time that that evaluation of the facts and the law is ongoing. Of course, it’s important that we have a full understanding of the facts, of the law, and also the implications when it comes to any sort of designation.</p>
<p>What remains true, and what we’ve said before, is that many of the individuals who are now in leadership positions within the junta are and were responsible for the – for some of the alleged atrocities against the Rohingya. We continue to believe that they should be held to account for that, for their anti-democratic practices more recently, and we will continue to find ways to do just that. But I don’t have an update to offer on any – on that particular determination.</p>
<p>Conor.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Follow-up, related on Myanmar. Last week, Wendy Sherman had a phone call with Zin Mar, who is the sort of acting foreign minister of the National Unity Government. Should this be taken as a sign that the Biden administration is considering recognizing the NUG as the legitimate government in Myanmar?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what we’ve said is that we engage with – first of all, we are standing with the people of Burma, who very clearly still aspire to see their democracy restored. As part of our strong support for the people of Burma, we are engaging with the full range of civil society and pro-democracy groups that seek to do that, that seek to restore democratic governance.</p>
<p>To date, it has not only been Deputy Secretary Sherman but EAP bureau leadership and our U.S. ambassador to Burma. They’ve met with NUG leaders. We continue to deepen such engagement. When Deputy Secretary Sherman spoke to Zin Mar Aung last week, they discussed ongoing efforts to return Burma to a path to democracy, including continued U.S. support for the pro-democracy movement. They also discussed the toll of COVID-19 in Burma and efforts to provide critical humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma.</p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 3:06 p.m.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:13 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon. Happy Tuesday. A couple items at the top and then we’ll turn right to your questions.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-BURMA"></a> First, I want to call your attention and reiterate what U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in her written statement related to recent arrests made in the alleged plot targeting Burma’s permanent representative to the United Nations.</p>
<p>We are grateful, as she said, that law enforcement moved swiftly to respond to the horrific alleged plot to seriously injure or kill Burma’s permanent representative to the UN. The United States stands in solidarity with Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, who continues to demonstrate remarkable courage and bravery in speaking on behalf of the people of Burma who demand a return to democracy.</p>
<p>We are grateful this alleged plot, which was to have taken place on U.S. soil, was thwarted and that the suspected perpetrators were arrested and are now facing justice.</p>
<p>We unequivocally condemn this threat to Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, which fits a disturbing pattern of authoritarian leaders and their supporters reaching across the globe – including even into the United States – to persecute and repress journalists, activists, and others who dare speak or stand against them.</p>
<p>These acts of transnational repression must be met with the condemnation of the world and with full and certain accountability.</p>
<p>We will not stand for efforts by authoritarian regimes and their supporters and enablers to repress people on our soil or across borders, and we will continue to coordinate with allies and partners to stand against transnational repression everywhere.</p>
<p>And today, during her official visit to Thailand, U.S. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield announced more than $50 million in critical humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma, including for those forced to flee violence and persecution in the wake of the military coup.</p>
<p>This aid, provided by the State Department and USAID, will enable our international and NGO partners to provide emergency food assistance, life-saving protection, shelter, essential health care, water, sanitation, and hygiene services to the people of Burma.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-COVID"></a> In addition, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield announced $5 million in aid to help Thailand fight COVID-19.</p>
<p>This funding comes at a critical point of rising humanitarian needs, and will help mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on the lives of people of both Thailand and Burma.</p>
<p>We continue to urge other donors to generously support the urgent humanitarian needs of the people of Burma and to support the global efforts to combat COVID-19.</p>
<p>With that, I am happy to turn to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks. Sorry, I was late. I was on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Just in time.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-DEPARTMENT"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Just in time. I have a – one housekeeping item that I want to start with and then go to Afghanistan. It&#8217;s now been a little bit over two weeks – 15 days, I think – since the swastika was discovered in the elevator. Secretary came out, obviously condemned it, said there would be an investigation into it. What&#8217;s the result of the investigation?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, Matt, as you know, shortly after the swastika was discovered, the Secretary sent a note to the entire workforce. And he made clear in that note that hate has no home here. And nowhere is that tolerated, everywhere is it abhorrent, but here in this department, the – a department that stands for defending human rights, human dignity, the values of pluralism and inclusion around the world, that symbol is especially repugnant, and repugnant to the women and men of the department and to everyone who works here.</p>
<p>In the days after – and you heard directly from Secretary Blinken, I guess it was a week ago yesterday, on this – of course, President Biden has put forward a nominee for a special envoy to combat anti-Semitism, put forward a nominee for – to be an envoy for international religious freedom. And as Secretary Blinken noted in his message to the workforce, there is an investigation underway. I know this is a priority on the part of the investigators who are looking closely into this. I don&#8217;t have an update that I&#8217;m able to provide at the time, but if and when we do, I will certainly be able give you that.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Well, far be it from me to say that something is taking a long time or not taking a long time, because I – but an elevator is a pretty small place, right? This building has got controlled access. It would seem to me that two weeks is more than enough to come up with a – to come up with some kind of explanation. And while you&#8217;re correct in saying that this kind of hate has no place and that the Secretary said that, this building also stands for accountability and transparency. So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Absolutely. Absolutely. And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So are you really telling me that two weeks after the fact, they can&#8217;t – they got no leads &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>The elevator is a small place. This building, as you know, is a large place.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yeah, but it’s not that big, Ned. Come on. It’s not that big. All right. If you don&#8217;t have anything, you don&#8217;t have anything.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I don’t have anything to offer now, but we &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>All right, let’s go on &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>&#8212; of course, do believe in the value of transparency. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re out here every day.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>And, of course, as soon as we have an update, we&#8217;ll be able to share that.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-AFGHANISTAN"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. Okay. On Afghanistan, I just want to make – get – does this administration believe that the Taliban is upholding its end of the deal that was signed in February 2020, the end of February 2020, in Doha?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So let me take a step back and offer some broader context, and I will come to that. I take it you&#8217;re coming at this question in light of the escalating violence and Taliban aggression.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, no, no. No reason at all.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay, okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> No, no. (Laughter.) It just occurred to me out of thin air.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So let me first comment on that and then we’ll come to it. The – what we are seeing – what we have seen in recent days and recent weeks – the violence, the loss of life, the aggression – it is of grave concern. It is of grave concern to this department. It is of grave concern to the entire United States Government. What we are doing around the clock is seeking to find a way out of this, and here in this department, in the Department of State, we are focused on the diplomacy that can eventually see a just and durable solution to this conflict.</p>
<p>And as part of that – the latest example of that diplomacy, as we announced last night – Ambassador Khalilzad is currently in Doha. He is there to advance a collective international response to what can only be termed as a rapidly deteriorating security situation. He will and has already taken part in several rounds of planned meetings in the coming days. Those meetings, including one today, have and will include representatives from the region as well as beyond and from multilateral organizations to press for a reduction in this violence and a ceasefire and commitment by the part of these regional and broader governments and multilateral and international institutions not to recognize any government that is imposed by force.</p>
<p>And this is something that – you’ve heard me say this recently, but it is not just our contention that any government that comes to power in Afghanistan at the barrel of a gun will lack international support and international legitimacy. It is, in fact, the consensus that has emerged and that has been stated any number of times. Just last week, the UN Security Council put out a statement, the final line of which said, “The members of the Security Council recall Resolution 2513, reaffirm that there is no military solution to the conflict, and declare that they do not support the restoration of the Islamic Emirate.” I went through last week a litany of countries, of international blocs and institutions that have signed on to this, this simple proposition that any government that comes to force in Afghanistan will lack legitimacy and, more practically, won’t have that international assistance that any government would almost certainly need to achieve any degree of durability.</p>
<p>So that is what Ambassador Khalilzad is there to seek to advance and seek to support. He will press the Taliban to stop their military offensive and to negotiate a political settlement. We, again, know that is the only path to stability, to development in Afghanistan. We also know the opposite is true, that if this violence continues, if the Taliban continues down this path, we are likely to see a prolonged, protracted period of violence, of instability. And that is not in anyone’s interest – certainly not in the interests of the people of Afghanistan and not in the interests of what the Taliban seek.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, I – yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Now, coming back to your original question, the U.S.-Taliban agreement – the application of it has been uneven. We have always – we have consistently said violence in Afghanistan – and this is perhaps clearer than it’s ever been – levels of violence are unacceptably high. That is true.</p>
<p>What is also true is that the Taliban has adhered to an important part of the U.S.-Taliban agreement.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But have they adhered to the whole thing?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What we’ve consistently said is that levels of violence are unacceptably high. But &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, if they haven’t adhered to the whole thing, do you have any recourse? Well, first of all, do you think that they are following their commitments, or are they in violation of that agreement? What’s happening right now on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The levels of violence are unacceptably high. What’s happening on the ground &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But that – that means nothing. Is that a violation?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; is unacceptable and is – it is not in the spirit &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Does that violate the deal that Zal negotiated? You’ve got him back there now, and if the Taliban are in violation of the agreement that they signed with him in – and Secretary Pompeo in February 2020, then why would you ever believe that they are – that anything that he could do there now would make any difference on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> There &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But the – the main question is: Are they violating the February 2020 agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Certainly the levels of violence do not appear consistent with what the Taliban pledged in that agreement. Let me make another point, though: There is another important element to that deal that is important for two reasons, and that, of course, is the proviso that they not target U.S. or coalition forces. The Taliban had not done so. That part of the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So they’re adhering to that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That part of the agreement &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So are they in violation of any other part of the agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> But let me &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> It’s a very easy question, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Let me get to why that’s important. That’s important for a couple reasons.</p>
<p>One, it suggests because the same people on the Taliban side and the same people on our side who negotiated that 2020 agreement are – have been engaged in dialogue, engaged in discussion. And so the fact that an important element of the U.S.-Taliban agreement has been upheld suggests that, contrary to some speculation, what happens in Doha does have an impact on the ground in Afghanistan. It does suggest that there is room for diplomatic progress to be made. And that is what we are seeking to do. We are going to exhaust every diplomatic avenue, because we know the stakes if we fail to do that. The Afghan people know the stakes if there is not a negotiated agreement and a ceasefire that is put in place.</p>
<p>But there’s another reason that element of the U.S.-Taliban agreement is noteworthy, and this gets back to the decision that you heard directly from President Biden. The idea that the United States could have maintained a significant military presence in Afghanistan and that we would have found and encountered conditions that were just as we would have found them on April 30th of this year going into May 1 or May 2nd – that was just not tenable. It was not in the cards, and it was not in the cards because, according to that agreement that was negotiated by the United States – not this administration, but the previous one – if our forces remain there in great numbers after May 1, they could again have become targets of violence.</p>
<p>This President places great priority – the greatest priority – on the safety, the security, the well-being of our service members. So the idea that a force of a couple thousand U.S. military service members either would have been able to remain in Afghanistan with the status quo, or frankly that a force of that size would have been able to stand in the way of what we are seeing now – both of those propositions are hollow, and they’re hollow for the very simple reason that &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> They’re also unprovable. And I’ll stop, so – other people have questions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Follow-up, or joint &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Follow-up on Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Okay. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> An EU official has said the Taliban now controls 65 percent of Afghanistan. Given its rapid takeover, is there any hesitancy or second thoughts with the U.S. thinking over Turkey’s effort to run the Kabul airport?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Taking – Turkey’s efforts to run the Kabul effort – airport?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The – what that gets to, what the Kabul airport represents, is something more than – you might say most airports – it’s more about – it’s more than air travel; it’s more than commercial travel, certainly. A secure, operational airport we feel is integral to our ability to have a functioning diplomatic presence on the ground. So the safety, the security, the continuing operation of that airport – it is of high importance to us. We are grateful that our Turkish partners have indicated a willingness to play a role in protecting that. Of course, Afghan Security Forces have an important role to play, too. But nothing that we have seen diminishes the importance we place on a functioning, safe, secure Hamid Karzai International Airport.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Have you picked up any hesitancy from the Turks on this issue?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> This is an issue that we have discussed, including at the highest levels, with our Turkish allies. President Biden, of course, discussed it with his counterpart, with President Erdogan. The department has discussed it in multiple levels. It is now principally a discussion that the Department of Defense is leading. As we always do, we keep those discussions in confidence, but we do appreciate Turkey’s willingness to take on an important role.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Following up &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; thank you – following up on the U.S.-Taliban agreement. Isn’t – to be more specific and try to get an answer – isn’t the Taliban violating the commitment not to attack cities and towns that was in the annexes of that agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That gets back to what we have consistently said. Levels of violence are too high. They are unacceptably high. That is why we are focused on diminishing the level of violence. We are doing this diplomatically; the State Department certainly is. But of course, the Afghans have a role to play, an important role to play – perhaps a more important role than they have had to play over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>And the other point is that yes, the Taliban have made gains; yes, the Taliban has inflicted horrific violence on their country, killing their fellow countrymen and women in the process, seemingly indiscriminately. At the same time – we’ve made this point before, but – the Afghan Government, the Afghan National Security Forces, far outnumber the Taliban – 300,000 – a capable fighting force of 300,000 troops, an air force that has modern weaponry, that has been trained by the United States, that just recently was provided with additional equipment. They have special forces. They have heavy equipment. So they have a capable fighting force.</p>
<p>For our part, we continue to support Afghan Security Forces. We’re committed to supporting those forces well into the future. You just look at what President Biden has requested in his budget request – $3.3 billion for the support of the Afghan Security Forces. That is a clear indication of our continuing support well into the future for these Afghan National Security Forces.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Was the withdrawal of the U.S. forces a condition-based withdrawal, and if yes, would you say that the Taliban are respecting their conditions of the withdrawal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Was our withdrawal conditions-based?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> No. Our withdrawal is not conditions-based, for the simple reason that it was preordained that a conditions-based withdrawal was essentially taken off the table. This administration could not – this President &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So why make a deal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So why make a deal if there was no conditions to the withdrawal?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The deal closed the door on a conditions-based withdrawal. It’s a very important point. The U.S.-Taliban agreement stipulates a number of things. Among those things that it stipulates is that on May 1st of this year the United States was to withdraw its military forces. This was an agreement that was concluded in early 2020, a year before this administration came in. It was an agreement that – as President Biden said when he announced the military withdrawal, it’s a deal that this administration probably would not have made, certainly not in all the detail. But it’s a deal that we inherited.</p>
<p>And so that gets back to the point that it was never an option for the United States to maintain its forces. Or I should say it was never a viable option for this President, a president who prioritizes the safety, the security, the well-being of our service members, to maintain forces there in significant numbers after May 1, knowing that the status quo would not stand after May 1. From April 30th to May 1st, our service members would have become – could have become, once again – targets of violence. And that is something that had not happened since the U.S.-Taliban agreement. That was not a proposition this President, this administration, was willing to accept.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one last on Afghanistan for me. You’ve been issuing the same warnings to the Taliban for the last several days and weeks. They haven’t heard any of it. What makes you think that they will change their course now that they’re gaining and gaining cities and capitals?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Look, we have been very clear where we stand, but also where the international community stands. You’re seeing this reflected right now in Qatar, where the Qataris are hosting a series of meetings involving much of the region, much of the international community, to discuss and to ultimately advance this diplomatic project.</p>
<p>I think there’s also a misconception that in order for negotiations, peace negotiations, to take place there is the requirement that there be peace on the ground. In fact, if you look back through history, very rarely have peace negotiations taken place when peace is present on the ground. What we’re seeing is levels of violence that are of grave concern. They’re certainly not within the spirt of the U.S.-Taliban agreement. But we know that diplomacy is the only way that we are ever going to achieve a durable solution and, insofar as we are concerned, a just solution.</p>
<p>And so we have made very clear that in order for us and for our allies and partners to be able to recognize any future government of Afghanistan and to provide assistance to it, it must emerge from a political settlement that meets five criteria. First, it must be inclusive; second, it must respect the rights of all Afghans, including women and minorities; third, it allows the Afghan people to have a say in choosing their leaders; fourth, it must prevent Afghan soil from being used to threaten the United States and its allies and partners; and fifth and finally, it must respect its commitments in terms of international law and international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>We’ve made these criteria very clear to the Taliban. President Ghani, Chairman Abdullah have accepted these criteria for their part. We have discussed these criteria with our allies and partners. And for us, this will be the roadmap for recognition and for assistance to any future government of Afghanistan. It’s not – again, not just us. It is the countries in the region and well beyond that espouse this.</p>
<p>Nick.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Ned, just a quick follow-up. So is there any circumstance under which the administration would consider stopping or reversing the troop withdrawal? Is there anything that the Taliban could do that would force this administration to do that, or are troops coming out no matter what?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, this gets back to I think what we were talking about before, but let me just say: Every commander in chief faces difficult choices. That’s really the nature of the role of commander in chief. If something reaches the desk of the president of the United States, any number of hundreds or thousands of people have probably mulled it over before with some degree of lack of consensus or consternation. President Biden made a very tough decision. He was clear that after 20 years of conflict, after our service members had accomplished the task that had been asked of them initially – the decimation of the network responsible for the 9/11 attacks, bringing Osama bin Laden to justice over 10 years ago – it was time for our troops to come home.</p>
<p>But the other relevant piece of this is that it gets back to what was in some ways preordained. The status quo was not an option. If we had announced a plan to extend our military presence or sustain it indefinitely, there was a risk, a not insignificant risk, that our service members would once again become the attempted targets of Taliban attacks and Taliban offensives.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>But so in – I mean, in other words, what you seem to be saying is that it&#8217;s okay if the Taliban don&#8217;t abide by their part of the deal because you&#8217;re acknowledging that there&#8217;s – the levels of violence are too high, but then at the same time, you&#8217;re saying listen, we had to abide by our promises under this deal, even if the Taliban did not abide by their promises.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>No, what we&#8217;re saying is that President Biden decided very firmly that our military service members would not be bargaining chips, that their lives would not be used as leverage for what we would all hope and seek to achieve in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So are you then – I mean, okay – I mean, the U.S. maintains troop presences in countries all over the world indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I would caution against comparing what U.S. forces Korea face and what our service members in Afghanistan would have endured after May.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Okay. So the – the final question for me, then, is – I mean, are – is there an assessment now in the administration that essentially the process of the peace negotiation with the U.S. was essentially a gambit by the Taliban to get U.S. troops out, and once U.S. troops out – were out, they recognize that you would have no leverage to stop their advance, which seems to be exactly what happening? I mean, do you still believe that they negotiated with you guys in good faith?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, of course, this agreement was concluded in 2020, so – with the U.S. Government, of course, and that&#8217;s why – one of the reasons why it was important to honor it. But look, the idea that we don&#8217;t have leverage or that the Islamic Republic, the Government of Afghanistan doesn&#8217;t have leverage – that&#8217;s just not the case. The United States continues to have leverage, our – the international community, working closely with us, continues to have leverage, and the Afghan Government has tremendous leverage. Part of that is the numerical advantage that I spoke to before: 300,000 troops, an air force, special forces, heavy equipment, training, a commitment of partnership, continued support from the United States, $3.3 billion in the budget for continuing support to the ANDSF.</p>
<p>So the idea that the Taliban advance – continued Taliban advance is unstoppable, that there&#8217;s nothing that can stand in the way, that we&#8217;ll just have to watch it unfold, that is not the reality on the ground.</p>
<p>Conor.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Can I just follow up on that, and two other questions? You can&#8217;t compare the situation maybe to South Korea, but we have U.S. troops in Iraq who are under near-constant rocket fire as well. And they&#8217;re there to keep the situation stable against ISIS, a terror group. So how is that any different from what&#8217;s happening in Afghanistan, and why pull U.S. troops out from one country but leave them in another?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>It&#8217;s very difficult and dare I say impossible to compare one country to the next. You&#8217;re right that U.S. service members are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi Government in order – for one mission and one mission only, and that is in partnership for the counter-ISIS mission. We have similarly, when it comes to Afghanistan, been very clear – and this is one of our criteria that we have made clear to the Taliban; the President has made this clear to the American people and the international public – that we are determined that Afghanistan will never again become a staging ground for attacks against the United States. We believe and we are confident that we can do that through resources and capabilities that are so-called over the horizon, that aren&#8217;t stationed in Afghanistan but that we can call upon at a moment&#8217;s notice to disrupt a threat as it emerges.</p>
<p>The fact is that the security risks, that the danger that our service members would have been exposed to after May 1, when the Taliban would have deemed us to have been in violation of that agreement and our service members would once again – could well have once again become targets of attack, that is not a proposition this President was willing to accept. It wasn&#8217;t a proposition because this President prioritizes the security, the safety, the well-being of our service members, but this &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But why is that a proposition you’re willing to accept in Iraq, then, where they are under constant threat from rocket attacks as well?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The dynamic is entirely different. There is not an analogous situation on the ground. There is not an analogous agreement that was reached between – and even the idea of it sounds laughable – between the United States Government and ISIS. There is no analogous U.S.-ISIS agreement.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Inaudible.) It was – it was pretty laughable not so many years ago that there would ever be a deal between the U.S. and the Taliban.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just a second question, then.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You talk consistently about the Taliban paying a cost in the future, that they would be an international pariah, there would be no international assistance. Why haven’t you imposed the costs on the Taliban now for what’s happening? Why haven’t you imposed some sort of costs on their leadership for the atrocities that you say that their group is committing, for the ongoing offensive?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Yeah. It’s a good question. All tools – we have not taken any tool off the table except for this military presence on the ground. The Afghan Government continues to have a capable and highly numerically superior fighting force. They are imposing costs. They have the potential to impose even greater costs on the Taliban. Of course, there are other tools at our disposal that fall short of reintroducing U.S. forces. We have not ruled any of those out, and so if it’s appropriate for us to use them, we won’t hesitate to do so.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just one last question: It’s three weeks now until the military withdrawal is supposed to be complete. The administration has committed to relocating 4,000 Afghan SIVs and their families, and that process hasn’t started. Do you realistically think – for the 4,000 who are going to third countries, do you realistically think that that is possible to complete within the next three weeks?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What the President said is that relocation flights would begin by the end of last month, and they did for this first group of SIV applicants. And let me just give you an update on that, because I know there’s great interest in this. So far, as of today, six flights have landed in the United States. We have relocated almost a thousand special immigrants and their family members as of August 10th. That number is, in fact, 995, so when we say almost, we mean almost. We are, of course, unable to preview upcoming flight schedules, but we expect to surpass that 1,000 number very shortly.</p>
<p>To date, approximately 60 percent of the Afghan special immigrants who arrived at Fort Lee have departed Fort Lee to begin their new lives in the United States with assistance from the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.</p>
<p>Let me mention one other point, because this will be important as to processing going forward: The State Department can now accept results of the so-called fit-to-fly medical exam that Afghan special immigrants participating in Operation Allies Refuge relocation flights must undergo for purposes of visa issuance. And so this accommodation has made it possible for more applicants to enter the United States with a visa in hand, conferring upon them lawful permanent residence status upon admission to the United States as a first-time arriving immigrant, and therefore negating the need for them to undergo additional processing at Fort Lee.</p>
<p>So, in other words, they are undergoing elements of this fit-to-fly medical exam in Afghanistan, in Kabul before they board, and so that will expedite their processing upon arrival in the United States. Many, if not most, of these special immigrants can now go directly to the relocation agencies to begin their new lives here in the United States.</p>
<p>Kylie.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just to follow up on that, so it’s 995 SIVs and their family members?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How many SIVs – like single applicants. Do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have that number, but 995 is the aggregate.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That includes the principal applicants and dependents.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And do you have any updates on flights to third countries or U.S. locations overseas?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, this is something – so as – so just to distinguish what we’re talking about, these so far 995 of the total 1,000 principal applicants, or approximately 4,000 within the group that had completed the security vetting, they are coming directly to the United States. There is a second larger group that has not completed – completed the chief of mission stage but not the security vetting. And so, as the President announced, they will be going to third countries. We have engaged a number of third countries; we’re continuing to have discussions with a number of our partners. Don’t have any details to share at this time, but as soon as we do, we will.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And then I just have one question: So we reported today that there is some active discussions underway about a further drawdown from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, and I understand it’s not going to be a major drawdown, but potentially a small drawdown is under consideration. And one thing that the department said is that the embassy in Kabul continues to pursue its full agenda of issues. And I’m just wondering, given everything that is unfolding on the ground there with the Taliban violence and gains, how the diplomacy and how the work that the embassy actually does on the ground has been impacted.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, it’s a very good question. Let me first talk about the staffing and security piece of it. As you know, in April, Embassy Kabul went on ordered departure status. That was in late April – April 27th, I believe it was. So our posture has not changed since then. What we have been doing, as we do for every diplomatic post in a challenging security environment, is to evaluate threats daily and to determine what the staffing posture that is in the best interests for those serving at the embassy and how we might be able to continue to keep them safe.</p>
<p>And so, of course, we do want to minimize the number of employees in Afghanistan whose functions can be performed elsewhere. And we spoke about this in the context of the SIV process. Instead of completing the chief of mission stage, having that processing done from Kabul, we’ve been able to do that from Washington, for example, or the Washington, D.C. area.</p>
<p>So that’s what we’re looking at, our – the point in all of this is that we intend for our partnership with the Afghan people to be enduring. In order for that to be the case, it’s important to have a diplomatic relationship and a diplomatic presence on the ground to do those functions that can’t be performed elsewhere. And there are a number of functions: the political element, the consular element that is important for that face-to-face diplomacy to take place under the auspices of our embassy.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So everything that you would like to do on the ground you’re able to do on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Obviously, it is a challenging security environment, and were we able, were we confident, were we comfortable having a larger staffing presence there, we would. But we are evaluating the threat environment on a daily basis. The embassy is in regular contact with Washington, with the most senior people in this building, who in turn are in regular contact with our colleagues at the NSC and the White House on this dynamic. But for right now, we have been able to continue those core activities that are important for us to conduct on the ground.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Sorry, if we can have a gradual break from Afghanistan &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-SOUTHKOREA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> &#8212; I have a question for – so I have two questions. First one is State Department’s willingness to promote freedom of the press outside the United States. So South Korea’s Moon government and the ruling party is pushing a new law that obliges media outlets to pay punitive damages for spreading fake news. And as you have seen in the United States, labeling critical news stories as fake news is a typical way of attempting to stifle criticism. So South Korean journalist associations expresses deep concern.</p>
<p>And so my question is: I understand Biden administration wants to show unity between the allies, but as the administration promotes freedom of the press and liberal democracy in the world, will the administration acquiesce this undermining of democratic values just to avoid presenting split between the allies? And if not, can you share State Department’s plan to address this issue with South Korean counterparts?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I don’t have a specific reaction to offer on this particular development, but I will say, broadly, freedom of the press, freedom of expression is a value that the United States supports the world over. And we’ve demonstrated that in the context of the Republic of Korea. When Secretary Blinken was in Seoul and he, of course, visited Tokyo and Seoul on his first physical travel overseas, we met with – he met with a number of emerging South Korean journalists – that is to say, young journalists working for some of the country’s biggest outlets – to affirm this – these enduring values and enduring principles that we share with our like-minded allies and partners. And so freedom of expression is something that we continue to stand for and will stand for in that context and every context.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So you want to avoid the specific – this mentioning about this development, but do you think there will be a private diplomatic discussion about this issue?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I wouldn’t want to wade into what may or may not be conveyed privately.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-CHINA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So my second question is Chinese nuclear buildup. So last Friday, Secretary Blinken expressed the concern that China has deviated from its past strategy of minimum deterrence. Is it now the U.S. Government’s official assessment that China has discarded no-first-use policy and shifted to launch on warning?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I’m not going to weigh in on the PRC’s nuclear doctrine. I will leave that to them. What is – what we have said and I think what is becoming more and more obvious is that the PRC is building a larger and more diverse nuclear arsenal. Despite efforts to obfuscate this, this rapid buildup has become more difficult to hide, and it does suggest that China is deviating from decades of nuclear strategy based around minimum deterrence.</p>
<p>These advances at the same time highlight why we believe it is important that it’s in everyone’s interests that nuclear powers talk to one another, that we engage in nonproliferation dialogue directly to discuss reducing nuclear dangers and avoiding miscalculation. We encourage Beijing to engage with us on practical measures to reduce the risks of destabilizing arms races and conflict.</p>
<p>Of course, our Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman recently engaged in a round of Strategic Stability Dialogue with the Russian Federation. And it’s important that nuclear powers – China, of course, be among them – be open to professional dialogue and discussion, precisely to reduce the risk of these weapons.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-JAPAN"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Two new question about China. First one: Yesterday, the Secretary Blinken met Japanese new national security advisor Akiba and they reaffirmed the importance of the peace and the stability in the Taiwan Strait. So what kind of specific contributions or the actions do you expect Japan to take to keeping this stability?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, stability across the strait is an important principle that not only we seek to uphold, but that we’ve discussed with our partners in the region, including Japan. For our part – and I wouldn’t want to speak to Tokyo’s approach to this; that’s for them to offer – we will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait relations, consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people on Taiwan. We have urged Beijing – and you’ve heard similar statements from our allies and partners in the Indo Pacific – to cease its military, its diplomatic, its economic pressure against Taiwan and to engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-OLYMPICS"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> One more question is about Olympics. Now that the Tokyo Olympics are over – although we still have the Paralympics – but let me ask about the current stance of the United States on participating in the next Beijing Winter Olympic Games?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, you’re right that the Tokyo Olympic Games have now concluded. Of course, the Paralympic Games are ahead of us. But it is still mid-2021 – August is still mid, I suppose – so we are not – don’t want to wade in just yet on 2022 Olympics. We are, as we have said, consulting closely with our allies and partners to, in the first instance, define those common concerns and to establish a shared approach. But again, I don’t want to get ahead of where we are, given that we still have some time to go.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> North Korea?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Six months.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Six months away. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> (Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah. And also mid-2021? Eight out of twelve is not exactly mid. You know, you’re on the &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Math was never my forte. But you get the point.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-NORTHKOREA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> On North Korea, do you have any response to the comment from Kim Jong-un’s sister about the U.S.-South Korea military exercise, calling Seoul “perfidious” yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have a specific response to the North Korean comments, but allow me to offer just a bit of context and – surrounding the policy from our side. First, let me reiterate that the joint military exercises are purely defensive in nature. We have made that point repeatedly, and it’s a very important one.</p>
<p>Second, as we have long maintained, the United States harbors no hostile intent towards the DPRK. We remain committed to the security of the Republic of Korea and our combined defense posture in accordance with our ironclad U.S.-ROK alliance. DOD may be able to provide additional details on these exercises, but the important point for us is that they are purely defensive in nature.</p>
<p>More broadly, and as we’ve said in recent weeks, we support inter-Korean dialogue. We support inter-Korean engagement, and we’ll continue to work with our ROK partners towards that end.</p>
<p>Yes. Let’s see, anyone who hasn’t – John, yeah.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-ETHIOPIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yeah, on Ethiopia. The prime minister is now calling for a national war effort and mass enlistment in response to battlefield losses to Tigray rebels. Does the administration have any response, coming just a week after Samantha Power was in the country calling for a ceasefire?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, that continues to be our message. You heard it very forcefully. Ethiopian officials heard it very frankly from Ambassador Power. We have continued to call for dialogue and a cessation of hostilities. That is precisely what Ambassador Power said during her visit last week. During her visit last week, she also made the point during her press conference that enflamed rhetoric makes it more difficult for all parties to come to the table and negotiate an end to this conflict. The focus, as we see it, should be and must be on dialogue that is needed for an inclusive peace and importantly to end the suffering of the civilian people of Ethiopia.</p>

<p><a id="post-269346-LITHUANIA"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I’m just wondering, on this China and Lithuania situation, do you guys have anything to say about China now demanding that Lithuania withdraw its ambassador from Beijing, after they opened this office, the Taiwan embassy?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we do stand in solidarity with our NATO Ally Lithuania and we condemn the PRC’s recent retaliatory actions, including the recall of Beijing’s ambassador from Vilnius and demanding Lithuania recall its ambassador from Beijing. We support our European partners and our allies as they develop mutually beneficial relations with Taiwan and resist the PRC’s coercive behavior. Taiwan is a global leader in public health and advanced manufacturing and democratic governance, to name just a few areas in which the international community – including the United States – benefits from engagement with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Each country should be able to determine the contours of its own “one China” policy without outside coercion. We have done just that. Of course, we have spoken to how this administration is engaging with the people on Taiwan in accord with our “one China” policy. But for further details on this, I would refer you to the Government of Lithuania.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And I just – I assume therefore that you support, if other countries are considering opening Taiwan embassies in their country, if they want to do that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We support engagement.</p>
<p>I’ll – we’ll do Tracy, and then Daphne.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-CHINAISRAEL"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, thank you. Since we’re back on China, do you have any comment on or knowledge of, or better yet, confirmation of China’s supposed cyber-attack on Israel?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I don’t have anything for you on that. Of course, we have seen and we have taken action against China’s – the PRC’s malign activity in cyberspace. We have taken actions to attribute even just recently when it comes to the attack against the Microsoft Exchange Server, and the details of that attribution we made public. But when – and of course, DOJ has previously charged PRC officials for activities, malign activities in the cyber realm, but I don’t have a specific response on that for you.</p>
<p>Daphne.</p>
<p><a id="post-269346-BURMA2"></a><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>A collection of more than 90 organizations have written to Secretary Blinken urging him to recognize the atrocities committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar as crimes against humanity and genocide.  You’ve been in office for nearly eight months now; why is the review of this determination taking so long?  And then is this a policy question rather than just looking at the facts?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So you heard – and I believe you asked Secretary Blinken for an update when he was here just a couple weeks ago. He said at the time that that evaluation of the facts and the law is ongoing. Of course, it’s important that we have a full understanding of the facts, of the law, and also the implications when it comes to any sort of designation.</p>
<p>What remains true, and what we’ve said before, is that many of the individuals who are now in leadership positions within the junta are and were responsible for the – for some of the alleged atrocities against the Rohingya. We continue to believe that they should be held to account for that, for their anti-democratic practices more recently, and we will continue to find ways to do just that. But I don’t have an update to offer on any – on that particular determination.</p>
<p>Conor.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Follow-up, related on Myanmar. Last week, Wendy Sherman had a phone call with Zin Mar, who is the sort of acting foreign minister of the National Unity Government. Should this be taken as a sign that the Biden administration is considering recognizing the NUG as the legitimate government in Myanmar?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what we’ve said is that we engage with – first of all, we are standing with the people of Burma, who very clearly still aspire to see their democracy restored. As part of our strong support for the people of Burma, we are engaging with the full range of civil society and pro-democracy groups that seek to do that, that seek to restore democratic governance.</p>
<p>To date, it has not only been Deputy Secretary Sherman but EAP bureau leadership and our U.S. ambassador to Burma. They’ve met with NUG leaders. We continue to deepen such engagement. When Deputy Secretary Sherman spoke to Zin Mar Aung last week, they discussed ongoing efforts to return Burma to a path to democracy, including continued U.S. support for the pro-democracy movement. They also discussed the toll of COVID-19 in Burma and efforts to provide critical humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma.</p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 3:06 p.m.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>College Park, MD</p>
<p>University of Maryland A. James Clark School of Engineering </p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.</p>
<p>It is wonderful to be here at the University of Maryland, College Park, one of our country’s outstanding public research universities, to be joined by some of the students, university leaders, and public servants who help make this community such a dynamic place to learn, to teach, and to create.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I especially want to thank you, both for your kind words, for hosting us today, and for your leadership of this institution.  Leader Hoyer, it’s always an honor and a pleasure to be with you.  I know you’re a very proud alum of this university.  Thank you so much for taking the time to join us, as well as to my colleagues and friends, Senator Cardin, Senator Van Hollen.  Now, I’m flattered to think that I had something to do with you being out here this afternoon, but I know that’s not the case.  It’s this university, the University of Maryland.  I know your strong support across the board for this extraordinary institution and I’m glad to be able to share in that with you today.</p>
<p>And Sarah, a special thanks to you for a wonderful introduction.  Look, in the unlikely event that engineering somehow doesn’t work out, diplomacy, think about it.  We may want to bring you in.  Thank you so much.</p>
<p>The best part of today for me is getting to spend time with some of the extraordinary young people here at College Park.</p>
<p>As Secretary, I’m often focused on events that are taking place thousands of miles away.  The last lab that I actually toured was at the University of Copenhagen, so across an ocean.  But I wanted to come here today to the University of Maryland – 10 miles from the State Department – because, as has been noted, the innovation happening here and at thousands of colleges and universities across America is a huge source of our strength.</p>
<p>And whether America protects and invests in our strength at home is going to determine whether we remain strong in the world and deliver results for the American people.</p>
<p>I’ve got to tell you that maybe more than at any other time in my career – maybe in my lifetime – old distinctions between domestic and foreign policy have simply fallen away.  Our domestic renewal and our strength in the world are completely entwined.</p>
<p>And that’s why I’m here today, because there’s nothing we can do that will enhance our global standing and influence more than what our domestic renewal can deliver, particularly when it comes to the strength of our workforce, our economic dynamism, the quality of opportunity we offer our people, the resilience of our infrastructure, and the power of our innovation.</p>
<p>And I’m here to tell you that we could be doing better.  That is the hard truth.</p>
<p>We’re falling behind where we once were in the world.  And our rivals, slowly but surely, are pulling close behind us.  In some areas, they’re already ahead of us.</p>
<p>And this matters.</p>
<p>It matters because if these trends continue, we’ll be less competitive in a more competitive world.</p>
<p>The weight of our diplomacy and our ability to advance the interests and values of the American people will suffer.</p>
<p>And the democratic model and way of life will be less able to withstand a fierce challenge from authoritarian governments.</p>
<p>Most of all, investing in our domestic renewal now will make our future more secure, more prosperous, more free.</p>
<p>So what I’d like to do today is talk about the foreign policy, the national security case for public investment at home, because it’s vital that we act.</p>
<p>And let’s start by stepping back for just a minute.</p>
<p>I think you all know this very, very well:  For a long time, America made big investments in ourselves.</p>
<p>We established universal elementary school.  We made investments in public secondary education.  Between 1910 and 1940, the percentage of American teens in high school went from 18 percent to 70 percent.  President Lincoln signed into law land-grant colleges, like the University of Maryland, so that more people could get higher education.  President Roosevelt signed the GI Bill so more service members and veterans could go to college and get job training, and more than 50 percent of its beneficiaries went on to start a business.</p>
<p>These and other programs weren’t perfect.  We know that.  They weren’t equitable.  Many people were left out because of their race or gender.  We’re still working to close those gaps today.  But these investments helped America’s economy leap ahead and made the United States workforce the wealthiest and best educated in the entire world.</p>
<p>Through the decades, we also invested in roads, in railways, in highways, in ports, airports, power grids, water systems – a vast public infrastructure that was the foundation for us becoming the strongest economy in the world, with a workforce and standard of living that set us apart.</p>
<p>But in recent decades, our public investment as a share of the economy has fallen more than 40 percent.  We’re still relying heavily on those earlier achievements – schools, roads, and innovations created a long time ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other countries have doubled down.  For example, China is spending three times as much on infrastructure as we do every year.  And it’s not just China.  The United States now ranks 13th in the world in the total quality of our infrastructure, and if we don’t make major investments soon, it’ll be more than just 12 countries ahead of us.</p>
<p>We’re falling behind on innovation.  Thirty years ago, we ranked number one in the world in terms of how much we invested as a share of our economy in research and development.  It’s how we won the space race, mapped the human genome, built the internet.  Now we’re number nine.  China used to be number eight.  Now they’re number two.</p>
<p>Here at the Clark School, students are learning advanced manufacturing technologies, like this hyperloop pod for mag-lev high-speed train travel, created by the award-winning UMD Loop team, made up entirely of undergraduates.  I just got a tour of the Advanced Fabrication Lab and saw some of what you’re creating here with 3D printing.  We as a country should be doing much more to support this kind of work.  The bipartisan U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, for example, which the Senate has approved, would boost federal funding for U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing and provide $52 billion over five years for research initiatives.  Because research in fields like robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotech, and solar cells is racing ahead – and too often, we are not the ones out in front.  We’re missing out on the chance to build and lead the industries of the future.</p>
<p>Now, there’s no question that the free market can do a lot to spur investment.  The creativity, ingenuity, and dynamism of the American private sector is unmatched in the world.  It’s our greatest competitive advantage.  But there are some things that even the most vibrant private sector can’t do on its own.  Public investment is still vital.</p>
<p>Moreover, America’s entrepreneurs are able to do their pathbreaking work in part because of the foundation provided by public investment.  The work of the most brilliant scientists is rooted in publicly funded basic research.  Companies run on public utilities.  Public schools helped educate their workforce.</p>
<p>So public and private investment are both essential.  It’s not either/or.  It’s both/and.</p>
<p>Now, make no mistake – we are still the most powerful country and economy in the world.  We’re resilient and entrepreneurial; there’s a reason the world’s most successful companies are born here.  Our network of alliances and partnership with other countries is unmatched; our military is the most powerful fighting force on the planet.  And the American workforce is outstanding, and that includes all the people from other countries who move to the United States every year to work hard and build better lives for themselves, because this is still the place where the world’s strivers and dreamers want to be.</p>
<p>As President Biden says, it’s never a good bet to bet against America – never has been, never will be.</p>
<p>But we became the United States of America because past generations of Americans reinvented, renewed, and reinvested in our core sources of strength.  They used American ingenuity and determination to do it – and they didn’t just to prepare for the future, they created it.  They shaped it.</p>
<p>Now it’s our job to take up the baton and carry it forward for future generations.</p>
<p>I believe our domestic renewal is the most important thing we can do to advance our foreign policy for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, this is about our global competitiveness.</p>
<p>We’re competing for jobs.  We want the high-skilled, high-paying careers of the future to be created here, not somewhere else.</p>
<p>We’re competing for investment.  We want the investors, the companies, the countries to look at the United States and say, “That’s where we want to be.”  And they’re much more likely to say that when they know that everything about operating in America is top of the line, from the reliability of our broadband to the efficiency of our ports to how well-trained our workers are.</p>
<p>We’re competing for trade.  For too long, we thought we could trade more with the world while investing less here at home.  That didn’t work out for our economy, for our workers, or for our communities.  President Biden has made it clear that before making more trade deals, we must first make a generational investment in our own competitiveness.  Our domestic renewal comes first.  If we do that, we will compete in the 21st-century global economy from a position of strength.  We will keep faith with American workers; shape the terms of global trade; ensure that labor, environmental, and intellectual property standards are protected; and stand with our allies and partners when others seek to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>We’re also competing for the best and the brightest.  One of the most powerful, I say even magical things about the United States is that we have long been a destination for talented, driven people from everywhere on Earth.  No other country has that kind of pull on people’s imaginations and ambitions.  And that also goes for our universities.  There are thousands of top international students here at College Park getting a world-class education; we’re lucky they chose us.  We want always to be the place that represents opportunity, possibility, achievement.  Investing in our domestic renewal now means that we can continue to be that beacon to the world.</p>
<p>Second, our domestic renewal is a foreign policy priority because it empowers our diplomacy.  Take it from me, when you’re sitting at the table with foreign leaders, trying to persuade them to align with your point of view or join your coalition or stop doing something that you disagree with, it makes all the difference in the world to be operating from a position of national strength.  And that goes far beyond military might.  If your economy is growing, if your people are healthy, if the cultural life of your country is thriving, if your country is known to give people from all backgrounds access to opportunity, it all adds up to greater diplomatic strength.</p>
<p>Countries pay attention to these things.  And they pay attention if you aren’t strong in those ways, too.</p>
<p>This is particularly important now, because it’s no secret to any of us that the Chinese and Russian governments, among others, are making the argument in public and in private that the United States is in decline – so it’s better to cast your lot with their authoritarian visions for the world than with our democratic one.</p>
<p>We can and we do remind them that we continue to be an abundantly strong country by measure after measure.  When we met with Chinese officials in Anchorage in March, our first topic of discussion was what we’re achieving here at home – a robust economic recovery, a massive national program to fight COVID.  We wanted them to know that we will emerge from the pandemic stronger than before and better able to rally our friends and partners in the world to stand up against aggression, abuse, and coercion.</p>
<p>Nothing would put to rest faster their specious argument about America’s best days being behind us than if the United States made serious investments in our domestic renewal right now.  It’s a lot harder to say a country is in decline when you’re watching it become stronger, more effective, more united before your very eyes.</p>
<p>I can tell you, too, that from my own experience so far as Secretary of State, when I tell countries that America is back, they believe it because they’re seeing how much effort we’re putting into building our alliances and partnerships, and showing up again in the rooms where decisions are made and democratic principles are defended.  But they will believe it even more when we make major investments in our own renewal here at home.  And that will make my job of advancing our interests and values around the world easier because there’ll be no question that America is back.</p>
<p>I can also tell you that our friends around the world are also hoping that we’ll make these investments.  They want badly for us to succeed because they know that when we’re strong, they benefit too.</p>
<p>Third, our domestic renewal is about standing up for democracy<strong>, </strong>and that is a foreign policy imperative.</p>
<p>Democracy is under threat around the world right now.  Authoritarianism and nationalism are on the rise.  And the United States is out there every day fighting the good fight for political freedom and human rights.  We’re making the argument that our system – the democratic system – is the better one.  But it’s one thing to say it; it’s another to show it.  By investing in our strength at home, we can show the world that democracies can do hard things and that we can do them without jailing dissidents, letting corruption run rampant, or violating fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p>The more we and all democracies can show the world that we can deliver – for our people, for each other – the more we can refute the lie that authoritarian countries love to tell – that our system is hopelessly polarized and paralyzed and that theirs is the better way to meet people’s fundamental needs and hopes.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve said the word “China” a few times today, and it’s true that when we talk about competitors, we often talk about China.  They’re a rising power.  And they’re full speed ahead when it comes to investing in infrastructure, growth, innovation.</p>
<p>But I’m not only talking about China here today.  Many countries are making major investments in their own domestic renewal right now.  For the United States to continue to lead and to successfully bring countries together in common cause for the good of all our people, we have to do the same.</p>
<p>Plus, ultimately, this isn’t really about anyone else.  This is about us and what we can do to make our lives and our future even brighter.</p>
<p>When President Biden gave me the honor of taking on the role of America’s chief diplomat, he made it crystal clear that I had one job above all others: to help deliver for the American people, to make your lives more secure, create opportunity for you and your families, and tackle the global crises that are increasingly shaping your lives.  My ability to do that – and the ability for everyone who holds this job after me to do that – will depend on the choices we make as a country now and in the months and years to come.</p>
<p>At our best, the American people share a spirit of boundless optimism and possibility.  People around the world are inspired by it; I hear that everywhere I go.  We need to bring that spirit to bear in this endeavor to renew our sources of domestic strength and invest in our future greatness.  That’s how we’ll lead the world in the industries of tomorrow and that’s how we’ll carry forward the eternal work of making the United States a more perfect union.</p>

<p>College Park, MD</p>
<p>University of Maryland A. James Clark School of Engineering </p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.</p>
<p>It is wonderful to be here at the University of Maryland, College Park, one of our country’s outstanding public research universities, to be joined by some of the students, university leaders, and public servants who help make this community such a dynamic place to learn, to teach, and to create.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I especially want to thank you, both for your kind words, for hosting us today, and for your leadership of this institution.  Leader Hoyer, it’s always an honor and a pleasure to be with you.  I know you’re a very proud alum of this university.  Thank you so much for taking the time to join us, as well as to my colleagues and friends, Senator Cardin, Senator Van Hollen.  Now, I’m flattered to think that I had something to do with you being out here this afternoon, but I know that’s not the case.  It’s this university, the University of Maryland.  I know your strong support across the board for this extraordinary institution and I’m glad to be able to share in that with you today.</p>
<p>And Sarah, a special thanks to you for a wonderful introduction.  Look, in the unlikely event that engineering somehow doesn’t work out, diplomacy, think about it.  We may want to bring you in.  Thank you so much.</p>
<p>The best part of today for me is getting to spend time with some of the extraordinary young people here at College Park.</p>
<p>As Secretary, I’m often focused on events that are taking place thousands of miles away.  The last lab that I actually toured was at the University of Copenhagen, so across an ocean.  But I wanted to come here today to the University of Maryland – 10 miles from the State Department – because, as has been noted, the innovation happening here and at thousands of colleges and universities across America is a huge source of our strength.</p>
<p>And whether America protects and invests in our strength at home is going to determine whether we remain strong in the world and deliver results for the American people.</p>
<p>I’ve got to tell you that maybe more than at any other time in my career – maybe in my lifetime – old distinctions between domestic and foreign policy have simply fallen away.  Our domestic renewal and our strength in the world are completely entwined.</p>
<p>And that’s why I’m here today, because there’s nothing we can do that will enhance our global standing and influence more than what our domestic renewal can deliver, particularly when it comes to the strength of our workforce, our economic dynamism, the quality of opportunity we offer our people, the resilience of our infrastructure, and the power of our innovation.</p>
<p>And I’m here to tell you that we could be doing better.  That is the hard truth.</p>
<p>We’re falling behind where we once were in the world.  And our rivals, slowly but surely, are pulling close behind us.  In some areas, they’re already ahead of us.</p>
<p>And this matters.</p>
<p>It matters because if these trends continue, we’ll be less competitive in a more competitive world.</p>
<p>The weight of our diplomacy and our ability to advance the interests and values of the American people will suffer.</p>
<p>And the democratic model and way of life will be less able to withstand a fierce challenge from authoritarian governments.</p>
<p>Most of all, investing in our domestic renewal now will make our future more secure, more prosperous, more free.</p>
<p>So what I’d like to do today is talk about the foreign policy, the national security case for public investment at home, because it’s vital that we act.</p>
<p>And let’s start by stepping back for just a minute.</p>
<p>I think you all know this very, very well:  For a long time, America made big investments in ourselves.</p>
<p>We established universal elementary school.  We made investments in public secondary education.  Between 1910 and 1940, the percentage of American teens in high school went from 18 percent to 70 percent.  President Lincoln signed into law land-grant colleges, like the University of Maryland, so that more people could get higher education.  President Roosevelt signed the GI Bill so more service members and veterans could go to college and get job training, and more than 50 percent of its beneficiaries went on to start a business.</p>
<p>These and other programs weren’t perfect.  We know that.  They weren’t equitable.  Many people were left out because of their race or gender.  We’re still working to close those gaps today.  But these investments helped America’s economy leap ahead and made the United States workforce the wealthiest and best educated in the entire world.</p>
<p>Through the decades, we also invested in roads, in railways, in highways, in ports, airports, power grids, water systems – a vast public infrastructure that was the foundation for us becoming the strongest economy in the world, with a workforce and standard of living that set us apart.</p>
<p>But in recent decades, our public investment as a share of the economy has fallen more than 40 percent.  We’re still relying heavily on those earlier achievements – schools, roads, and innovations created a long time ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other countries have doubled down.  For example, China is spending three times as much on infrastructure as we do every year.  And it’s not just China.  The United States now ranks 13th in the world in the total quality of our infrastructure, and if we don’t make major investments soon, it’ll be more than just 12 countries ahead of us.</p>
<p>We’re falling behind on innovation.  Thirty years ago, we ranked number one in the world in terms of how much we invested as a share of our economy in research and development.  It’s how we won the space race, mapped the human genome, built the internet.  Now we’re number nine.  China used to be number eight.  Now they’re number two.</p>
<p>Here at the Clark School, students are learning advanced manufacturing technologies, like this hyperloop pod for mag-lev high-speed train travel, created by the award-winning UMD Loop team, made up entirely of undergraduates.  I just got a tour of the Advanced Fabrication Lab and saw some of what you’re creating here with 3D printing.  We as a country should be doing much more to support this kind of work.  The bipartisan U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, for example, which the Senate has approved, would boost federal funding for U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing and provide $52 billion over five years for research initiatives.  Because research in fields like robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotech, and solar cells is racing ahead – and too often, we are not the ones out in front.  We’re missing out on the chance to build and lead the industries of the future.</p>
<p>Now, there’s no question that the free market can do a lot to spur investment.  The creativity, ingenuity, and dynamism of the American private sector is unmatched in the world.  It’s our greatest competitive advantage.  But there are some things that even the most vibrant private sector can’t do on its own.  Public investment is still vital.</p>
<p>Moreover, America’s entrepreneurs are able to do their pathbreaking work in part because of the foundation provided by public investment.  The work of the most brilliant scientists is rooted in publicly funded basic research.  Companies run on public utilities.  Public schools helped educate their workforce.</p>
<p>So public and private investment are both essential.  It’s not either/or.  It’s both/and.</p>
<p>Now, make no mistake – we are still the most powerful country and economy in the world.  We’re resilient and entrepreneurial; there’s a reason the world’s most successful companies are born here.  Our network of alliances and partnership with other countries is unmatched; our military is the most powerful fighting force on the planet.  And the American workforce is outstanding, and that includes all the people from other countries who move to the United States every year to work hard and build better lives for themselves, because this is still the place where the world’s strivers and dreamers want to be.</p>
<p>As President Biden says, it’s never a good bet to bet against America – never has been, never will be.</p>
<p>But we became the United States of America because past generations of Americans reinvented, renewed, and reinvested in our core sources of strength.  They used American ingenuity and determination to do it – and they didn’t just to prepare for the future, they created it.  They shaped it.</p>
<p>Now it’s our job to take up the baton and carry it forward for future generations.</p>
<p>I believe our domestic renewal is the most important thing we can do to advance our foreign policy for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, this is about our global competitiveness.</p>
<p>We’re competing for jobs.  We want the high-skilled, high-paying careers of the future to be created here, not somewhere else.</p>
<p>We’re competing for investment.  We want the investors, the companies, the countries to look at the United States and say, “That’s where we want to be.”  And they’re much more likely to say that when they know that everything about operating in America is top of the line, from the reliability of our broadband to the efficiency of our ports to how well-trained our workers are.</p>
<p>We’re competing for trade.  For too long, we thought we could trade more with the world while investing less here at home.  That didn’t work out for our economy, for our workers, or for our communities.  President Biden has made it clear that before making more trade deals, we must first make a generational investment in our own competitiveness.  Our domestic renewal comes first.  If we do that, we will compete in the 21st-century global economy from a position of strength.  We will keep faith with American workers; shape the terms of global trade; ensure that labor, environmental, and intellectual property standards are protected; and stand with our allies and partners when others seek to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>We’re also competing for the best and the brightest.  One of the most powerful, I say even magical things about the United States is that we have long been a destination for talented, driven people from everywhere on Earth.  No other country has that kind of pull on people’s imaginations and ambitions.  And that also goes for our universities.  There are thousands of top international students here at College Park getting a world-class education; we’re lucky they chose us.  We want always to be the place that represents opportunity, possibility, achievement.  Investing in our domestic renewal now means that we can continue to be that beacon to the world.</p>
<p>Second, our domestic renewal is a foreign policy priority because it empowers our diplomacy.  Take it from me, when you’re sitting at the table with foreign leaders, trying to persuade them to align with your point of view or join your coalition or stop doing something that you disagree with, it makes all the difference in the world to be operating from a position of national strength.  And that goes far beyond military might.  If your economy is growing, if your people are healthy, if the cultural life of your country is thriving, if your country is known to give people from all backgrounds access to opportunity, it all adds up to greater diplomatic strength.</p>
<p>Countries pay attention to these things.  And they pay attention if you aren’t strong in those ways, too.</p>
<p>This is particularly important now, because it’s no secret to any of us that the Chinese and Russian governments, among others, are making the argument in public and in private that the United States is in decline – so it’s better to cast your lot with their authoritarian visions for the world than with our democratic one.</p>
<p>We can and we do remind them that we continue to be an abundantly strong country by measure after measure.  When we met with Chinese officials in Anchorage in March, our first topic of discussion was what we’re achieving here at home – a robust economic recovery, a massive national program to fight COVID.  We wanted them to know that we will emerge from the pandemic stronger than before and better able to rally our friends and partners in the world to stand up against aggression, abuse, and coercion.</p>
<p>Nothing would put to rest faster their specious argument about America’s best days being behind us than if the United States made serious investments in our domestic renewal right now.  It’s a lot harder to say a country is in decline when you’re watching it become stronger, more effective, more united before your very eyes.</p>
<p>I can tell you, too, that from my own experience so far as Secretary of State, when I tell countries that America is back, they believe it because they’re seeing how much effort we’re putting into building our alliances and partnerships, and showing up again in the rooms where decisions are made and democratic principles are defended.  But they will believe it even more when we make major investments in our own renewal here at home.  And that will make my job of advancing our interests and values around the world easier because there’ll be no question that America is back.</p>
<p>I can also tell you that our friends around the world are also hoping that we’ll make these investments.  They want badly for us to succeed because they know that when we’re strong, they benefit too.</p>
<p>Third, our domestic renewal is about standing up for democracy<strong>, </strong>and that is a foreign policy imperative.</p>
<p>Democracy is under threat around the world right now.  Authoritarianism and nationalism are on the rise.  And the United States is out there every day fighting the good fight for political freedom and human rights.  We’re making the argument that our system – the democratic system – is the better one.  But it’s one thing to say it; it’s another to show it.  By investing in our strength at home, we can show the world that democracies can do hard things and that we can do them without jailing dissidents, letting corruption run rampant, or violating fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p>The more we and all democracies can show the world that we can deliver – for our people, for each other – the more we can refute the lie that authoritarian countries love to tell – that our system is hopelessly polarized and paralyzed and that theirs is the better way to meet people’s fundamental needs and hopes.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve said the word “China” a few times today, and it’s true that when we talk about competitors, we often talk about China.  They’re a rising power.  And they’re full speed ahead when it comes to investing in infrastructure, growth, innovation.</p>
<p>But I’m not only talking about China here today.  Many countries are making major investments in their own domestic renewal right now.  For the United States to continue to lead and to successfully bring countries together in common cause for the good of all our people, we have to do the same.</p>
<p>Plus, ultimately, this isn’t really about anyone else.  This is about us and what we can do to make our lives and our future even brighter.</p>
<p>When President Biden gave me the honor of taking on the role of America’s chief diplomat, he made it crystal clear that I had one job above all others: to help deliver for the American people, to make your lives more secure, create opportunity for you and your families, and tackle the global crises that are increasingly shaping your lives.  My ability to do that – and the ability for everyone who holds this job after me to do that – will depend on the choices we make as a country now and in the months and years to come.</p>
<p>At our best, the American people share a spirit of boundless optimism and possibility.  People around the world are inspired by it; I hear that everywhere I go.  We need to bring that spirit to bear in this endeavor to renew our sources of domestic strength and invest in our future greatness.  That’s how we’ll lead the world in the industries of tomorrow and that’s how we’ll carry forward the eternal work of making the United States a more perfect union.</p>
<p>Thank so much for listening.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Virtual Participation</p>
<p class="p1"><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, thank you very much, Foreign Minister Jaishankar.  It’s wonderful to be with you and please convey our thanks to Prime Minister Modi for bringing us together for this critically important discussion and for India’s leadership on these issues, especially in championing a free and open Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p class="p1">When I last had the chance to address the Council back in May, it was to underscore the importance of defending, upholding, and revitalizing the rules-based international order grounded in the United Nations Charter.  Few issues are more crucial to that endeavor than the future of our ocean.  The ocean not only covers 70 percent of Earth and accounts for 97 percent of its water, but it is crucial to the livelihood of our people and the sustainability of our planet.  Maritime safety and security are enduring interests of all nations and are vital natural (inaudible).</p>
<p class="p1">(Interruption.)</p>
<p class="p1">Thank you.  Freedom of navigation and overflight and the unimpeded flow of lawful maritime commerce are also critical to the security and prosperity of nations and to global stability.  The international community has long benefited from a rules-based maritime order where international law, as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, sets out the legal framework for all activities in the ocean and seas.</p>
<p class="p1">But despite having a clear body of international law that we’ve all committed to abide by and uphold, despite all the ways that freedom of the seas, open waterways, and the unimpeded flow of lawful maritime commerce have delivered for nations and people around the world, and despite the indispensable role this maritime order has played in fostering economic activity, security cooperation, scientific innovation, environmental sustainability – despite all of that, the order is under serious threat.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why I’m grateful for India’s leadership in bringing us together today and calling on all nations to recommit to defending and strengthening the maritime rules and principles that we forged together and committed to uphold.</p>
<p class="p1">Let me just speak, if I could, specifically to some of the critical areas where we see maritime rules and principles under threat.</p>
<p class="p1">In the South China Sea, we have seen dangerous encounters between vessels at sea and provocative actions to advance unlawful maritime claims.  The United States has made clear its concerns regarding actions that intimidate and bully other states from lawfully accessing their maritime resources.  And we and other countries, including South China Sea claimants, have protested such behavior and unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea.</p>
<p class="p1">Five years ago, an arbitral tribunal constituted under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention delivered a unanimous and legally binding decision to the parties before it firmly rejecting unlawful, expansive South China Sea maritime claims as being inconsistent with international law.  The United States has consistently called for all countries to conform their maritime claims to the International Law of the Sea as reflected in the 1982 convention.</p>
<p class="p1">This is in keeping with the peaceful resolution of disputes and the sovereign equality of member-states, which are core principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  Efforts to resolve maritime disputes through threat or use of force flout these principles.</p>
<p class="p1">Some may assert that resolving the dispute in the South China Sea is not the business of the United States or any other country that is not a claimant to the islands and waters.  But it is the business and, even more, the responsibility of every member-state to defend the rules that we’ve all agreed to follow and peacefully resolve maritime disputes.  Conflict in the South China Sea or in any ocean would have serious global consequences for security and for commerce.  What’s more, when a state faces no consequences for ignoring these rules, it fuels greater impunity and instability everywhere.</p>
<p class="p1">States are also provocatively and unlawfully advancing their interests in the Persian Gulf and the Black Sea.  On July 29th, the <i>Mercer Street</i>, a commercial ship that was peacefully transiting international waters in the North Arabian Sea, was attacked using explosive unmanned aerial vehicles, resulting in the death of two people.  Upon review of the available information, we are confident that Iran conducted this unjustified attack, which is part of a pattern of attacks and other provocative behavior.  These actions threaten freedom of navigation through this crucial waterway, international shipping and commerce, and the lives of people on the vessels involved.</p>
<p class="p1">On behalf of the United States, I reiterate my condolences to the families of the victims and to the United Kingdom and Romania.  It is on all of our nations to hold accountable those responsible.  Failing to do so will only fuel their sense of impunity and embolden others inclined to disregard the maritime order.</p>
<p class="p1">In the Black Sea, the Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov, we see continued aggressive actions against Ukraine with dangerous incursions on the sea and in the air and the harassment of vessels, which are disrupting commerce and energy access.  We reaffirm our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, extending to its territorial waters.  Crimea is Ukraine.</p>
<p class="p1">When nations ignore or purport to redraw the borders of other nations, whether by land or by sea, they undermine the sovereign equality of member-states, a guiding principle of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="p1">Non-state actors also pose serious risk to maritime safety and security, from pirates and illicit maritime traffickers in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, to pirates and armed robbers in the Gulf of Guinea, to drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea and the Eastern Pacific.  Yet our collective response to these actors shows how effective we can be when we work together to defend maritime order and hold those accountable who violate it.</p>
<p class="p1">We see that in the Africa-led Yaounde Architecture for Maritime Safety and Security, which was supported by Friends of the Gulf of Guinea, and in the Nigerian-led Deep Blue Project and Maritime Collaborative Forum.  We see it in India’s Maritime Fusion Center, which has enhanced cooperation among Indian Ocean partners, and in the widespread ratification by countries of the Caribbean Basin of the Treaty of San Jose.</p>
<p class="p1">We see it in the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, which has demonstrated significant success in building an effective regional response, most notably in law enforcement.  The United States led the creation of this group and we remain active in its work and in coordinating naval operations to prevent a resurgence of piracy in the area.  We’re grateful to fellow Security Council members for supporting annual resolutions to help coordinate and strengthen these efforts.</p>
<p class="p1">We must bring the same coordinated and comprehensive responses to other threats to maritime safety and security.  This includes illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which undermines the sustainability of fish stocks, circumvents agreed conservation and management measures, and violate the sovereign rights of coastal states, and often goes hand in hand with the use of forced labor and other illicit activities.  And it also includes responding to environmental disasters, like the cooperation between Sri Lanka, the United States, and other countries to mitigate the impact of the <i>MV X-Press Pearl</i> catastrophe.</p>
<p class="p1">All of these activities require that we share information and coordinate our responses, that we help build the capacity of our maritime partners, that we engage with affected communities, industry, nongovernmental organizations, which are critically important allies in this effort.</p>
<p class="p1">Together, our nations have spent decades building this maritime order and the broader rules-based international system that it is a part of.  We’ve done so out of a shared recognition that it benefits all our nations and all our people when governments accept certain constraints on their actions rather than living in a world where the strong do what they can and where those who are less powerful feel coerced and threatened.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s never been more true than it is today, and that makes the collective effort to defend, to strengthen, and build upon this order more urgent than ever.  Thanks very much.</p>

<p class="p1">On the one-year anniversary of Belarus’s fraudulent presidential election, the United States government has taken decisive action against forty-four individuals and entities in order to hold <span class="s1">Alyaksandr</span> Lukashenka and his regime to account for its continued, violent repression of Belarusians inside and outside the country.  These steps are a further consequence to the Belarusian authorities’ continued flagrant disregard for human rights and Belarus’s failure to comply with its obligations under international human rights law.</p>
<p class="p2">Pursuant to a new Executive Order the President signed today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated forty-four individuals and entities. These sanctions are the latest in a series of efforts demonstrating our determination to take action in the face of the increased repression and sharply deteriorating human rights situation in Belarus.  <span class="s2">OFAC targeted, among others, entities and individuals, including state-owned enterprises, government officials, and others, who support the regime, facilitate its violent repression of the Belarusian people, and violate the rule of law.  </span></p>
<p class="p1">Democratic countries are stronger when they stand together. Alongside these U.S. actions, we welcome the steps taken today by the United Kingdom and Canada against the regime and those announced by the European Union on June 24. The United States further commends the ongoing close coordination with Lithuania and Poland as a demonstration of the steadfast international resolve in supporting the Belarusian people’s democratic aspirations.</p>
<p class="p2">One year ago, the people of Belarus turned out in record numbers to give voice to their democratic aspirations and desire for change.  Instead of honoring their votes, the regime fraudulently declared victory and embarked on a campaign of violence and repression.  Since that time, Lukashenka has sought to cement his hold on power at the expense of the Belarusian people.  Over 600 political prisoners are unjustly detained.  Independent media outlets have been raided and shuttered, and Belarusian authorities are attempting to silence NGOs and vital members of civil society.  Moreover, this repression does not occur solely within Belarus’s borders, as Belarusians abroad also face intimidation.  This repression features blatant disregard of international norms, as displayed by the brazen forced diversion of Ryanair flight 4978 for the purpose of arresting a Belarusian journalist, the dangerous attempt to intimidate the EU – in particular, our Ally Lithuania – by orchestrating irregular migrant flows on Belarus’s border, and most recently the attempted forced repatriation of Belarusian Olympian Krystsyna Tsimanouskaya, who has been offered a humanitarian visa by Poland.  These acts of transnational repression cannot be tolerated and must stop.  The United States stands in solidarity with our Allies and partners in responding to these threats.</p>
<p class="p1">The United States once again calls on the Belarusian authorities to end the crackdown on members of civil society, the media, athletes, students, legal professionals and other citizens, immediately release all political prisoners, engage in a genuine dialogue with the democratic opposition and civil society, as called for in the OSCE Expert Mission report, and hold free and fair elections under international observation.  We will continue working with the international community to hold to account those responsible for human rights violations and abuses in Belarus.</p>
<p class="p2">We stand with the people of Belarus in support of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p class="p1">The Department of State has concluded an administrative settlement with Keysight Technologies, Inc. (Keysight) of Santa Rosa, California, to resolve alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C. § 2751 <i>et seq</i>., and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. Parts 120-130.  The Department of State and Keysight have reached this settlement following an extensive compliance review by the Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance in the Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.</p>
<p class="p1">The Department of State and Keysight have reached an agreement pursuant to ITAR § 128.11 to address alleged <span class="s1">unauthorized exports of </span>technical data, and in this case, software used for testing radar equipment on fixed or mobile platforms.  The settlement demonstrates the Department’s role in strengthening U.S. industry by protecting technical data from unauthorized exports.  The settlement also highlights the importance of obtaining appropriate authorization from the Department for exporting software as well as determining proper export jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="p1">Under the terms of the 36-month Consent Agreement, Keysight will pay a civil penalty of $6,600,000.  The Department has agreed to suspend $2,500,000 of this amount on the condition that the funds will be used for Department-approved Consent Agreement remedial compliance measures.  Also, Keysight must hire an outside Special Compliance Officer for a term of two years and conduct an external audit to assess and improve its compliance program during the Consent Agreement term.</p>
<p class="p1">Keysight disclosed to the Department the alleged AECA and ITAR violations.  However, the Department first alerted Keysight of misclassification concerns and advised Keysight to obtain proper classification for the software through a Commodity Jurisdiction request, which led to the discovery of the violations.  Keysight cooperated with the Department’s review, including submitting one disclosure that acknowledged the charged conduct, implemented remedial compliance measures, and signed a statute of limitations agreement tolling the statutory period.  For these reasons, the Department has determined that it is not appropriate to administratively debar Keysight at this time.</p>
<p class="p1">The Consent Agreement and related documents will be available for public inspection in the <a href="https://foia.state.gov/Search/Search.aspx"><span class="s2">Public Reading Room of the Department of State</span></a> and on <a href="https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/ddtc_public?id=ddtc_kb_article_page&amp;sys_id=384b968adb3cd30044f9ff621f961941"><span class="s2">Penalties and Oversights Agreements</span></a> section of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls’ website.  For additional information, please contact the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs’ Office of Congressional and Public Affairs at <a href="mailto:pm-cpa@state.gov"><span class="s2">pm-cpa@state.gov</span></a>.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) newest report makes it clear – climate change is already a crisis.   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, the United States joined nearly 200 IPCC member governments in approving the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report.  This is the first volume in a series of four reports that the IPCC will release for the Sixth Assessment.  This report evaluates the physical science of climate change – looking at the past, present, and future climate and revealing how human-caused emissions are altering our planet and what that means for our collective future.   </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The report highlights that our climate is rapidly changing due to human influence and is already altering our planet in drastic ways <i>– </i>Arctic sea ice is at its lowest level in more than 150 years; sea levels are rising faster than at any time in at least the last 3,000 years; and glaciers are declining at a rate unprecedented in at least 2,000 years.  Weather and climate events – such as extreme heat, heavy rainfall, fire conditions, and droughts – are becoming more severe and frequent because of clima</span><span class="s2">te change.  We are seeing the detrimental impacts of these events on the lives and livelihoods of people around the world.     </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most importantly, the report finds we are already edging closer to a 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer world, and every day emissions rise the prospects for averting the worst impacts of climate change become dimmer.  This is why it is essential that all countries </span><span class="s3">–</span><span class="s1"> in particular the major economies </span><span class="s3">–</span><span class="s1"> do their part during this critical decade of the 2020s to put the world on a trajectory to keep a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on warming within reach.  This is why the United States has committed to a 50-52 percent reduction in emissions from 2005 levels in 2030 and is marshaling the entire federal government to tackle the climate crisis.  We cannot delay ambitious climate action any longer.   </span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As countries prepare for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, this report is a stark reminder that we must let science drive us to action.  This moment requires world leaders, the private sector, and individuals to act together with urgency and do everything it takes to protect our planet and our future in this decade and beyond.</span></p>
