					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States intends to provide an additional $100 million in civilian security assistance to enhance the capacity of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs to provide essential border security, sustain civil law enforcement functions, and safeguard critical governmental infrastructure in the face of President Putin’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack.</p>
<p>The increased funding will continue a steady flow of personal protection equipment, field gear, tactical equipment, medical supplies, armored vehicles, and communication equipment for the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service and the National Police of Ukraine. With the U.S. government’s vital assistance, Ukrainian law enforcement officers are playing a key role in rescuing victims of the Russian government’s brutal assault, leading and protecting convoys of those displaced by attacks, and providing security to civilian areas torn apart by ruthless and devastating bombing.</p>
<p>The United States continues to stand with the community of nations backing the people and government of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and country. We continue to urge Putin to end the violence, rein in his forces, including those who have committed war crimes, and choose the path of peace and diplomacy. We are committed to pursuing accountability for war crimes and other atrocities using every tool available, including criminal prosecutions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>We strongly condemn this week’s multiple Houthi terrorist attacks on Saudi Arabia, including today’s that struck an Aramco facility in Jeddah, which is clearly civilian infrastructure.</p>
<p>At a time when the parties should be focused on de-escalation and bringing needed life-saving relief to the Yemeni people ahead of the holy month of Ramadan, the Houthis continue their destructive behavior and reckless terrorist attacks striking civilian infrastructure.</p>
<p>We will continue to work with our Saudi partners to strengthen their defenses while also seeking to advance a durable end to the conflict, improve lives, and create the space for Yemenis to determine their own future collectively.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie D. Jenkins will lead the U.S. delegation to the first ever Review Conference of the Parties to the Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, where she will deliver the national statement.  The conference will be hosted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna from March 28 to April 1.</p>
<p>The Convention and its Amendment &#8211; known as the A/CPPNM &#8211; greatly strengthens international peace and security.  It does so by providing an international framework for the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities used for peaceful purposes. It also criminalizes the theft or sabotage of such material and facilities and enhances international cooperation and information sharing among States Parties.  Moreover, when countries implement the A/CPPNM, the nuclear security measures they put in place can enhance public confidence in the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology that are so critical to reaching sustainable development goals.</p>
<p>Today, 164 countries are party to the Convention and 129 to the Amendment, with Brazil recently becoming the 129<sup>th</sup>.  This conference will give all participating countries the opportunity to exchange information on best practices, challenges to implementation, and lessons learned, and to continue momentum toward universalization of the treaty.  Nuclear security is essential to the world’s collective security, and it is vital that all States join the United States and others from all regions of the world as parties to the A/CPPNM.  At the conference, the United States and its partners will work to gain support for a robust and regular review process of the A/CPPNM and a subsequent review conference.</p>

<p>On March 24, Special Representative for the DPRK Sung Kim held separate calls with Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director General for Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau Funakoshi Takehiro and ROK Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Peace and Security Affairs Noh Kyu-duk and they jointly condemned the DPRK’s March 24 ballistic missile launch, the latest in a series of increasingly escalatory launches this year.</p>
<p>Special Representative Kim and his counterparts condemned the launch as a clear violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and as presenting a serious threat to regional stability.  Special Representative Kim underscored the United States’ continued commitment to close trilateral coordination with our Japanese and ROK allies and our continued readiness to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy with the DPRK.  He reaffirmed the shared goal of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of the ROK and Japan.</p>

<p>Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman met today with Italian MFA Secretary General Ettore Sequi in Washington, D.C.  They discussed shared efforts to assist Ukraine in the face of Moscow’s unprovoked and unjustified war, to deliver humanitarian assistance to those fleeing Russia’s aggression, and to press the Kremlin to end its brutal attacks.  They affirmed their two countries’ enduring support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and commitment to holding Putin and his enablers accountable for his war of choice.  Deputy Secretary Sherman and Secretary General Sequi also discussed energy diversification, green power generation, and ways to support the democratic aspirations of the Libyan people.</p>
