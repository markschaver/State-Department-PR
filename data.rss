					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, Brian A. Nichols, attended a senior-level international partners meeting on Haiti on April 21.  Hosted by France, this meeting convened international partner countries and international organizations for the third time in the past four months in support of progress on the challenges facing Haiti.  Participants encouraged political accord among Haitian actors so elections can take place as soon as conditions permit.</p>
<p>On April 1, the United States announced it would partner with Haiti through the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, which complements our existing programming in Haiti.  As the international community encourages Haitian political actors, civil society, and other stakeholders to find consensus and reach a political accord, this is an opportune time for coordinating future support for security, good governance, democratic institutions, and elections.</p>
<p>This meeting also reaffirms our efforts in providing advisory support, training, and other resources to the Haitian National Police (HNP).  In addition to deploying additional trainers and refurbishing HNP training facilities, the United States has delivered 60 new vehicles to the HNP.  The United States is working with HNP leadership to develop an elite unit capable of high-impact arrests and anti-gang operations, as well as expand its community policing efforts to regain the trust of citizens in gang-affected neighborhoods.</p>
<p>We commend our partners who have also contributed to building the operational capacity of the HNP.  We continue to work with international partners and organizations to support Haiti’s response to complex security challenges.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States welcomes <wbr />Czech Defense Minister Jana Černochová’s announcement today to begin negotiating a bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement. When concluded, this agreement will deepen our close security partnership, further strengthen cooperation in NATO operations, and together, contribute to continued growth in Transatlantic security.</p>
<p>The agreement builds on the provisions of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and is similar to other bilateral agreements the United States has concluded with other NATO Allies, including many of the Czech Republic’s neighbors along NATO’s Eastern Flank.  This agreement, when concluded, will help create an overarching framework to codify already existing cooperation between our two militaries, formalizing procedures, and providing a more transparent, predictable, and robust framework for both bilateral and enhanced NATO cooperation.</p>
<p>Our alliances are a tremendous source of American strength.  Since 1993, the United States and the Czech Republic have worked closely together on a wide range of issues important to both countries, the NATO Alliance, and the world.  Opening these consultations with the Czech Republic reflects our commitment to reaffirming and reinvigorating America’s alliances to meet common security challenges while protecting shared interests and values.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his premeditated, unprovoked, unjustified, and brutal war on Ukraine, the ceaseless bombardment of Ukraine’s cities and critical infrastructure by Russia’s forces has created one of the fastest-growing humanitarian crises in decades.  This is a tragic and catastrophic war of choice entirely of Russia’s making, and the United States, its Allies, and partners will stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine in their just cause  ̶  the defense of their country and their democracy. Together, we continue to support Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity and to strengthen Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.</p>
<p>Today, as Russia begins its renewed offensive in Ukraine’s east, I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation from the President, a drawdown to provide further immediate military assistance to Ukraine, valued at up to $800 million worth of arms and equipment from U.S. Department of Defense inventories.  This authorization, building on last week’s $800 million package, is the eighth drawdown of arms, equipment, and supplies from Department of Defense inventories for Ukraine since August 2021.</p>
<p>We will continue to provide Ukraine the arms its forces are effectively using on the ground to defend themselves.  These efforts, combined with direct U.S. humanitarian and financial support to Ukraine, support documenting evidence of Russia’s war crimes against Ukraine’s civilians, and continued efforts to ratchet up pressure on Putin’s crumbling economy together will help weaken the Russian Government’s position and further isolate them from the world until Russia ends its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.</p>
<p>For almost eight weeks, Russia has waged its savage assault against Ukraine, its sovereignty, its independence, its freedom, and its people.  From Bucha to Kramatorsk, from Kharkiv to Mariupol, we have seen Russia’s brutalities and its atrocities laid bare for the world to see.  And yet Ukrainian Winter has turned to Ukrainian Spring.  The people of Ukraine will prevail.</p>

<p>Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman met today in Brussels with Bjoern Seibert, Head of Cabinet of the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. They agreed to continue the close and coordinated transatlantic efforts to support the Ukrainian people and impose severe costs on the Russian Federation for Putin’s war of choice and the abhorrent attacks on civilians in Ukraine.  Both sides underscored a continuing commitment to urge the People’s Republic of China not to circumvent or undermine sanctions against Russia, and not to provide any form of support for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.  Deputy Secretary Sherman reaffirmed the United States’ support for the formal opening of EU accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania as soon as possible.  Both sides highlighted the importance of the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework to our economies and societies, and committed to its swift implementation.</p>
