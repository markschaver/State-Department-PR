					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government of the United States of America, I send my warm wishes to the people of the Kingdom of Belgium as you observe your National Day.</p>
<p>The United States and Belgium have a long and proud history of cooperation, and our close alliance is based on a shared commitment to democracy and human rights.  We fought side by side in two world wars to defend our shared values.  As founding members of NATO, we established the cornerstone of peace, prosperity, and stability the Transatlantic community has enjoyed since then.</p>
<p>The people of the United States mourn with you after the devastating loss of life and destruction from the recent floods.  We trust that Belgium will rebuild and persevere as it has done in the past.  Such perseverance has been evident as we face a global pandemic and continue to stand together.  The fruits of our scientific cooperation have benefited the world.  We are committed to using that same ingenuity in new avenues of partnership, such as working together to combat the climate crisis by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing green infrastructure.</p>
<p>I look forward to creating a more secure and prosperous future for our citizens in the coming year.  Best wishes to the people of Belgium on the occasion of your National Day.</p>

<p>The United States welcomes efforts by Haiti’s political leadership to come together in choosing an interim Prime Minister and a unity cabinet to chart a path forward in the wake of the heinous assassination of Jovenel Moïse.  The formation of this interim government is a positive and necessary step to respond to the Haitian people’s needs and begin restoring Haiti’s democratic institutions.</p>
<p>The United States, together with the international community, urges Haiti’s political and civil society leaders to continue to work together to advance a broad and inclusive dialogue that responds to the needs of the Haitian people and lays the groundwork for long-term stability and prosperity.</p>
<p>We remain committed to supporting the Haitian government’s investigation into the assassination of Jovenel Moïse, expanding COVID-19 vaccination efforts, working with the Haitian National Police to promote security and the rule of law, and coordinating with the international community to establish the conditions necessary for Haitians to vote as soon as feasible.</p>
<p>We call on all Haitians to work together to maintain peace and will continue to support the Haitian people as they strive to build a stable, prosperous, and democratic country.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I extend my warmest wishes to all those celebrating Eid al-Adha in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>This special occasion is a time to reflect on the values of sacrifice, service, compassion, charity, and for helping those less fortunate. As we mark Eid al-Adha this year, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to restrict the ways in which members of religious communities observe holy days and traditions. We honor the Muslims worldwide who are spending the holiday separated from their families and friends and following health and safety guidelines, especially those who were not able to participate in the Hajj pilgrimage. We are hopeful that many pilgrims will have an opportunity to perform their pilgrimage once it is safe.</p>
<p>I wish you all a happy Eid al-Adha.  Eid Mubarak and Hajj Mabrour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<title>Transfer of Parts of Varosha to Turkish Cypriot Control </title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States condemns the announcement by Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan today regarding the transfer of parts of Varosha to Turkish Cypriot control.  This move is clearly inconsistent with UN Security Council Resolutions 550 and 789, which explicitly call for Varosha to be administered by the United Nations.</p>
<p>Since October 2020 when Turkish Cypriots, with the support of Turkey, announced the opening of the Varosha beachfront and began taking actions to implement this decision, Turkish Cypriots and Turkey have ignored calls from the international community and the UN Security Council to reverse their unilateral steps on Varosha.  The United States views Turkish Cypriot actions in Varosha, with the support of Turkey, as provocative, unacceptable, and incompatible with their past commitments to engage constructively in settlement talks.  We urge Turkish Cypriots and Turkey to reverse their decision announced today and all steps taken since October 2020.</p>
<p>The United States is working with like-minded partners to refer this concerning situation to the UN Security Council and will urge a strong response.</p>
<p>We underscore the importance of avoiding provocative unilateral actions that increase tensions on the island and hinder efforts to resume Cyprus settlement talks in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.  We remain supportive of a Cypriot-led comprehensive settlement to reunify the island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation to benefit all Cypriots and the wider region.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good morning, everyone.  And Your Majesty, it is a real pleasure to welcome you to the State Department, the Crown Prince as well.  We couldn’t be more pleased to have you here.  You’ve had already a remarkably busy and I think productive few days in Washington, of course, with President Biden yesterday, with the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, other colleagues.  I know you’re going to be seeing all the leaders on the Hill over the next couple of days.</p>
<p>But I think it’s a reflection of the tremendous value that the United States places on its relationship with Jordan, a remarkable partnership over many years, many decades.  Jordan is a powerful, powerful partner for peace, for stability in the region, dealing with ISIS and terrorism, a remarkably generous host to refugees.  On so many levels, this partnership demonstrates its importance, its value to us.</p>
<p>And I think it’s also powerful evidence in your agenda here that Jordan has long enjoyed and continues to enjoy strong bipartisan support, and that as well is tremendously valuable.  So, we’re so pleased to have you here.  We have a lengthy agenda following up on the meeting with President Biden yesterday.  Lots to talk about, but mostly, welcome.  Welcome to you, Crown Prince, welcome.  It’s so good to have you as well.</p>
<p><strong>KING ABDULLAH</strong>:  Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for those very kind and warm words, and we were all taken by the warmth and generosity of yesterday’s meeting with the President and the First Lady.  And it’s just a reflection, I think, of – not only the old personal relationship, friendship, that I’ve had with the President since he was a senator, when I was a young man, such as my son, with his late Majesty King Hussein.  And I think that’s just a reflection of the – this is a relationship that has just grown so, so much over the years.</p>
<p>And again, as you saw in the meetings yesterday, with all the challenges that we have in our region, how (inaudible) the United States come together in mutual agreement on the challenges that we have.  We have always been very grateful for the support of the United States and the administrations, the Congress, and the American people.</p>
<p>And again, on behalf of all of us, as I said yesterday, we thank this administration for the support on the Pfizer vaccine, which really is, I think, just a testament to the graciousness that you always show our people.</p>
<p>We will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder on the challenges that are in our region, and you know that you can always count on Jordan to be steadfast and always be a loyal, strong ally.</p>
<p>Today, we have a lot to talk about.  We have a lot of work to do.  But as always, I think I say from our part of the world it’s up to many of us in the region to do the heavy lifting on behalf of the United States, because you do so much, and count on Jordan and many of my colleagues to do that heavy lifting over the coming years.  And again, thank you for your kindness and your generosity of words.  And I’m very delighted to be here today.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you, Your Majesty.  Thank you all.</p>
