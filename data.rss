<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken met today with Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau in Washington, D.C., as part of the U.S.-Poland Strategic Dialogue.

The Secretary emphasized the importance of the bilateral relationship and thanked Poland for its leadership on NATO’s Eastern Flank and as OSCE Chair for 2022. The Secretary and the Foreign Minister also discussed bilateral engagement on economic prosperity, clean energy diversification, and shared democratic values.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I send my best wishes to the people of Aotearoa New Zealand as you commemorate the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi on February 6.</p>
<p>Our relationship is one of mutual trust, common values, and unwavering friendship.  We work together to protect our natural environment, champion our diversity and cultures, and ensure a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Our ties continued to deepen in 2021.  I was honored to host Foreign Minister Mahuta at the Department of State during her visit to Washington, D.C., in November 2021.  The United States joined the Christchurch Call to Action to combat online violent extremism, and New Zealand signed the Artemis Accords with NASA, which aims to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.  We maintained a mutually beneficial security relationship – from enhancing interoperability through the visit of the USS Howard to disaster assistance provided by the USS Sampson.  Most recently, the United States and New Zealand worked together to provide humanitarian assistance to Tonga after the volcanic eruptions and tsunami waves.</p>
<p>We continue to stand together and do the <em>mahi</em> – work – as we face global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.  As we look forward to another year of cooperation, I am reminded of the<em> te reo Māori</em> phrase – <em>he waka eke noa</em> – we’re all in this together.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Counselor of the Department Derek Chollet will lead an interagency delegation to Sofia, Bucharest, and Brussels from February 7 to 11 to engage with our partners in Europe on a range of issues, and to consult with NATO Allies and the European Union partners on Russian aggression towards Ukraine.  Counselor Chollet’s trip is a continuation of the extensive diplomacy undertaken with our European Allies and partners in support of a united approach to Russia’s unprovoked <wbr />military build-up along Ukraine’s borders and our joint efforts to encourage Russia to choose diplomacy and de-escalation.</p>
<p>Counselor Chollet will meet with members of Bulgaria’s new government to continue the strategic dialogue talks begun in January 2020 on security, energy, and the rule of law.  In Romania, the Counselor will reaffirm the importance of the U.S.-Romania Strategic Partnership in addressing common threats and challenges, particularly with regard to U.S. troop deployments to help defend European allies in light of Russia&#8217;s military buildup on Ukraine’s borders.  Following both countries’ recent invitations to begin accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, he will offer U.S. support to the governments in their economic reform and anti-corruption efforts.</p>
<p>Counselor Chollet will then travel to Belgium to meet with NATO and European Union officials to discuss recent diplomatic engagements with Russia and joint efforts to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine, including Allies’ and partners’ readiness to impose massive consequences and severe economic costs on Russia.  Throughout his trip, the Counselor will reaffirm our ironclad commitment to NATO and our Allies and discuss how the United States can continue to support NATO countries, particularly on the eastern flank.</p>
<p>For more information about the trip and the United States’ steadfast support for Ukraine, please visit <a href="https://www.state.gov/united-with-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjAyMDQuNTI4ODc3NDEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlLmdvdi9Vbml0ZWRXaXRoVWtyYWluZSJ9.fxa3ymJOR1TV0z2rGSqH1rtw1jATcrOeg_VcfBfQjls/s/1006560560/br/126144448791-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1644066429113000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1wtgK3MZlCTq_KJTLL1WCa">www.state.gov/<wbr />UnitedWithUkraine</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The Department of State is imposing visa restrictions on Belarusian nationals under the “Khashoggi Ban,&#8221; a tool the Administration announced last year to counter transnational repression.  Today’s actions target multiple Belarusian nationals for their involvement in serious, extraterritorial counter-dissident activity.  The United States condemns all such activity, including the attempt to forcibly repatriate Belarusian Olympian Krystsina Tsimanouskaya during the Tokyo Summer Olympic Games last year.</p>
<p>The United States applauds the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation&#8217;s efforts to support and protect the human rights of athletes amid the Lukashenka regime’s violent crackdown and ongoing repression of Belarusians inside and outside the country.  We stand in solidarity with Ms. Tsimanouskaya and all others who have experienced the regime’s attempts to silence criticism.</p>
<p>This action is part of a comprehensive effort to prevent and respond to acts of transnational repression by any government targeting journalists, activists, and dissidents for abuse, bringing together diplomatic, law enforcement, and intelligence tools to deter repressive governments and protect targeted individuals and groups, including within the United States. The Khashoggi Ban, a global visa restriction policy pursuant to Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, is one important tool in this effort.</p>
<p>The United States reaffirms its support for the people of Belarus and once again calls on the Lukashenka regime to end its crackdown on members of civil society, independent media, the political opposition, athletes, students, legal professionals, and other Belarusians; to immediately release all political prisoners; to engage in sincere facilitated dialogue with the democratic opposition and civil society; to fulfill its international human rights obligations; to stop its coercion of vulnerable people and its retaliatory action against governments and groups that assist them; and to hold free and fair elections under international observation.  We will continue working with the international community to hold accountable those responsible for repression and human rights violations and abuses in Belarus.</p>
