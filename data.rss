		<title>Observance of the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States joins the international community in observing the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation and recommits to ending this grave human rights abuse.  The United States recognizes that gender equality and girls’ empowerment are not achievable without prioritizing gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response.  For millions of girls around the world, this means we must act to eliminate female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C).</p>
<p>While girls today are one-third less likely to be subjected to FGM/C compared to three decades ago, the United Nations estimates that progress needs to be at least 10 times faster to meet the global target of FGM/C elimination by 2030.  Efforts to eliminate FGM/C are more pressing than ever as the COVID-19 pandemic has increased girls’ risk of being subjected to the practice.</p>
<p>The United States is committed to preventing and responding to all forms of GBV, including FGM/C.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The text of the following statement was released by the Governments of the United States of America and Poland on the occasion of the U.S.-Poland Strategic Dialogue.</p>
<p><i>Begin Text:</i></p>
<p>The Governments of the United States and Poland held the U.S.-Poland Strategic Dialogue in Washington, D.C. on February 4, 2022, which included consultations between Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau and U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken.  February 4 marks the birth date of General Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a Polish General who two centuries ago fought for American freedom.  The United States and Poland have a historic friendship.  But today we are more than that.  We share not only common values, but also an awareness of shared responsibilities for humanity’s future.</p>
<p>This Strategic Dialogue comes at a critical time.  It demonstrates the strength and importance of the bilateral relationship as the United States and Poland focus on the security challenges on the Eastern Flank of NATO due to Russian aggression.  U.S.-Polish cooperation addresses our shared goals of ensuring security and supporting the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian people as well as the objective of European and Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz and Counselor of the Department of State Derek Chollet opened the Strategic Dialogue.</p>
<p>The United States and Poland emphasized the importance of the U.S.-Poland partnership in addressing common threats and challenges.  The Strategic Dialogue focused on shared values and interests, reaffirming the strong, steady, and deepening bilateral cooperation between the United States and Poland and our joint commitment to enhance cooperation on a broad range of topics.</p>
<p>The working groups of the Strategic Dialogue discussed bilateral cooperation on regional and collective security; political military issues; energy security, including climate change and nuclear energy cooperation; economic prosperity; cooperation in the framework of Three Seas Initiative and strengthening democratic values and institutions through the OSCE in Europe and Eurasia and in our own countries.  The United States and Poland consulted on the importance of Poland’s leadership in the OSCE in reaching diplomatic resolutions to regional conflicts.  Both parties expressed firm dedication to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and committed to coordinating to deter any further Russian aggression.</p>
<p>The Strategic Dialogue was hosted by the U.S. Department of State and included interagency and inter-ministerial representatives from both governments.  The meeting featured senior U.S. representatives from the Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of the Treasury, Department of Commerce, and the National Security Council, and from the Polish side, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Economic Development and Technology, Ministry of Climate and Environment, and Ministry of the Interior and Administration.</p>
<p>Both sides expressed a strong interest in deepening the bilateral strategic partnership in the year ahead and through future strategic dialogues.  The parties plan to hold the next annual meeting in Warsaw in early 2023.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke today by phone with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. They discussed Russia’s military buildup along Ukraine’s borders and steps Ukraine and the United States are taking to encourage Russia to pursue diplomacy over war and ensure security and stability. The Secretary shared with the Foreign Minister his recent engagement with Russian counterparts, which affirmed readiness to address mutual security concerns, the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and made clear U.S. willingness, alongside our Allies and partners, to impose swift and severe consequences on Russia if it chooses to escalate.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Zbigniew Rau, Polish Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, good morning, everyone.  It’s a great pleasure to have my friend, the Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, here in Washington at the State Department, and the timing could not be better in the sense that we have an extremely productive already Strategic Dialogue underway – long scheduled, long time – but of course, we’re also here at a time of real concern for European security because of Russia’s aggressive posture toward Ukraine.</p>
<p>Poland’s partnership, its leadership now of the OSCE, and the work we have done together over these many weeks to make clear to Russia that there are two paths before it: one of dialogue and diplomacy to resolve mutual concerns about security, or the path of aggression and massive consequences for Russia if it chooses that path – we have built these out together in absolute solidarity.  We have in many conversations over these past weeks and months, directly together but also with our colleagues from the – from NATO and the EU, made very clear that we are acting as one.  We strongly prefer that Russia choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue, but if it does not, we are fully prepared for the alternative.</p>
<p>So we have a lot to talk about today and, again, in the context of Poland’s OSCE chairmanship.  That’s a vital forum for Europe’s security and for continuing to look at ways to strengthen that security.  If Russia engages in that arena, that can also, I think, be productive for everyone, but it has to decide whether to do that or not.</p>
<p>But in any event, Zbigniew, it’s very good to have you here.  Thank you for being here and I look forward to our conversation.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER RAU:</b>  Thank you very much.  Tony, I am very happy that we can continue our dialogue.  I am here in the dual capacity as the Polish foreign minister and as the chairman-in-office of the OSCE.  Indeed, from these two perspectives, we have many things to discuss, and what concerns both of us is the extraordinarily difficult situation in and around Ukraine.  And this is the focus of my attention as the chairman-in-office of the OSCE but also as the foreign minister of a trusted ally of the United States.</p>
<p>So the common denominator of these two hats or perspective is that Poland and the U.S. shares the same values.  Our interests are very close, therefore our perspective of the crisis are very, very similar too.  And I must say that what is very important in our dialogue, in our meeting today is really the Strategic Dialogue that has just been relaunched – or this session of Strategic Dialogue between our two countries has been relaunched, and a long-overdue session is taking place, as the Secretary has just indicated – that we enjoy a very fruitful discussion concerning security issues, but also the economic cooperation, and so on and so on.  So these are the things that bring – has brought us together for decades.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.  Thank you very much.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I send my best wishes to the people of Aotearoa New Zealand as you commemorate the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi on February 6.</p>
<p>Our relationship is one of mutual trust, common values, and unwavering friendship.  We work together to protect our natural environment, champion our diversity and cultures, and ensure a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Our ties continued to deepen in 2021.  I was honored to host Foreign Minister Mahuta at the Department of State during her visit to Washington, D.C., in November 2021.  The United States joined the Christchurch Call to Action to combat online violent extremism, and New Zealand signed the Artemis Accords with NASA, which aims to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.  We maintained a mutually beneficial security relationship – from enhancing interoperability through the visit of the USS Howard to disaster assistance provided by the USS Sampson.  Most recently, the United States and New Zealand worked together to provide humanitarian assistance to Tonga after the volcanic eruptions and tsunami waves.</p>
<p>We continue to stand together and do the <em>mahi</em> – work – as we face global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.  As we look forward to another year of cooperation, I am reminded of the<em> te reo Māori</em> phrase – <em>he waka eke noa</em> – we’re all in this together.</p>
