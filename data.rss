					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>During her August 2021 visit to Vietnam, Vice President Kamala Harris affirmed the importance of U.S. and Vietnamese efforts to ensure space activities are conducted in a responsible and sustainable manner.  As part of those joint efforts, U.S. and Vietnamese officials met virtually March 22-24 for the third U.S.-Vietnam Civil Space Dialogue.</p>
<p>The discussion focused on cooperation in space-based Earth observation.  Participants discussed the SERVIR-Mekong project (<a class="external-link" href="https://servir.adpc.net/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://servir.adpc.net/</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>), a partnership with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which helps countries use satellite data to address challenges in food security, natural resource management, climate, air quality, and natural disasters.  Participants also discussed the use of geospatial technologies to assist with disaster management, earth science, and civil maritime domain awareness.  This civil space dialogue reaffirms the depth of cooperation and strength of relations under the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership.</p>
<p>The United States delegation, led by Ambassador Marc Knapper of the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi, included representatives from the Department of State, NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.  The Vietnamese delegation, led by Dao Ngoc Chien, Deputy Director-General of the Department of High Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) for Vietnam, included representatives from MOST, the Ministry of Justice, the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment (MONRE), the Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC), the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), the Ministry of Defense, Vietnamese universities, and the Vietnam National Space Center (VNSC).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and people of the United States of America, I congratulate the people of Greece as you celebrate the 201st anniversary of the founding of the Hellenic Republic.</p>
<p>Today, we celebrate the history and democratic values that unite our countries and peoples.  The United States views Greece as a key partner and NATO Ally as we advance our shared goals for peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, Western Balkans, Black Sea region, and beyond, strengthened by our updated Mutual Defense Cooperation Agreement.</p>
<p>Our relationship has never been more important than at this critical moment in history after the Russian government launched its unprovoked war in Ukraine, including against the Greek diaspora in Mariupol, a bastion of Hellenic identity.  On behalf of the United States, I thank Greece for its unyielding and steadfast support for Ukraine’s people, sovereignty, and democracy.</p>
<p>The founders of the United States drew inspiration from ancient Greece’s example, as they framed the U.S. Constitution and formed the world’s first modern democracy.  Inspired by these democratic ideals, American Philhellenes proudly stood shoulder to shoulder with the people of Greece as they, too, fought for their independence.  Building on the shared values that have guided our friendship for more than two centuries, our relationship is stronger now than ever, fostering security and prosperity for both our countries and the broader transatlantic alliance.</p>
<p>The United States continues to stand with Greece as we deepen our strong and historic relationship and take it to even greater heights, guided by democratic values that were born in Greece.  And so, I wish the people of Greece a year of peace, prosperity, and good health, as we celebrate another year of Greece’s independence.  Xronia Polla!</p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke today with Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa and they jointly condemned the DPRK’s March 24 Intercontinental ballistic missile launch as a clear violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions.  This provocation, which follows two ICBM tests earlier this year, further demonstrates the threat the DPRK’s unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs pose to the DPRK’s neighbors and the broader international community.  Secretary Blinken reaffirmed the U.S.-Japan Alliance as the cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, and committed to trilateral cooperation with Japan and the Republic of Korea towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  The Secretary reiterated the United States’ commitment to the defense of Japan and the Republic of Korea remains ironclad.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States welcomes and strongly supports the declaration today by the Government of Ethiopia of an indefinite humanitarian truce, effective immediately, and the commitment to work in collaboration with humanitarian organizations to expedite the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance to all those in need.  We expect this declaration to be quickly followed by the movement of life-saving assistance.</p>
<p>This commitment to a cessation of hostilities should be a critical step towards the resumption and sustainment of humanitarian assistance to the people in Tigray and all Ethiopian regions and communities in need.  It should also serve as an essential foundation of an inclusive political process to achieve progress towards common security and prosperity for all the people of Ethiopia.  In the context of this commitment, we reiterate our call for an immediate end to the violence committed against civilians by all parties to the conflict and underscore that any lasting solution to the conflict must involve accountability for those responsible for atrocities.</p>
<p>The United States urges all parties to build on this announcement to advance a negotiated and sustainable ceasefire, including necessary security arrangements.  The United States will continue to do everything possible to assist and to help the people of Ethiopia to advance a peaceful future.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States today announced sanctions on five entities and individuals located in Russia and the DPRK and one entity in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) for proliferation activities under the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA).  As part of this action, we imposed sanctions against the Russian entities Ardis Group of Companies LLC (Ardis Group); PFK Profpodshipnik; LLC, and Russian individual Igor Aleksandrovich Michurin; as well as DPRK entity Second Academy of Natural Science Foreign Affairs Bureau (SANS FAB); and DPRK individual Ri Sung Chol (aka Ri Su’ng-ch’o’l) for transferring sensitive items to North Korea’s missile program.  These measures are part of our ongoing efforts to impede the DPRK’s ability to advance its missile program and they highlight the negative role Russia plays on the world stage as a proliferator to programs of concern.</p>
<p>We also are imposing sanctions against the PRC entity Zhengzhou Nanbei Instrument Equipment Co. Ltd for supplying Syria with equipment controlled by the Australia Group chemical and biological weapons nonproliferation regime.  The ongoing imposition of INKSNA sanctions against PRC entities calls attention to the role of PRC entities in proliferation and shortcomings in the PRC’s implementation of export controls and its nonproliferation track record.</p>
<p>These determinations underscore the continuing need for all countries to remain vigilant to efforts by North Korea and Syria to advance their proliferation programs of concern.  We will continue to work to impede these programs and use our sanctions authorities to spotlight the foreign suppliers, such as these entities in the PRC and Russia that provide sensitive materials and technology to the DPRK and Syria.  The sanctions announced today will be in effect for two years and include restrictions on U.S. government procurement, U.S. government assistance, and exports.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Yael  Lempert , Acting Assistant SecretaryBureau of Near Eastern Affairs</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Thanks very much and good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you for joining today’s call. Very pleased to have with us today Acting Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Yael Lempert.  She will preview the Secretary’s travel to Israel, the West Bank, Morocco, and Algeria.  The acting assistant secretary will speak today on the record.  This call is embargoed until its conclusion, and after the acting assistant secretary offers some opening remarks, she will have a couple minutes to answer questions.</p>
<p>So with that I will turn it over to Acting Assistant Secretary Lempert.</p>
<p><strong>MS LEMPERT</strong>:  Great.  Thank you so much, Ned.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Nice to be with you today.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken is going to travel to Israel, the West Bank, Morocco, and Algeria from March 26th to March 30th.  While there, he’s going to engage with our partners on a range of regional and global priorities, including Ukraine, Iran, the Abraham Accords and normalization agreements with Israel, preserving the prospects for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and building support for the UN’s engagement on Western Sahara, among other topics.  Of course, this will be Secretary Blinken’s second visit to Israel and the West Bank as Secretary, but this will be his first visit to Morocco and Algeria since he became Secretary.</p>
<p>During his visit to Israel and the West Bank, the Secretary will underscore the United States’ ironclad commitment to Israeli security, coordination on Ukraine and Iran, and work to build upon the gains from the Abraham Accords.  While there, he will meet with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Foreign Minister and Alternate Prime Minister Yair Lapid, Defense Minister Benny Gantz, and also with Israeli President Isaac Herzog.  The Secretary will also meet with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah as well as with representatives of Palestinian civil society.</p>
<p>During the visit, Secretary Blinken will affirm the commitment of the United States to a two-state solution, and to greater freedom, security, and prosperity for Palestinians and Israelis alike.  He will also underscore the importance of the upcoming month when major religious holidays across faiths will be celebrated, and reiterate the importance of actions to build trust, and enhance stability and security, and the need to avoid steps that can inflame tensions on the ground.</p>
<p>Turning to North Africa, the Secretary will first visit Morocco, where he will meet with Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita and other senior government officials to exchange views on regional issues and bilateral cooperation, and on advancing human rights and fundamental freedom, and he also will engage with Moroccan youth.  While in Rabat, the Secretary will also meet Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss regional security and international developments.</p>
<p>The Secretary’s trip will culminate in Algiers, where he will meet President Abdelmadjid Tebboune and his counterpart Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra to discuss regional security and stability, commercial cooperation, and advancing human rights and fundamental freedom.  The Secretary also will officially inaugurate the United States as the Country of Honor at the Algiers International Trade Fair – it’s the largest trade show of its kind in Africa – and he will meet with U.S. businesses.   During the course of this trip, the Secretary will emphasize to all the foreign leaders he meets with that the U.S. stands in solidarity and support with the government and people of Ukraine.  He will affirm the need for Vladimir Putin to end his premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war on Ukraine.</p>
<p>This region – the Middle East and North Africa – has seen the damaging effects of Russia’s military campaigns before:  In Syria and Libya and Mali, Russian military and paramilitary forces have exploited conflicts for Moscow’s own selfish interests, posing grave threats to regional stability and global commerce.</p>
<p>Putin’s invasion is already causing food prices – especially wheat – to rise, just as our economies recover from the COVID pandemic.  We know this pain is keenly felt in the Middle East and North Africa, where most countries import at least half of their wheat.  Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Qatar, and Tunisia import at least a quarter of their wheat specifically from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Putin’s reckless war will only continue to increase the price of basic staples like bread in the region, taking money from the pockets of the hardest working and most vulnerable families as he invades a sovereign country without provocation.</p>
<p>This war must stop, and we will work hand-in-hand with our partners the world over to get there.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE</strong>:  Terrific.  Operator, if you wouldn’t mind repeating the instructions to ask a question, please.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Thank you.  And again, if you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your touchtone phone.  Again, that’s 1-0.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Let’s start with the line of Jennifer Hansler of CNN.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Yes.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Great.  Thank you.  I was wondering whether the Secretary intends to bring up with President Bennett their – his outreach to President Putin, whether the U.S. finds these efforts helpful, if there’s going to be any effort to get on the same page in Bennett’s diplomacy with Putin.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS LEMPERT:</strong>  Thank you.  Yes, we do anticipate that we’ll be discussing Ukraine in Israel and elsewhere as well, but in Israel we’ll be discussing Israel’s efforts.  We appreciate Israel’s role.  So that will be on the agenda.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  We’ll go to the line of Humeyra Pamuk of Reuters.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks for doing this.  Just a couple of quick ones.  Just to follow up from Jennifer, how much of this trip do you think will be about Russia, Ukraine, given Israel’s emerging role as a potential mediator?  Because the Iran deal is also a big topic.  Like how – which one is going to dominate?</p>
<p>And a quick question on Secretary’s meeting with Abu Dhabi crown prince.  The relationship has not been at its best, to say the least, and there seems to be an expectation on the Emirati side for concrete proposals.  Will the Secretary have those in his suitcase, and what will those be?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS LEMPERT:</strong>  Great.  Thanks for that question.  In terms of our engagement on Ukraine and discussing Russia’s invasion and war against Ukraine, that will be a topic I’m sure at all of our stops, as well, I anticipate, Iran, which as you know is an issue that is of great interest to all of our partners in the region.  So it’s difficult for me to predict at this moment what will dominate.  What I can predict with assurance is that both of those are going to be really at the top of the agenda in terms of our discussions.</p>
<p>In terms of the meeting with the crown prince, look, we’re taking advantage of the opportunity during the Secretary’s visit to Morocco to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and really have a strategic conversation about the full range of regional, international issues before us.  This is a valued and really important strategic relationship for us, and it’s an opportune moment for this meeting.  There’s a lot to discuss.  So we’re pleased to have this chance to sit down, the Secretary is, with the crown prince as strategic partners and discuss the full range of issues before us.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  We’ll go to John Hudson of <em>The Washington Post</em>.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Is the Secretary going to push the consulate issue while he’s in Israel?  Is that a campaign promise that’s just basically falling by the wayside in wake of Israeli opposition?</p>
<p><strong>MS LEMPERT:</strong>  That will certainly be a topic of discussion in his meetings in both Israel and the West Bank.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Nahal Toosi.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hey, guys.  Thanks for doing this.  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Halley, you are – I think we’ve lost you.  Unless we can get you &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I’m here.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  We can now.  Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Yes, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Sorry about that.  Former Secretary of State Pompeo issued a ruling for –  decision that said that the U.S. did not see the Israeli settlements in the West Bank as being illegal.  And to my knowledge, Secretary of State Blinken has not reversed that position.  Now, tell me if I’m wrong.  But is it the Biden administration’s policy that the Israeli settlements are not illegal under their – our version of international law?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS LEMPERT:</strong>  I have no update for you on that particular topic.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  We’ll go to the line of Paul Handley.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Inaudible) tell us what those issues are.  Can you go through the list?  What are the priorities to discuss, because there’s a lot of things I could name, but why don’t you – can you just talk about them?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Paul, we missed the top of your question.  What was your whole question?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  The question is could you go – you said there’s a whole list of things to talk about with Mohammed bin Zayed.  Can you go through that list, please?  Hello?</p>
<p><strong>MS LEMPERT:</strong>  Hi.  Thank you.  Sorry.  Yes, there’s a wide range of issues, ranging from Iran to Yemen, Syria, global energy markets, and Ethiopia.  We have a range of topics that we’ll be discussing, as well as the Abraham Accords and what we can do to strengthen those further.  We have seen tremendous and tangible results in terms of the UAE-Israel relationship.  It’s really blossomed.  Tourism is thriving; direct flights are ferrying numbers of tourists back and forth.  Trade is booming.  And we anticipate that that will be a big topic of discussion as well.  We’ll probably also touch briefly on the Expo, which has really been a tremendous success, closing soon in Dubai.  That’s just a sampling.  I mean, we have just a wide array of shared interests and topics that we want to cover.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  We have time for a final question or two.  Let’s go to Yuna Leibzon of Channel 12.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I do want to focus on Israel.  You talked about priorities in different countries.  But can you say what would be the first priority on the visit and the meeting in Israel?  Would it be Iran, or the Russia-Ukraine negotiations, or Palestinian issues, if you could focus that specifically, please?</p>
<p><strong>MS LEMPERT:</strong>  Look, our relationship with Israel is so broad and so deep, it’s difficult to choose just one issue and say that’s going to be the priority.  As I mentioned previously on this call, we’ll be certainly discussing Iran, as we have had close consultations on that topic since the beginning of the administration; Russia-Ukraine, no doubt; again, Abraham Accords and what we can do to try and strengthen and broaden them; and of course, Israeli-Palestinian issues and what we can do in terms of helping to lower tensions and see movement forward on that front, in addition to a range of other bilateral topics.  So it will be a broad and wide-ranging discussion.  There’s no doubt in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  And we’ll conclude with the line of Said Arikat, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Inaudible) Madam Assistant Secretary.  Very quickly, I want to follow up on John Hudson’s question on the consulate.  Now, last year Secretary Blinken stated in no uncertain terms that the consulate will be reopened.  Are we likely to hear anything that is as strong in terms of a commitment to the consulate this time around?</p>
<p>And my second question regarding the village of Al-Walaja that is slated to be demolished, will the Secretary of State express that his opposition or – his clear opposition to the demolition of this particular Palestinian village?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS LEMPERT:</strong>  Thank you.  Look, as I mentioned before, the issue of our consulate general in Jerusalem will undoubtedly be a topic of discussion in the Secretary’s meetings both in Israel and the West Bank, and he’ll be speaking to it there.</p>
<p>In terms of your question about demolitions, I think that that will be among the topics that is discussed.  I will say that the State Department has made the administration’s view clear.  We believe it is critical for Israel and the Palestinian Authority to refrain from unilateral steps that exacerbate tensions and undercut efforts to advance a negotiated two-state solution.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Thank you very much, everyone.  Thank you very much, Acting Assistant Secretary Lempert.  Appreciate everyone’s time.  Again, this call was on the record, and we will be seeing many of you on the ground during the trip.  Talk to you then.</p>

<p>Yael  Lempert , Acting Assistant SecretaryBureau of Near Eastern Affairs</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Thanks very much and good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you for joining today’s call. Very pleased to have with us today Acting Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Yael Lempert.  She will preview the Secretary’s travel to Israel, the West Bank, Morocco, and Algeria.  The acting assistant secretary will speak today on the record.  This call is embargoed until its conclusion, and after the acting assistant secretary offers some opening remarks, she will have a couple minutes to answer questions.</p>
<p>So with that I will turn it over to Acting Assistant Secretary Lempert.</p>
<p><strong>MS LEMPERT</strong>:  Great.  Thank you so much, Ned.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Nice to be with you today.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken is going to travel to Israel, the West Bank, Morocco, and Algeria from March 26th to March 30th.  While there, he’s going to engage with our partners on a range of regional and global priorities, including Ukraine, Iran, the Abraham Accords and normalization agreements with Israel, preserving the prospects for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and building support for the UN’s engagement on Western Sahara, among other topics.  Of course, this will be Secretary Blinken’s second visit to Israel and the West Bank as Secretary, but this will be his first visit to Morocco and Algeria since he became Secretary.</p>
<p>During his visit to Israel and the West Bank, the Secretary will underscore the United States’ ironclad commitment to Israeli security, coordination on Ukraine and Iran, and work to build upon the gains from the Abraham Accords.  While there, he will meet with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Foreign Minister and Alternate Prime Minister Yair Lapid, Defense Minister Benny Gantz, and also with Israeli President Isaac Herzog.  The Secretary will also meet with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah as well as with representatives of Palestinian civil society.</p>
<p>During the visit, Secretary Blinken will affirm the commitment of the United States to a two-state solution, and to greater freedom, security, and prosperity for Palestinians and Israelis alike.  He will also underscore the importance of the upcoming month when major religious holidays across faiths will be celebrated, and reiterate the importance of actions to build trust, and enhance stability and security, and the need to avoid steps that can inflame tensions on the ground.</p>
<p>Turning to North Africa, the Secretary will first visit Morocco, where he will meet with Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita and other senior government officials to exchange views on regional issues and bilateral cooperation, and on advancing human rights and fundamental freedom, and he also will engage with Moroccan youth.  While in Rabat, the Secretary will also meet Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss regional security and international developments.</p>
<p>The Secretary’s trip will culminate in Algiers, where he will meet President Abdelmadjid Tebboune and his counterpart Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra to discuss regional security and stability, commercial cooperation, and advancing human rights and fundamental freedom.  The Secretary also will officially inaugurate the United States as the Country of Honor at the Algiers International Trade Fair – it’s the largest trade show of its kind in Africa – and he will meet with U.S. businesses.   During the course of this trip, the Secretary will emphasize to all the foreign leaders he meets with that the U.S. stands in solidarity and support with the government and people of Ukraine.  He will affirm the need for Vladimir Putin to end his premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war on Ukraine.</p>

<p>Putin’s reckless war will only continue to increase the price of basic staples like bread in the region, taking money from the pockets of the hardest working and most vulnerable families as he invades a sovereign country without provocation.</p>
<p>This war must stop, and we will work hand-in-hand with our partners the world over to get there.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will travel to Israel, the West Bank, Morocco, and Algeria March 26-30 to consult with partners on a range of regional and global priorities, including the Russian government’s war on Ukraine, Iran’s destabilizing activities, the Abraham Accords and normalization agreements with Israel, Israeli-Palestinian relations, and preserving the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, among other topics.</p>
<p>The Secretary will start his trip in Israel and the West Bank.  There, he will meet with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Foreign Minister and Alternate Prime Minister Yair Lapid, Defense Minister Benny Gantz, and Israeli President Isaac Herzog.  The Secretary will underscore the unwavering U.S. commitment to Israel’s security, engage on Israeli-Palestinian issues, and discuss regional and global challenges with his counterparts in the Israeli government.  The Secretary will also meet with President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah as well as with representatives of Palestinian civil society.  In these meetings, the Secretary will emphasize the importance of strengthening U.S.-Palestinian relations, and advancing freedom, security and prosperity for the Palestinian people.</p>
