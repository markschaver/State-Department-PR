					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Mukhtar Tileuberdi, Kazakhstani Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good morning everyone, and welcome to our friends and colleagues.  It’s very good to have Foreign Minister Tileuberdi here today.  We have been strategic partners with Kazakhstan for 30 years, something that we value very much.  We very much support as well the important efforts at political and economic reform that are taking place now in Kazakhstan.  This long relationship is one girded by our strong commitment to Kazakhstan’s independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity.</p>
<p>We have a lot to talk about today in terms of the region, security.  What we’re seeing among other things from Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine are profound impacts beyond Ukraine, including in Central Asia – food, energy, trade – and we’re working to address all of these second and third order effects of the aggression.</p>
<p>So Mukhtar, it’s very good to have you here.  Thank you for being here, and I look forward to a good conversation.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER TILEUBERDI:</strong>  Dear Secretary of State, thank you for the invitation to visit Washington, D.C., and for the warm welcome.  And I am here today with a special mission to deliver our key messages, to reaffirm our steadfast commitment to further advance our Enhanced Strategic Partnership with the United States.</p>
<p>Just also using this opportunity, I would like to thank you for your initiative to the ministerial meeting on global food security.  I participated in New York this 18 of May, and I believe that it was important and timely event to address the actual issues and the challenges, which is very important especially for our region of Central Asia.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks, everyone.</p>

		<title>Revocation of Five Foreign Terrorist Organizations Designations and the Delisting of Six Deceased Individuals as Specially Designated Global Terrorists</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p align="left">Today, the Department of State is announcing the revocation of five Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designations under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA): Basque Fatherland and Liberty, Aum Shinrikyo, Mujahidin Shura Council in the Environs of Jerusalem, Kahane Chai, and Gama’a al-Islamiyya.  All five organizations will remain designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT) entities under Executive Order 13224.  The Department is retaining these SDGT designations for a number of reasons, including to support law enforcement actions or ensure frozen assets are not released to still active individual terrorists.</p>
<p align="left">In addition to these five FTO revocations, the Department of State is also announcing the revocation of six now deceased individuals as SDGTs designated under Executive Order 13224: Abu al-Wardah, Mohad Moalim, Farah Mohamed Shirdon, Musa Abu Dawud, Aliaskhab Kebekov, and Ibrahim al-Rubaysh.</p>
<p align="left">As required by the INA, the Department reviews FTO designations every five years to determine if the circumstances that were the basis of the designation have changed in such a manner as to warrant a revocation.  Our review of these five FTO designations determined that, as defined by the INA, the five organizations are no longer engaged in terrorism or terrorist activity and do not retain the capability and intent to do so.  Therefore, as required by the INA, these FTO designations are being revoked.</p>
<p align="left">These actions are intended to reflect the United States’ resolve to comply with legal requirements to review and revoke FTO designations when the facts compel such action.  These revocations do not seek to overlook or excuse the terrorist acts each of these groups previously engaged in or the harm the organizations caused its victims, but rather recognize the success Egypt, Israel, Japan, and Spain have had in defusing the threat of terrorism by these groups.  Revoking FTO designations and the delisting of deceased individuals ensures our terrorism sanctions remain current and credible and does not reflect any change in policy towards the past activities of any of these terrorists or of the organizations in which they were members.</p>
<p align="left">The United States remains committed to combating the activities of terrorists worldwide.</p>

<p>Lotte The Palace New York</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Liz, thank you.  Thank you for those truly overly generous words.  But the one part of that that’s true is that we’ve had a relationship going back many, many years (inaudible).  It’s something that I’ve had the opportunity to be involved in over many years now.  And I have to tell you I think the mission that you’re leading is arguably more important (inaudible).  It’s something that we’ve known (inaudible) for a long, long time, but the fact of the matter is if we’re not engaged, if the United States is not there, then usually there’s a vacuum that’s going to wind up being filled by bad things before it’s filled by good things.  And you have been promoting, advancing the proposition that U.S. leadership, U.S. engagement, matters.  It makes a difference.</p>
<p>And I think we’ve seen that in the case of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.  I’m proud of the fact that we’ve stood up in terms of our support for Ukraine itself – security, economic, and humanitarian.  I’m proud of the fact that we’ve brought dozens of countries along in exerting necessary pressure on Russia to end the aggression.  And I’m proud of the fact that we’ve also been able to strengthen our own Alliance, our defensive Alliance, NATO.</p>
<p>But having said all of that, I’m equally proud of the extraordinary response that we’re seeing from the private sector, a response some of which I’ve seen firsthand, including in Poland – our friend (inaudible), just to cite one of many, many, many examples – but really stepping up for the Ukrainian people, responding to the extraordinary humanitarian needs that exist, but also beginning this conversation about the longer term and how we think about rebuilding, because the devastation that’s been wrought on Ukraine and big parts of its economy are quite staggering and are going to require a lot.</p>
<p>So I was really anxious to get together with this group.  I’m grateful for the fact that you’ve taken the time to do this today, because it’s an opportunity for us to hear a little bit about what the experience has been to date in finding different ways to support Ukrainian people in Ukraine, but also what your thoughts are for going forward and the extent to which this has shaped your own thinking about engagement on these issues, because something as significant, as dramatic, and as deep-rooted as this also gets us thinking about how we do things (inaudible) to do things going forward.</p>
<p>So I’m really grateful for this conversation and anxious to be listening in order to hear from each of you, so thank you.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Good afternoon. President Shahid, Director General Vitorino, thank you for your leadership at this first International Migration Review Forum. These are unprecedented times. There are more migrants on the move around the world today than at any time since World War II, some 95 million. As people leave their homes in search of safety and opportunity, undertaking perilous journeys, it’s critical that countries and institutions work together to make migration safer and more orderly.</p>
<p align="left">Forging that common approach to managing migration and protecting vulnerable people is the intention of the Global Compact for Migration. The United States supports that vision. We seek migration policies that are grounded in human rights, human dignity, transparency, and state sovereignty. And we’re committed to partnering with civil society, with governments, the private sector, and international institutions like the United Nations, because this is a challenge that no one of us can solve alone.</p>
<p align="left">The countries here today have taken important steps since the Global Compact was adopted in 2018. For example, several of our neighbors in the region have provided legal status and services to people fleeing repression and made education available to their children. International organizations and nongovernmental groups are providing support after climate-related disasters and training local officials in climate resilience and adaptation to help communities that are now threatened with being displaced because of the climate crisis. We also welcome efforts by civil society to keep governments focused on human rights and humanitarian assistance, because migration is not an abstract notion. Every migrant is a human being deserving of dignity and protection.</p>
<p align="left">The United States will work closely with our partners to build on the progress that’s being made. Next month, at the Summit of the Americas, we’ll continuing developing a collaborative response to irregular migration throughout our hemisphere where the issue is particularly acute. Together, we’re working on the root causes of irregular migration, including a lack of economic opportunity, insecurity, corruption and repressive governance, climate-related emergencies, to address why people are leaving their homes in the first place. For example, Vice President Kamala Harris rallied the private sector to invest more than a billion dollars to create economic opportunities in Central America.</p>
<p align="left">We’re working to expand legal pathways for migration, including allocating more than 50,000 additional temporary worker visas this year, expanding family reunification programs, and funding support for vulnerable migrants and refugees around the globe.</p>
<p align="left">We’re also helping to improve protections for migrants worldwide, in part through our work with the International Organization for Migration and the International Labor Organization, to combat human trafficking and to promote ethical cross-border job recruitment.</p>
<p align="left">There’s another migration issue that is front of mind today. Almost 13 million people have fled or been displaced in Ukraine since President Putin’s war began in February. I want to commend the countries that are welcoming Ukrainian refugees and supporting the humanitarian response. We remain united in supporting Ukraine and opposing this senseless war.</p>
<p align="left">The United States will continue to work for safe, orderly, and humane migration around the world. As a nation built and enriched by immigrants, this issue is particularly close to our hearts. Thank you to everyone here for your commitment, and we very much look forward to our work in the months and years ahead. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>For nearly 12 weeks, Russia has waged its unprovoked and brutal war against Ukraine, its sovereignty, its territorial integrity, and its people.  Beaten back from its failed attempt to seize Kyiv, Russia continues a grinding offensive across Ukraine’s south and east.  Ukraine’s courageous defense forces remain firmly in the fight.  The United States, as well as more than 40 Allies and partner countries, are working around the clock to expedite shipments of arms and equipment essential to Ukraine’s defense.</p>
<p>Pursuant to a delegation from the President, I am authorizing our tenth drawdown of additional arms and equipment for Ukraine’s defense from U.S. Department of Defense inventories, valued at up to $100 million.  This brings total U.S. military assistance to Ukraine to approximately $3.9 billion in arms and equipment since Russia launched its brutal and unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24.</p>
<p>U.S. and international military assistance continues to complement direct U.S. financial support to Ukraine, support for documenting evidence of Russia’s atrocities against the people of Ukraine, and measures to continue ratcheting up the pressure on Russia and its remaining enablers.  Taken together, these efforts strengthen Ukraine’s position at the negotiating table while continuing to isolate Russia from the world until it ends its senseless and brutal war of choice against Ukraine.   The United States is committed to helping Ukraine continue to meet its defense needs and build its future capabilities, as well as to bolster Allies and partners across NATO’s Eastern Flank and the broader region.</p>
<p>The United States, our allies, and our partners are proud to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine in their just cause:  the defense of their country and their democracy.  United with our Allies and partners, we will succeed, and a democratic, sovereign, and independent Ukraine shall prevail.</p>
