					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Over the past year, People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Hong Kong officials have systematically undermined Hong Kong’s democratic <wbr />institutions, delayed elections, disqualified elected lawmakers from office, and forced officials to take loyalty oaths to keep their jobs.  Since protests began in 2019, local authorities have arrested thousands for speaking out against government policies with which they disagreed, including for their social media posts and for attending vigils.  Journalists have been arrested simply for doing their jobs in reporting on the government’s activities and repressive efforts against protesters.  Hong Kong authorities have mounted a persistent and politically motivated campaign against the free press, imprisoned <em>Apple Daily</em> founder Jimmy Lai, and forced the closure of that publication – a bastion of independent reporting.  Beijing has chipped away at Hong Kong’s reputation of <wbr />accountable, transparent governance and respect for individual freedoms, and <wbr />has broken its promise to leave Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy unchanged for 50 years.</p>
<p>We will continue to stand up for the rights and freedoms guaranteed to people in Hong Kong by the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.  In the face of Beijing’s decisions over the past year that have stifled the democratic aspirations of people in Hong Kong, we are taking action.  Today we send a clear message that the United States resolutely stands with Hong Kongers.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting Accountability:  </strong>The Department of State has designated Chen Dong, Yang Jianping, Qiu Hong, Lu Xinning, Tan Tieniu, He Jing, and Yin Zonghua, who are Deputy Directors of the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (LOCPG).  The LOCPG is the PRC’s main platform for projecting its influence in Hong Kong and has repeatedly undermined the high degree of autonomy promised for Hong Kong in the Sino – British Joint declaration. The seven officials are being designated under Executive Order 13936.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency:  </strong>Hong Kong’s business environment has deteriorated in the past year.  The many legal, financial, operational, and reputational risks long present in mainland China are now increasingly prevalent in Hong Kong.  A healthy business and investment climate requires a transparent regulatory framework and adherence to the rule of law.  Today, the Department of State, together with the Department of Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of the Treasury, released a <a href="https://www.state.gov/risks-and-considerations-for-businesses-operating-in-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTA3MTYuNDMzMDU2MDEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZS5nb3Yvcmlza3MtYW5kLWNvbnNpZGVyYXRpb25zLWZvci1idXNpbmVzc2VzLW9wZXJhdGluZy1pbi1ob25nLWtvbmcvIn0.WMzMcPnWSjxXqKMU3F9ypPhhJK-B_12EK7tP3Kcr-38/s/1039202793/br/109440623462-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626535512298000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEw_vwTjBH_9urEqCFSNvwrw2ytVA">Business Advisory </a>warning of increased risks for businesses in Hong Kong.  These risks include those introduced by the National Security Law and other new legislation, potential electronic surveillance and lack of data privacy, reduced access to information, and potential retaliation <wbr />against companies for their compliance with U.S. sanctions.  The business advisory outlines these emerging risks to inform U.S. individuals and businesses and recommends increased awareness and due diligence.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Representatives of the United States, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan agreed in principle to establish a new quadrilateral diplomatic platform focused on enhancing regional connectivity.  The parties consider long-term peace and stability in Afghanistan critical to regional connectivity and agree that peace and regional connectivity are mutually reinforcing.  Recognizing the historic opportunity to open flourishing interregional trade routes, the parties intend to cooperate to expand trade, build transit links, and strengthen business-to-business ties.  The parties agreed to meet in the coming months to determine the modalities of this cooperation with mutual consensus.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is deeply troubled by the Georgian Parliament’s July 12 approval of six Supreme Court nominees, in contravention of the April 19 agreement between ruling and opposition party representatives.</p>
<p>Mediated by the EU and the United States under the auspices of European Council President Charles Michel, the April 19 agreement committed the signatories to pause &#8220;all ongoing appointments&#8221; to the Supreme Court until passage of &#8220;ambitious judicial reform&#8221; in a broad, inclusive, and multiparty reform process.</p>
<p>We urge Georgia’s authorities to implement the April 19 agreement, including by suspending Supreme Court appointments pending comprehensive, transparent, and inclusive judicial reform.  This is what Georgia’s political leaders, including the ruling party, agreed to do.  Failure to do so would further undermine the Georgian public&#8217;s and international community&#8217;s confidence in Georgia&#8217;s judiciary and risk undermining Georgia’s democratic development.  Incomplete implementation of the April 19 agreement could also weaken investor confidence and diminish the resilience of Georgia’s political and social institutions.</p>
<p>The United States calls on Georgian authorities to restore their commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law, while reinvigorating their partnership with the United States and international community.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p style="margin: 0in; background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Open sans',serif; color: black;">Today’s announcement that Saad Hariri is resigning as Prime Minister-designate is yet another disappointing development for the Lebanese people.</span></p>
<p style="background: white; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;"><span style="font-family: 'Open sans',serif; color: black;">It is critical that a government committed and able to implement priority reforms be formed now.  The government must also start preparing for the 2022 parliamentary elections, which should be held on-time and conducted in a free and fair manner.</span></p>
