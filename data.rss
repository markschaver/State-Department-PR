					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today, we are announcing the public designation of Guatemalan Congressperson Boris España Cáceres, due to his involvement in significant corruption. In his official capacity, España has been involved in corrupt acts, including bribery and interfering with public processes, that jeopardized the stability of Guatemala’s democratic institutions and the Guatemalan public’s confidence in its representatives. Furthermore, España remains in office despite widespread awareness of his involvement in significant corruption, which reflects a history of impunity in the Republic of Guatemala’s government institutions.</p>
<p>This designation is made under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2021. Under this authority, once the Secretary of State designates officials of foreign governments for their involvement, directly or indirectly, in significant corruption, those individuals and their immediate family members are ineligible for entry into the United States. In addition to España, the Department is publicly designating the following members of España’s immediate family: his spouse, Liliana Maria Umaña Lemus de España; his daughter, Karol Andrea España Umaña; and his minor child.</p>
<p>This designation reaffirms U.S. commitment to combatting the corruption and impunity that plagues Guatemala and other nations in the region. The Department will use all available tools to promote accountability for corrupt actors in this region and globally.</p>
<p>For more information, please contact <a href="mailto:INL-PAPD@state.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INL-PAPD@state.gov</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry traveled to the Middle East and North Africa June 13-17 to discuss collaboration on combating climate change and raising climate ambition ahead of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change later this year and beyond.  All visited countries enthusiastically engaged in discussions on the need for increased action to address climate change, the importance of a successful COP26, and prospects for enhanced climate cooperation with the United States.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Yesterday, an overwhelming majority of Organization of American States (OAS) member states sent a clear message of support for the Nicaraguan people and their fight for free and fair elections, respect for human rights, and accountability. The resolution approved yesterday condemns the Ortega-Murillo regime’s repression in Nicaragua and calls for the immediate release of the four presidential candidates recently detained, along with over 130 other political prisoners. It also concludes that, in the wake of the regime’s recent repression and its lack of meaningful electoral reform, the conditions for free and fair elections this November do not exist. The United States strongly supports the OAS Permanent Council’s call for President Ortega to take urgent action to restore full respect for human rights and to create the conditions for free and fair elections.</p>
<p>It is time for the Ortega-Murillo regime to change course, respect both its own constitution as well as its commitments under the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and allow the Nicaraguan people to fully exercise their rights—including their right to choose their leaders in free and fair elections. We look forward to continuing to work with OAS member states, as well as other democratic governments around the world, including with our partners in the European Union, to press for greater freedom for the Nicaraguan people. Through yesterday’s vote, the members of the OAS made clear that Ortega and Murillo’s actions have no place in this hemisphere, given our shared commitments to democracy and human rights.</p>

<p>Yesterday, an overwhelming majority of Organization of American States (OAS) member states sent a clear message of support for the Nicaraguan people and their fight for free and fair elections, respect for human rights, and accountability. The resolution approved yesterday condemns the Ortega-Murillo regime’s repression in Nicaragua and calls for the immediate release of the four presidential candidates recently detained, along with over 130 other political prisoners. It also concludes that, in the wake of the regime’s recent repression and its lack of meaningful electoral reform, the conditions for free and fair elections this November do not exist. The United States strongly supports the OAS Permanent Council’s call for President Ortega to take urgent action to restore full respect for human rights and to create the conditions for free and fair elections.</p>
<p>It is time for the Ortega-Murillo regime to change course, respect both its own constitution as well as its commitments under the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and allow the Nicaraguan people to fully exercise their rights—including their right to choose their leaders in free and fair elections. We look forward to continuing to work with OAS member states, as well as other democratic governments around the world, including with our partners in the European Union, to press for greater freedom for the Nicaraguan people. Through yesterday’s vote, the members of the OAS made clear that Ortega and Murillo’s actions have no place in this hemisphere, given our shared commitments to democracy and human rights.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Today marks the tenth anniversary of the unanimous endorsement by the UN Human Rights Council of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). These principles recognize a three-pronged approach to protecting human rights in the context of business activity: States have the duty to protect human rights; businesses have a responsibility to respect human rights; and victims affected by business-related human rights issues should have access to remedy. We commemorate the achievements made over the last decade in these areas, and take heed of the substantive work that still needs to be done toward realization of these principles.</p>
<p>Businesses can provide crucial support for democratic principles, including respect for human and labor rights. They have the capacity to help shape society and the environment – raising local wages, improving working conditions, building trust with communities, and operating sustainably. As a result, businesses have a key role in addressing human rights abuses, including throughout their value chains.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the next decade, we must go further in shaping the business and human rights agenda. This will take concerted efforts by governments, businesses, and other stakeholders. Doing so is not only the right thing to do but the smart thing to do. We know that companies thrive and economies prosper when there is strong rule of law and adherence to human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as respect for international labor, environmental, and technical standards, good governance, and accountable institutions. Businesses in the rapidly evolving emerging technology sector have a particular opportunity to shape its deployment and establish guardrails against misuse. There also needs to be more attention on the leverage wielded by investors, including private equity, venture capital firms, and multilateral development banks to address human rights abuses, including those committed against environmental defenders. That is why today I am pleased to announce that the State Department, working with the White House and other federal departments and agencies, will soon begin the process of updating and revitalizing the United States’ National Action Plan (NAP) on Responsible Business Conduct.</p>
<p>The Department is renewing its commitment to advance business and human rights under the framework set out in the UNGPs, and in comparable provisions in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, which were updated 10 years ago as well. As we look forward to the next decade under the UNGPs, we recognize there is still much work to be done. The success of future efforts to build upon the UNGPs will depend upon maintaining the approaches that have made them such a success.</p>
