<p>Canada, Mexico, and the United States share a close relationship based on shared values and priorities. We acknowledge that working together as North America we can bring new ideas and energy to the hemisphere, and we commit to reinvigorating how we address together the issues of our time. As three likeminded countries, we affirm our strong commitment to democratic principles and intend to cooperate closely to stand up for multilateralism and the rules-based international order, support the rule of law, promote inclusive growth, invest in the development of communities, protect and promote human rights, advance gender equality, and reinforce democracy at home and inspire democratic development around the world. We worked together towards ending the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to create the conditions for equitable growth and strengthening North American competitiveness. On the occasion of today’s North American Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in Los Angeles, our three countries commit to further enhancing our deep partnership and to continue working together in support of peace and prosperity around the globe.</p>
<p>We reaffirm our support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and condemn Russia’s unprovoked invasion of its sovereign and democratic neighbor in violation of international law. Canada, Mexico, and the United States have repeatedly condemned civilian deaths resulting from Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and stated the importance of upholding international law, including the UN Charter. We also emphasize the urgent need to allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need. These are principles that sustain our rules-based order. We affirm the need to ensure accountability in relevant national and international courts for crimes committed, without exceptions, and support the work of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine established by the Human Rights Council. We are united in our continued support for the people of Ukraine. We also express our commitment to work together in support of those suffering around the world from the global impacts of this invasion, particularly vulnerable populations now experiencing greater food and economic insecurity.</p>
<p>Our coordinated responses to Russian aggression against Ukraine, including calls to establish a diplomatic path forward, demonstrate the importance of North American solidarity. We call on the Russian Federation to withdraw immediately all its military forces and equipment from within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine and return to a path of dialogue and diplomacy. Canada,</p>
<p>Mexico, and the United States – as close hemispheric partners and friends – are committed to further strengthening our relations, which is key to our collective security and prosperity.</p>
<p>We reaffirm our commitment to addressing the root causes of irregular migration and poverty and to investing in the region – prioritizing cooperation for development to create economic opportunity for all. In particular, the three governments are united in efforts towards investing in initiatives that directly benefit the most marginalized communities. We support multilateral efforts to develop value chains and physical infrastructure in the Americas that will generate employment and equitable growth. We acknowledge that addressing irregular migration in the region requires a coordinated approach, and we support the Regional Conference on Migration, the Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework and the vision of the Global Compact on Migration.</p>
<p>We celebrate the tradition of our region in welcoming refugees and migrants, and we recognize the positive contributions of refugees and migrants to the socio-economic development of their host communities. We applaud the sustained efforts of States in our hemisphere in ensuring safe, orderly, and regular migration by hosting refugees, providing regular migration pathways, promoting local economic and social integration, facilitating voluntary return, and supporting the reintegration of returnees. We remain committed to collectively leveraging the benefits of migration while addressing its challenges in countries and communities of origin, transit, destination, and return.</p>
<p>We are committed to continuing our cooperation to support and strengthen Haiti’s democratic process, including through our collective efforts to promote an inclusive, Haitian-led political path forward. We are also committed to working closely with the United Nations and other regional partners to promote peaceful, fair, and sustainable growth throughout the hemisphere.</p>
<p>We reaffirm our commitment to protect human rights, particularly for members of vulnerable and historically marginalized communities, like the LGBTQI+ and two spirit community, and afro-descendant communities, as well as the rights of Indigenous peoples. We also stress the importance of individual freedom of expression and media freedom, and together advocate for addressing impunity and inequality.</p>
<p>We collectively commit to taking bold, swift, and coordinated action to address the climate crisis. Climate change threatens our economies and our communities, especially those who are vulnerable and underserved. As we work to address the climate crisis, we recognize the tremendous opportunity to build back better, to create well-paying and reliable jobs in ever-growing markets, and to position North America as a global leader in clean energy solutions.</p>
<p>As partner countries in championing development in the Americas, we reaffirm our commitment to advancing feminist approaches, eliminating structural and indirect barriers for women, girls and marginalized people, and to integrate gender perspectives in our shared priorities. We continue to advocate for feminist approaches for a more effective, fair, relevant and accountable United Nations in support of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>We recognize the integral place of Indigenous peoples in North America, and their contributions to the diversity and richness of our culture and society. We acknowledge that cultural diversity and linguistic plurality are part of the heritage of humanity, so we place great value in the historical and cultural legacy of indigenous communities in the region.</p>
<p>By recognizing the historical legacy towards indigenous communities, our vision aims to achieve real progress towards reconciliation and a renewed relationship based on respect, truth, cooperation, partnership, and in recognition of the rights of Indigenous peoples. We reiterate our unwavering commitment to ensure that Indigenous rights, interests, and aspirations are recognized in decision-making. We intend to work together, in partnership with Indigenous peoples from our three countries, to attain our goals of safety, security, well-being, socio-economic development, and empowerment for all Indigenous peoples. We also recognize that ending violence against Indigenous women and girls requires a holistic, multidimensional, and multi-sectoral approach.</p>
<p>During our meeting today, we also discussed planning for the next North American Leaders’ Summit in Mexico in December.</p>
<p>We look forward to our increased cooperation in the years to come.</p>

		<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Los Angeles, California</p>
<p>Los Angeles Convention Center</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good morning, everyone.  It’s a great pleasure to be here in Los Angeles with my friends and partners from Mexico and from Canada.  Foreign Minister Ebrard, Foreign Minister Joly, thank you for joining us today.  Simply put, Mexico and Canada are our two literally and figuratively closest partners in the hemisphere.  We are working together every single day on the issues that have animated this summit, including working together to try to engage the COVID challenge, the climate challenge, the migration challenge, the technology challenge that each of our countries faces.  And I think we are brought together by a common conviction that we are going to be much more effective in dealing with these challenges when we work together than when we stand alone.  And that’s been the spirit that’s animated the relationships among us, including at the North American Leaders’ Summit that President Biden and President López Obrador and Prime Minister Trudeau have animated so strongly.</p>
<p>Our ability to coordinate, collaborate, cooperate is going to make a huge difference in actually advancing the various initiatives that this summit is launching or reinforcing.  So I welcome this opportunity for us to compare notes as we head into the final day of the summit, and to look not just at the three days that we spent together here in Los Angeles, but the next 362 days to work together to make good on the commitments that we share.</p>
<p>So with that, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:  </strong>Good morning.  Thank you very much, Antony, in the first place for the warm reception for the Mexican delegation, and congratulations for the summit.  Really amazing, the organization and everything.  Thank you very much for that.</p>
<p>Hello, Mélanie.  Nice to meet you – to see you again and the Canadian delegation.  It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p>As Antony Blinken mentioned, we have a lot of things to work on daily – daily – because it’s a very intense relationship between our countries.  And we have common purposes in order to prepare the North American Leaders’ Summit this year, which is going to be held in Mexico, maybe Mexico City.  And so we have right now some results for the summit which are very positive in our view, from the Mexico view – point of view, regarding the America prosperity, all the continent prosperity in the next months and years, how to recover from pandemic, how to coordinate our efforts in order to strengthen our inter-American organizations, and how to deal with a regional approach for migration and labor mobility.</p>
<p>So a lot of work to do, and we have a very positive relationship, very honest one between us, and we hope that we are going to have this meeting today, other steps ahead in our common objectives.  Thank you very much, Antony.  Thank you, Mélanie.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:  </strong>Thank you, Tony, for hosting us.  It’s always a pleasure to see you.  We’ve been seeing each other a lot over the past months.  Good to see you, Marcelo, as well, and thank you for organizing this meeting.  It is the first meeting of the foreign ministers of the three countries together, so I hope this becomes a tradition, and of course we will work on preparing the North American Leaders’ Summit which will be happening in Mexico, and I think, Marcelo, you just said to the press Mexico City.</p>
<p>So at the same time, we will work on many issues.  Tony mentioned them, from climate change to the question of the impacts of the pandemic and migration.  Of course, we’ve seen strong support throughout the hemisphere about the importance of what is happening in Ukraine.  We need to make sure that we continue to have that strong unity across the hemisphere.  And we will talk about how we can continue to address the impacts of this war, including on the question of food security, food prices, and the impacts of – also on gas prices.  So affordability is also a part of the discussions we’ll be having today.</p>
<p>So thank you both.  It’s a pleasure to be working with you again.</p>
<p>(In French.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  (In French.)</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) And of course, what it is in our thoughts now are the impacts of the war in Ukraine, impacts not only in Ukraine but throughout the world, here in the hemisphere, in our continent.  We know the geopolitical impacts of the war are huge, specifically when it comes to food and gas prices.  Thank you very much.</p>

<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good morning, everyone.  It’s a great pleasure to be here in Los Angeles with my friends and partners from Mexico and from Canada.  Foreign Minister Ebrard, Foreign Minister Joly, thank you for joining us today.  Simply put, Mexico and Canada are our two literally and figuratively closest partners in the hemisphere.  We are working together every single day on the issues that have animated this summit, including working together to try to engage the COVID challenge, the climate challenge, the migration challenge, the technology challenge that each of our countries faces.  And I think we are brought together by a common conviction that we are going to be much more effective in dealing with these challenges when we work together than when we stand alone.  And that’s been the spirit that’s animated the relationships among us, including at the North American Leaders’ Summit that President Biden and President López Obrador and Prime Minister Trudeau have animated so strongly.</p>
<p>Our ability to coordinate, collaborate, cooperate is going to make a huge difference in actually advancing the various initiatives that this summit is launching or reinforcing.  So I welcome this opportunity for us to compare notes as we head into the final day of the summit, and to look not just at the three days that we spent together here in Los Angeles, but the next 362 days to work together to make good on the commitments that we share.</p>
<p>So with that, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN SECRETARY EBRARD:  </strong>Good morning.  Thank you very much, Antony, in the first place for the warm reception for the Mexican delegation, and congratulations for the summit.  Really amazing, the organization and everything.  Thank you very much for that.</p>
<p>Hello, Mélanie.  Nice to meet you – to see you again and the Canadian delegation.  It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p>As Antony Blinken mentioned, we have a lot of things to work on daily – daily – because it’s a very intense relationship between our countries.  And we have common purposes in order to prepare the North American Leaders’ Summit this year, which is going to be held in Mexico, maybe Mexico City.  And so we have right now some results for the summit which are very positive in our view, from the Mexico view – point of view, regarding the America prosperity, all the continent prosperity in the next months and years, how to recover from pandemic, how to coordinate our efforts in order to strengthen our inter-American organizations, and how to deal with a regional approach for migration and labor mobility.</p>
<p>So a lot of work to do, and we have a very positive relationship, very honest one between us, and we hope that we are going to have this meeting today, other steps ahead in our common objectives.  Thank you very much, Antony.  Thank you, Mélanie.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:  </strong>Thank you, Tony, for hosting us.  It’s always a pleasure to see you.  We’ve been seeing each other a lot over the past months.  Good to see you, Marcelo, as well, and thank you for organizing this meeting.  It is the first meeting of the foreign ministers of the three countries together, so I hope this becomes a tradition, and of course we will work on preparing the North American Leaders’ Summit which will be happening in Mexico, and I think, Marcelo, you just said to the press Mexico City.</p>
<p>So at the same time, we will work on many issues.  Tony mentioned them, from climate change to the question of the impacts of the pandemic and migration.  Of course, we’ve seen strong support throughout the hemisphere about the importance of what is happening in Ukraine.  We need to make sure that we continue to have that strong unity across the hemisphere.  And we will talk about how we can continue to address the impacts of this war, including on the question of food security, food prices, and the impacts of – also on gas prices.  So affordability is also a part of the discussions we’ll be having today.</p>
<p>So thank you both.  It’s a pleasure to be working with you again.</p>
<p>(In French.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  (In French.)</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER JOLY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) And of course, what it is in our thoughts now are the impacts of the war in Ukraine, impacts not only in Ukraine but throughout the world, here in the hemisphere, in our continent.  We know the geopolitical impacts of the war are huge, specifically when it comes to food and gas prices.  Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Magic Box</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We appreciate, Secretary, this interview.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Via interpreter) My name is Alejandro.  Thank you for being on SinEmbargo.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  (In Spanish.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Via interpreter) So the president of Mexico did not come to this summit, but that will be solved with a future meeting in July at the White House.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And – but the thing is, what about – (in Spanish) – the OAS &#8212;</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) What about the OAS?  There’s been pressure for so many countries about the utility of the OAS.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  So two things.  First of all, President Biden is very much looking forward to seeing President López Obrador at the White House in July.  They have a very good relationship, great mutual respect, and as do I with my friend and counterpart Marcelo Ebrard.  We talk all the time.  And in this case, we had a good-faith difference of opinion.  That’s – and that’s fine.  I’m very happy that Marcelo is here leading the Mexican delegation, and Mexican civil society and so many others, business leaders, all here at the summit.  So Mexico is very strongly represented, and that’s good.</p>
<p>When it comes to the OAS, listen, this is an organization that we – the United States supports, and its mission, among other things, is to try to uphold the principles that are enshrined in the Democratic Charter of our hemisphere, a charter that really was launched at a Summit of the Americas in 2001, and should be a common document for all of us to be held accountable to.  And the OAS works to do that.  Sometimes that creates some friction, but it’s important that we be held accountable to our democratic principles.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Via interpreter) So why did the U.S. decide not to invite certain countries to this summit, even though the president of Mexico asked for that, and when this is a summit that’s intended – intention is to work on structural problems like inequity and poverty in the Americas?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Yeah.  Well, first I would say that a number of those countries are here.  They are at the summit.  I met yesterday with Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, all of whom are representing their country, from civil society, from the human rights community, from the artistic community.  They are as representative – I would argue more representative – of their countries than their governments at this point in time.  So they’re here; those countries are all here at the summit.</p>
<p>And of course, in a different way, as I said, Mexico is fully here with a very strong delegation led by my friend and counterpart, the Foreign Minister Ebrard.  As I said, we had a very respectful difference of opinion on this.  Usually the host country makes the decisions, and we felt it was important at this time to reinforce the Democratic Charter of our hemisphere, and to remind people that we’re supposed to be joined by these democratic principles, and the countries here should reflect that.</p>
<p>But again, all of these countries actually are here.  It may not be in some cases their governments or regimes, which really do not have popular legitimacy.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Thank you very much for being here, Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  <em>Gracias</em>.  Thank you so much.  <em>Gracias.  </em>Nice to meet with you.</p>

<p>Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman met today with Thongphane Savanphet, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, in Vientiane.  The Deputy Secretary reaffirmed the United States’ strong support for Lao sovereignty and economic development and underscored the importance of ASEAN centrality and regional stability.  The Deputy Secretary thanked Laos for its participation at the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit and noted the summit demonstrated how the United States prioritizes its relationship with Southeast Asian partners.  The Deputy Secretary and the Deputy Foreign Minister discussed ways to deepen U.S.-Laos cooperation in several areas underpinned by ASEAN unity, respect for human rights, and the rule of law.  The Deputy Secretary highlighted our two countries’ cooperation as current Mekong-U.S. Partnership co-chairs.  Deputy Secretary Sherman also condemned Putin’s war of choice against Ukraine and discussed the impact of Putin’s decision on the global economy. Deputy Secretary Sherman also urged Laos to press for progress on implementing ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus in Burma.  The Deputy Secretary emphasized the importance of war legacy cooperation, our robust U.S.-Laos unexploded ordnance clearance program, and the United States’ continued support to Laos’ COVID-19 recovery efforts.</p>

<p>The United States intends to provide $25 million to the Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) to prioritize support for countries in Latin America, such as Ecuador and Costa Rica, should they become eligible.  The funding would support programs benefitting refugees and asylum seekers, such as registration processes, the extension of social services, and integration programs, and would benefit host communities that have generously opened their doors to the most vulnerable.  Expanding support to middle-income countries that host large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers, is critical to integrating these refugees and providing access to vital social services.</p>
<p><strong>Global Concessional Finance Facility (GCFF)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Created in 2016 with strong support from the United States, the GCFF provides longer-term development support on a concessional basis to middle-income countries around the world impacted by refugee crises. The GCFF is a financial intermediary fund housed at the World Bank that works to support country programs targeting refugees and asylum seekers and the host communities where they are located.</li>
<li>The GCFF works in partnership with the World Bank Group, the Inter-American Development Bank, the United Nations, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank to assist countries in bridging the development-humanitarian divide as they manage the long-term needs of refugees and host communities.</li>
<li>The GCFF currently supports programs in Colombia, Ecuador, Jordan, Lebanon, and Moldova. Over $760 million in approved grant funding from the GCFF has supported financing in excess of $3.5 billion for projects in these countries.  To be eligible for GCFF grant funding, countries must put in place and maintain strong refugee protection policy frameworks.</li>
<li>In addition to the United States, the GCFF has benefitted from financial support from Canada, Denmark, the European Commission, Germany, Japan, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. To date, the United States has contributed almost $100 million to the GCFF.  This $25 million in additional support will leverage lending from the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank to facilitate refugee and asylum seeker access to housing, social services, and employment opportunities while supporting development in host communities that facilitates integration.</li>

<p>President Biden announced at the Ninth Summit of the Americas nearly $314 million in new humanitarian, health, economic, and development assistance for Venezuelan refugees and vulnerable migrants across the hemisphere.  This assistance includes nearly $103 million from the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) and over $171 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance to support vulnerable Venezuelans inside Venezuela and those who have sought refuge throughout Latin America and the Caribbean as well as $40 million in development funding through USAID.</p>
<p><strong>Nearly $103 Million in Department of State Humanitarian Assistance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This new funding through PRM supports a wide range of life-saving humanitarian programs for Venezuelan refugees and migrants, such as emergency shelter; access to health care; water, sanitation, and hygiene supplies; increased access to education; support for livelihoods; COVID-19 support, and protection for vulnerable groups including survivors of gender-based violence, children and adolescents, LGBTQI+ persons, and indigenous people in seventeen countries including Argentina, Aruba, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curacao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guyana, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>$171 Million in USAID Humanitarian Assistance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This new funding through USAID will provide humanitarian relief for vulnerable Venezuelans in Venezuela and emergency food assistance for Venezuelan migrants and refugees in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Venezuela Regional Refugee and Migrant Response</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More than 6.1 million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, making it the largest external displacement of persons in the Hemisphere’s history. Of those, more than 5 million have sought refuge throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Many are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance such as access to shelter, education, health, and in some cases, international protection.  The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these needs and increased the vulnerability of Venezuelan refugees and migrants, along with the host communities that have welcomed them, throughout the region.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>PRM leads in providing U.S. humanitarian assistance, protection, and solutions for refugees, asylum seekers, migrants in situations of vulnerability, and stateless persons and works in close coordination with USAID. PRM’s response, through the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and other international and nongovernmental organization partners has been a comprehensive approach with programs targeted to the country-specific challenges faced by Venezuelan refugees and migrants.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>PRM’s Regional Refugee Coordinators located in Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama coordinate humanitarian diplomacy; liaise with national and local government officials, civil society, donor country representatives, UN officials, and aid recipients; and monitor and evaluate PRM-funded programs in the region.</li>
