					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States has now shared over 500 million safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine doses, free of cost, to more than 110 countries and economies around the world – for the sole purpose of saving lives.</p>
<p>Since the start of the pandemic, we have provided nearly $20 billion in health, humanitarian, economic, and development assistance to over 120 countries, including rapid response support for urgent health needs and technical assistance to expand vaccine access.  We have also invested and supported the expansion of regional COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing in Africa and Asia. Today, we continue to work tirelessly with governments and international organizations, vaccine producers, NGOs, the private sector, and others to deliver vaccines, get shots in arms, increase testing and treatment, support and protect healthcare workers, and more.  Our recently announced <a href="https://www.state.gov/the-covid-19-global-action-meeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjAzMTcuNTUwMzcyNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZS5nb3YvdGhlLWNvdmlkLTE5LWdsb2JhbC1hY3Rpb24tbWVldGluZy8ifQ.gIFO23O6JBG30mThVQJIkcGcNXxqG57hpbhHnVFpxrs/s/2171565732/br/128251539481-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1647601262513000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1P4JH42BRHaT8S00Aveyqv">COVID-19 Global Action Plan</a> provides a clear roadmap for this international coordination.</p>
<p>Our work is making a difference around the world.</p>
<p>In Paraguay, our donation of two million Pfizer vaccine doses were quickly administered.  The government set up a mass vaccination site based on a U.S. model and administered 500,000 doses within a week.  In Zambia, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) used American Rescue Plan Act funds to support the administration of nearly two million COVID-19 vaccines through more than 500 health facilities across Zambia’s 10 provinces as part of its work to combat HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>In addition, a State Department grant helped Alfred Kankuzi in Malawi build his own app to respond to the rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation across social media.  Called COVID-19 NEBA, or “Hey Neighbor,” the app is offered in three languages – Chichewa, Tumbuka, and English – and increases access to fact-based information from trusted sources including U.S. Centers for Disease Control, World Health Organization, and Malawi’s Ministry of Health.  Alfred has helped over 648,000 fellow citizens access accurate COVID-19 information.</p>
<p>In Thailand, State Department exchange alumni used a small grant to support Chiang Dao residents in the Chiang Mai Province.  Alumni joined community organizations to create visual and audio media in seven local languages on COVID-19 prevention best practices, collaborated with public health officials to conduct COVID-19 prevention workshops for village health volunteers, and provided effective communication tools and techniques to village leaders to help residents stay updated on COVID-19 – reaching more than 70,000 people.</p>
<p>This work is critical because this pandemic is not over.  Many lives are still at risk globally as countries contend with Omicron and we face the possibility of new variants.  The United States will continue to work with partners and communities at every level to save lives and better prepare for future pandemics.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The International Court of Justice today issued a significant ruling in Ukraine’s case against the Russian Federation under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The ruling clearly and unequivocally ordered Russia to immediately suspend the military operations Russia commenced last month and further directed Russia to ensure that anyone subject to its direction, including military or irregular armed units, take no steps in furtherance of such military operations.</p>
<p>The Court – which plays a vital role in the peaceful settlement of disputes under the UN Charter – stressed the need for States to act in conformity with their obligations under international law, including the laws of war.  And the Court expressed deep concern about the extreme vulnerability of the civilian population of Ukraine, the numerous civilian deaths and injuries that have resulted from the Kremlin’s actions, and the significant material damage, including the destruction of buildings and infrastructure.  The Court further noted its profound concern with the Russian government’s use of force and emphasized the Court’s acute awareness of “the extent of the human tragedy that is taking place in Ukraine” as well as the “continuing loss of life and human suffering.”  The Court also observed that it did not possess any evidence substantiating Russia’s claims that genocide had been committed by Ukraine in the Donbas region.</p>
<p>We welcome the Court’s order and call on the Russian Federation to comply with the order, immediately cease its military operations in Ukraine, and to establish unhindered humanitarian access in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The United States will continue to act with our allies and partners in support of Ukraine.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Following the government of Somalia’s failure to meet another self-established deadline of March 15 for the completion of its parliamentary electoral process, the United States is expanding the number of Somali individuals subject to visa restrictions.</p>
<p>I am taking this action pursuant to a policy I announced on February 8, under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, to restrict the issuance of visas for those believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining the democratic process in Somalia.</p>
<p>While encouraging progress has been made over the past few weeks, there are still more than three dozen unfilled parliamentary seats.  There are continued credible reports of procedural irregularities.  Journalists and opposition party members working to support democratic institutions and transparent processes have been targeted with harassment, intimidation, arrest, and violence.</p>
<p>We will continue to evaluate additional designations under this policy and other tools at our disposal to promote accountability and support the rapid conclusion of Somalia’s electoral process in a credible and transparent manner.</p>
<p>The United States strongly supports the Somali people and remains committed to working to advance democracy and mutual prosperity.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-UkraineRussia"></a><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> One element at the top, and then I look forward to your questions.</p>
<p>As the President said today, America stands with the forces of freedom in Ukraine.</p>
<p>To that end, we are leading the effort to isolate President Putin on the global stage while also simultaneously strengthening Ukraine’s hand at the negotiating table. What’s at stake here are the principles of freedom, the right to determine one’s own future. A right that Ukrainians have shown the world they will fight to preserve.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the United States has sent $300 million in humanitarian aid – tens of thousands of tons of food and medicine for displaced families fleeing Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war. U.S. humanitarian aid personnel are on the ground in the region assessing needs in real time.</p>
<p>And just as President Biden pledged we would, we have also surged security assistance to our Ukrainian partners so that they can defend themselves.</p>
<p>As Russia began its military buildup last year, the United States delivered $650 million in military equipment to Ukraine, building on a growing security cooperation relationship dating back to 2014.</p>
<p>As the conflict started, we sped 350 million more in equipment to help bolster Ukraine’s defenses.</p>
<p>Now, this week we are authorizing $1 billion more of arms and equipment, including types already used successfully by Ukraine’s security forces to defend their country against Russian aggression.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement nearly doubles total security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the administration to more than $2 billion, enabling us to surge additional needed assistance, including anti-aircraft, anti-tank, anti-armor systems as well as small arms and munitions used by Ukrainian security forces on the ground right now in their fight to defend their country.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-_Hlk98341488"></a> Among the items included in this new package are 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems; 2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems; 100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems; 100 grenade launchers, 500 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, and 400 shotguns; in addition to over 200 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds; and more.<sup><a id="post-325172-endnote-ref-1" href="#post-325172-endnote-1"></a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the U.S.-produced short-range air defense systems the Ukrainians have been using to great effect, the United States has also identified and is helping the Ukrainians acquire from our partners and allies additional, longer-range systems on which Ukraine’s forces are already trained, as well as additional munitions for those systems.</p>
<p>The United States continues to expedite the authorization and facilitation of additional assistance to Ukraine from our allies. At least 30 countries have provided security assistance to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. In 2022, this year, the Department of State has authorized third-party transfers of defensive equipment from more than 14 countries, a number that continues to grow as allies and partners increase their support to Ukraine.</p>
<p>As the President said, this could be a long and difficult battle, but America will be steadfast. America will continue to answer the call. The United States, our allies and partners, we are united in supporting Ukraine in its time of need.</p>
<p>With that, happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks, Ned. I actually – I have some Iran questions, but I guess we’ll start with Ukraine because I think that’s probably on the top of everyone’s mind. When you speak about additional long-range systems that you – longer-range systems that the Ukrainians are already trained in, you’re talking about the S-300s, or are you talking about – is it broader than just that? And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, so, Matt, what we are doing and what I referred to now is the fact that we are continuing to pursue solutions to help our Ukrainian partners acquire long-range anti-aircraft systems and the munitions they would need for those systems, and the President also alluded to this in his remarks today. I can’t get into the full specifics of this, but we are continuing to work with our allies, with our partners to surge new assistance, and that includes Soviet or Russian-origin anti-aircraft systems and the necessary ammunition to employ them every day to Ukraine. Those are the systems on which they’re already using, the systems on which they are already trained and have actually demonstrated great effect already.</p>
<p>We have said that we welcome assistance from countries around the world. As I mentioned a moment ago, more than 30 countries across the globe have provided defensive security assistance to Ukraine. The United States has – the Department of State, I should say, has authorized the provision of U.S.-origin equipment from at least 14 countries, but we know that &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right, but &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; many more are standing up.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But this isn’t U.S.-origin?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That’s correct. That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So without getting into the actual nitty-gritty specifics of what systems they are and what countries, although it would be nice to know what countries you’re in discussions with about this, what does the U.S., if anything, have to do to facilitate the transfer of such systems? And secondly, can you – I mean, are you close to reaching an agreement with any of the potential donor countries?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What do we have to do to facilitate the transfer of non-U.S.-origin equipment?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, yeah, legally – correct.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So first, for U.S.-origin equipment, of course there are waivers that are necessary given ITAR provisions and other applicable provisions. The Secretary has repeatedly, with more than 14 countries, authorized the provision of such U.S.-origin equipment to our Ukrainian partners, and we’ve done so on an extremely expedited basis, turning those around in the course of a day.</p>
<p>When it comes to working with countries that may have Russian-made, Soviet-origin equipment, obviously that is not equipment for which we would need to provide any sort of waiver or any sort of formal paperwork. What we are doing, however, is sharing our assessment of the security needs that our Ukrainian partners have – precisely the needs they have, the threat they are under, the types of fires and munitions that they are enduring from President Putin’s forces, and working with them to determine what they may have in their inventories, to marry that with what we have in our inventories, with our knowledge, with their knowledge of what the Ukrainians already have, the training they already have, to determine the most effective package that will allow them to defend themselves.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, are you – can you say if you’re close to an agreement with any – or is it &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We are having these discussions every day. Thirty countries around the world have already provided security assistance to Ukraine, and we’re having these discussions daily.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, and then the last one is just that – and if a deal is struck, and I realize it’s a hypothetical, so you probably won’t answer, but let me try anyway – if you do get a country X or country Y, or both X and Y, to provide Ukraine with these systems, is – are you – is the U.S. prepared to make up for those? Because I mean presumably if country X and Y give those systems to Ukraine, the Russians most likely aren’t going to want to sell them replacements, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I will &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So is the U.S. going to be, or any ally – are you in discussions to replace those systems that countries might give up?</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-NATOUkraine"></a><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I always appreciate when you answer the question for me. I will note that that is a hypothetical. I will also note, however, that we have continued to provide forms of reassurance to our allies, including our allies on the eastern flank. The Department of Defense recently spoke of the two Patriot missile batteries that had been moved into Poland. We know that countries that are valiantly standing up, that are providing defensive weaponry from their own stocks, they too have their own security needs. When it comes to the NATO Alliance, certainly we will continue to stand by our NATO Allies to make certain that NATO has the power, the capability to defend itself.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just a quick one. I have a – there are – I think there are drones in the package of new equipment. I wonder if you can confirm that there are these Switchblade drones are part of that, and any details you can give.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’ve seen quite a bit of reporting over the last 24 hours on that particular system. I think I understand why, when you see the video of it. Look, I can’t confirm particular systems. The President did speak of, or we did speak of tactical unmanned aerial systems. We provided and are providing a hundred of those systems. The system that you referred to would be an anti-armor system. It is certainly consistent with the type of defensive weaponry that we’re providing. But I’m just not in a position to speak to all the specific systems that may be included in that package.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, then can we move onto the negotiations, discussions going on between the Ukrainians and the Russians?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-UkraineRussia2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> There are some signs, some noises coming from both sides that there might be some movement on that. I wondered if you had a view on the potential for an agreement there, and there’s a discussion about an agreement that would see Ukraine kind of pledge neutrality, not join NATO, like a Sweden or Austria kind of neutrality, and then also have security guarantees from other countries. Could the U.S. be a guarantor of some kind of an agreement like that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we welcome the sentiments expressed that there is hope, that there is optimism for diplomatic progress. But what Ukraine needs now more than sentiments, more than hope, more than optimism, is de-escalation, is an end to the violence, is a tangible indication that President Putin is changing course. And that is something we have not yet seen. And just as I was coming down here, there are more horrifying reports of shelling, of destruction of what appear to be civilian sites across Ukraine, including in Mariupol.</p>
<p>We’ve made clear that we unequivocally support Ukraine’s efforts to achieve peace, to bring an end to the mounting human suffering from President Putin’s war of choice. Diplomacy is always going to be at the center of these efforts. But we remain clear-eyed, as do our Ukrainian partners, as you heard from President Zelenskyy, as you’ve heard from the foreign minister, as you’ve heard from others. It remains our position that Russia needs to halt its campaign of death, of destruction immediately. And we are working simultaneously to do all we can to give Ukraine the strongest hand it can have at the negotiating table, and we’re doing that in a couple different ways.</p>
<p>We’ve already spoken to one of those ways at the top of this briefing when we detailed some of the security assistance that we’re providing to Ukraine, $2 billion over the past year, $1 billion in the past week alone. That is certainly an important element of that. The other part of that effort to strengthen Ukraine’s hand at the negotiating table is what the United States and our allies and partners have brought to bear on the Kremlin, on the Russian Federation, including its economy and its financial system.</p>
<p>We have placed unprecedented pressure on the Russian economy, on its financial system, and every day you see very tangible metrics of that. The stock market remains closed, will remain closed for at least the remainder of this week and potentially even longer, presumably in an effort to prevent capital flight. The ruble is virtually worthless; it is literally worth less than a penny. Russia is on the verge of default; its credit rating is at junk status. Hundreds of international companies are fleeing the Russian market. And we can go on and on.</p>
<p>Now, all of that is part and parcel of our effort to strengthen that Ukrainian position. So we see Ukraine day by day will have a stronger hand as these measures have even more effect on the Russian economy, on the Russian financial system, and as we, together with our allies and partners here, too, continue to provide Ukraine with the defensive security assistance that our Ukrainian partners need to defend themselves inside their own territory.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I just wanted to dig on that a little further, Ned, because certain export controls exist on some of these systems that the two gentlemen mentioned. So is the State Department going to take the lead in talking to allies and easing those export controls, or maybe changing them altogether? And especially given Ukraine’s desperate need, how can you work through those obstacles to maybe get them the aid that they need faster, especially with the export &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I think we have proven throughout the course of this conflict, and even before it, that we are not going to let any sort of technical barrier stand in our way. And I’ve already spoken to the expedited procedures that we have used to approve the provision of U.S.-origin equipment to Ukraine. We have done that in many cases with less than 24 hours notice. The fact that – it was just a couple weeks ago that we announced an additional $350 million in security assistance to Ukraine; within four or five days, more than 70 percent of that vast sum had already been delivered.</p>
<p>So I think that speaks to the fact that we are breaking through not only what might be otherwise burdensome bureaucratic processes and hoops, but we are doing so with alacrity here in this department. Our colleagues at the Department of Defense are doing the same. We know that our allies and partners around the world are doing the same on their end precisely because we recognize the urgency with which our Ukrainian partners need these defensive supplies.</p>
<p>So if there are procedures that we need to go through here at the Department or elsewhere within the government to see to it that appropriate and effective systems are provided to our Ukrainian partners, whether that is from our stocks, whether that is U.S.-origin materiel from the stocks of our allies and partners, or materiel that is non-U.S.-origin, that may even be Russian-made or Soviet origin, we will see to that.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-NATO"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes. So Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister Kaczyński, Jarosław Kaczyński, was in Kyiv yesterday along with leaders of Poland and Czechia and Slovenia. And he called for a peacekeeping mission to Ukraine with the involvement of NATO troops. So is that something that the U.S. would be willing to entertain?</p>
<p>And somewhat relatedly, President Zelenskyy yesterday said that he would like to see more leaders coming to visit him. Are there any chances of U.S. officials doing that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So on your first question, of course, it’s not up to us to speak for NATO. What I can say is essentially what we have heard from the NATO secretary general, is that the Alliance of course is squarely focused on putting an end to this war, bringing this brutal aggression to a close. Just as NATO is, we are intently focused on doing the same. In the same vein, we want to avoid doing anything that would prolong this war or that would expand this war. And having American service members on Ukrainian territory, American pilots in Ukrainian airspace, NATO service members on Ukrainian soil, NATO pilots in Ukrainian airspace – of course that has the potential not to bring this war to a close but to expand it to something that is even larger and much more grave in terms of its implications.</p>
<p>In terms of U.S. officials visiting Ukraine, you’ll know that it was just last week that Secretary Blinken met with his foreign minister counterpart, Foreign Minister Kuleba, on the Polish-Ukrainian border. They actually conducted part of that meeting on sovereign Ukrainian soil, the very sovereign – very sovereignty that Ukrainians are so valiantly and bravely and courageously standing up to defend.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right, but that – it’s a little bit different than going to Kyiv and meeting with Zelenskyy. Stepping across the – I mean, not that it wasn’t a symbolic show of support or anything, but there are no plans to do similar to what the three European &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The White House has announced plans for the President to go to Brussels. That is the only presidential travel I’m aware of at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Oh, yeah. I’m talking about – okay. Well, but I’m talking about lower than the President. I mean, and just to follow up on Simon’s question earlier about this idea of neutrality and security guarantees, is this something – I realize that you said that what Ukraine needs right now – what they need immediately is de-escalation and a sign that Putin has changed his – changing course. But in the more medium term, is this something that you guys are willing to consider? Because, frankly, I think a lot of us, including Ukraine, thought they already had security guarantees from the Budapest Memorandum. So is the U.S. ready to look at the Budapest-plus agreement that expands the number of guarantors?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So this is – in terms of the diplomacy, this is not a question for us regarding what might lead to a ceasefire, a diminution of violence between Ukraine and Russia. This is ultimately a question for our Ukrainian partners to decide – to decide the terms of diplomacy, what they are willing to pursue, what they are not willing to pursue.</p>
<p>This is really at the heart of this conflict, this needless war of aggression that President Putin and his forces are waging. They are waging this war precisely because they sought to deprive Ukraine of its sovereign rights, its sovereign right to determine its own foreign policy, its sovereign right to determine its own Western orientation, its sovereign right to choose its own partners and alliances.</p>
<p>So as part and parcel of that, it is not for us to say the terms by which Ukraine and Russia may be in a position to reach an agreement that we all hope could diminish the violence. That is for Ukraine to decide. We will be standing by our Ukrainian partners, assisting them with the diplomacy as we know a number of our allies and partners around the world are doing. But these are questions for the sovereign state of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-Russia"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. Just a follow-up on this question. More generally, is it good idea, is it wise idea, to sign something under the Russian shelling? And yes or no, if it end up signing some kind of agreement, could one expect that United States will be a part of this agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I missed the first part of your question. It is a &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is it generally good idea, wise idea to sign a peace agreement during the shelling?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we continue to believe that there must be a diplomatic resolution to this war, and that is why we are standing with our Ukrainian partners as they continue to engage in diplomacy, why we’ve been consulting and coordinating so closely with our French allies, our German allies, our Turkish allies, our Israeli partners, and others who have been involved in various diplomatic efforts to try and bring this brutal war to a close.</p>
<p>But we know something else to be true, and that is that diplomacy will have the best chance of success not in the context of escalation but in the context of de-escalation. And to your point, we – and to what I said earlier – have not yet seen any indication that President Putin is willing to de-escalate. In fact, we have seen escalation after escalation. As the Secretary said yesterday, President Putin has continued to put his foot on the accelerator. It is time to put the brakes on this conflict. It is time to see a diminution of the violence. It is time to see de-escalation. It is time to see the Russians take steps that spare additional lives.</p>
<p>Let me go around.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Getting away from the specifics for a minute, I have slightly more of a philosophical question.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-NATO2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You and others in the administration have repeatedly spoken about how united you and your NATO Allies are. And my question is whether you think this is a permanent resolution of the differences and frictions that came up with NATO and the United States over the last four years or if this is sort of a unique convergence of events and there are still – will still be a lot more work to do in terms of the U.S. working with NATO.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I would make the point that any disagreements or disharmony between the United States and NATO came to a close in January of last year, long before this conflict. Secretary Blinken’s first travel to the European continent, you probably recall, was to Brussels. He went to a NATO ministerial. If I recall, his second travel to the continent of Europe was to Brussels, where he attended a NATO ministerial just a few weeks later.</p>
<p>So we have demonstrated from the very first hours of this administration, when Secretary Blinken spoke to the NATO secretary general – and of course, the President has had conversations as well – the indispensability of the NATO Alliance and the fact that to us NATO’s Article 5, the principle that an attack on one is an attack on all, is as sacrosanct today as it was 70-plus years ago when the NATO charter was signed.</p>
<p>Now, I think it is true that the Alliance, in the buildup and in the wake of Russia’s aggression, is as united, as focused, and as purposeful as it has been since the end of the Cold War. It has really brought into focus the reason for being of the Alliance in the first place. I also think – and you can – I’ll let countries speak for themselves, but this brings up once again the point that President Putin, through his actions, has in fact precipitated everything that he has sought to prevent. And a number of countries that just a few short months ago probably would have demurred if asked about any NATO aspirations have given different answers. Of course, I think that the value of NATO, its purpose, its reason for being today is as in focus as it ever has been.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-Russia2"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I know it’s not your department per se, but – so today’s call between Jake Sullivan and General Patrushev, is this not a – because this is the first – correct me if I’m wrong, but this is the first high-level contact since the beginning of the invasion. So is this not a positive signal or – that the sides are coming together? Or how are we supposed to interpret that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I wouldn’t quite characterize it in quite those terms. I will speak – I won’t speak for the White House; they will speak to their own engagements. What I can say is that the last time Secretary Blinken had been in contact with his counterpart was in the immediate aftermath of the potential meeting in Geneva coming down. And this was, of course, right in the midst of the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And I say that I might characterize this contact a bit differently because, as the White House laid out, the National Security Advisor outlined in very clear terms for his counterpart our commitment to continuing to impose costs on the Russian Federation, our commitment to continuing to support the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of our Ukrainian partners.</p>
<p>He also took advantage of the conversation to make very clear that there would be significant consequences and implications were the Russian Federation to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine. So I think this speaks to the fact that there are some very weighty, very consequential issues that are now on the table. There are some very weighty concerns that we have. And so we are going to – we are not going to pass up an opportunity to convey those concerns and to convey the potential implications if we think that direct contact is in our interest.</p>
<p>Paul.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-Iran"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Can I go to Iran?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So where are we? The Iranians say there’s two issues left, which presumably are that they want guarantees from the U.S. and they – against another policy change, and they want the IRGC to be cleared of being named a terrorist group. Can those issues be bridged, and do you expect them to be bridged soon? And secondly, can you – what do you think of the – Britain’s ability to get back its hostages and the coincidental timing of them releasing Iranian funds?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So to your first question, we do think the remaining issues can be bridged. We do think, and we – as we said before, we have made significant progress, we are close to a possible deal, but we’re not there yet. From our end, we are not going to characterize the number or the nature of these remaining issues precisely because we are at a very delicate stage.</p>
<p>We want to do everything we can to see to it that a mutual – well, to determine if a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA is in the offing, and it would need to be in the offing in the short term. As we’ve said, there is little time remaining, given the nuclear advancements that Tehran has made, that over time would obviate the non-proliferation benefits that the JCPOA conveyed. So this is an issue that needs to be worked urgently. It is an issue that has had our urgent attention for some time now. We still continue to believe that a mutual return to compliance would be manifestly in our interests, and we are going to find out in the near term whether we’re able to get there.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-IranUK"></a> When it comes to the news you referred to today, let me just say that we welcome the news regarding British citizens Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori. We, of course, would refer you to our British counterparts for specific questions on their status. When it comes to our efforts, we continue to work night and day to secure the release of our wrongfully detained citizens, and that includes U.S.-UK citizen Morad Tahbaz.</p>
<p>Simply put, Iran is unjustly detaining innocent Americans and others, and Tehran should release them immediately. Securing their release is an utmost priority for this administration. We call upon Iran to make urgent progress toward the release of wrongfully detained U.S. citizens. I can tell you that Special Envoy Malley and Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Carstens, they have been regularly speaking with the families of our detainees. They’ll continue to do so, particularly to pass along the status of any progress to bring their loved ones home. In fact, they spoke with the families of all four wrongfully detained U.S. citizens just yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Does the British release of funds to Iran make it more difficult for you to obtain the release of Americans without doing the same kind of gesture?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, this was a sovereign UK decision. We were not a party to this decision. It doesn’t change the fact that we are going to continue working night and day to do everything we can to bring our citizens home.</p>
<p>Yes, Rich.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks, Ned. Also, this is my first time in the briefing this week, and I want to thank you for your thoughtful words yesterday; for the support of the State Department for our colleagues, for Ben, Pierre, and Sasha; and all the support that you’ve given us. And I know it means a lot to the bullpen, it means a lot to Fox, and it means a lot to me. So thank you for that.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Rich, it’s why we’re here; to help citizens, help those in need. So we’ve – we welcome the good news; we hope to hear more of it.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-Iran2"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Great, thank you. Moving on to an Iran question, there’s a report in Axios that the administration is considering removing the IRGC from the FTO list in return for a public commitment from Iran to de-escalate in the region. Is that something that you can confirm?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>It’s not something I can speak to. It’s not something I can speak to beyond the fact that there are two key issues at the heart of these negotiations. On the one hand, you have the nuclear commitments that Tehran would need to adhere to were it to resume full compliance with the JCPOA. On the other side of the ledger, you have the sanctions relief that the United States, working with our P5+1 partners, would be prepared to provide if we were to achieve a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA. So the issue of sanctions relief is really and has been at the heart of these negotiations, but we’re just not going to speak to specifics at this stage.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Does the IRGC’s missile launches near an American consulate change that calculation? And with that in mind, does the administration still think it would be appropriate for that to even be considered?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>What it underscores for us is the fact that Iran poses a threat to our allies, to our partners, in some cases to the United States, across a range of realms. The most urgent challenge we would face is a nuclear-armed Iran or an Iran that was on the very precipice of obtaining a nuclear weapon. Every challenge that we face and would face from Iran – whether that is its support for proxies, its support for terrorist groups, its ballistic missile program – all of those challenges would become all the more difficult to confront if Iran were in the possession of a nuclear weapon. Iran would be able to act with far greater impunity if it were in possession of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>So we are determined to continue to confront all of those threats working in tandem with our allies and partners, just as we are determined to take that central potential threat off the table – the threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon. That is what we are seeking to do by testing the proposition that, through a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA, we can reimpose the permanent, verifiable limits on Iran’s nuclear program to see to it that Iran is never able to acquire a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is the administration committed, if there is an agreement, to submitting an agreement to congressional review and waiting out the 30-day period before lifting any sanctions?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what I can say at this point, Rich, we obviously don’t have an agreement of any sort, but we will carefully consider the facts and circumstances of any U.S. return to the JCPOA to determine the legal implications, including those under INARA. We’re committed to ensuring the requirements of INARA are fully satisfied.</p>
<p>The President believes that a bipartisan approach across our foreign policy – and we’ve been heartened to see this on a number of issues recently, including on Ukraine, with a $13.6 billion in appropriations, a large chunk of which we spoke to today – but we believe that a bipartisan approach to our foreign policy, including to Iran, is the strongest way to safeguard U.S. interests in the long term. And we have reached out at all levels to members of Congress and their staffs to discuss our approach to Iran. This very week, there have continued to be briefings on the Hill. Special Envoy Malley, Brett McGurk at the White House, others are deeply committed to this continued close engagement with Congress in a bipartisan manner during the negotiations and for whatever comes next.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But that sounds as though you’re not committing to INARA review.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It should sound as though we are committed to ensuring the requirements of INARA are fully satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But that doesn’t mean that you’re submitting it – I mean, that’s not a pledge to submit it to that – through that review process.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, as I said before, we don’t have a deal.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> This is a hypothetical, but if and when there is any sort of agreement, we are committed to ensuring the requirements of INARA are fully satisfied.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-RussiaIran"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yesterday, you were a bit circumspect about Foreign Minister Lavrov’s comments with the Iranian foreign minister at their meeting in Moscow in which he said – you talked – he suggested – his comments appeared to suggest at least that the last-minute Russian objections or their concerns about Ukraine sanctions essentially bleeding over into the JCPOA, that those were resolved. You said that you didn’t think there was really ever an issue in the first place, but have you gotten any more clarity from – not directly from the Russians, presumably, but through anyone else that it is – this issue is, in fact, now resolved and the Russians won’t blow a deal up?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what I will say is that we have spoken to a very small number of outstanding issues in addition to – call it what you will – I think Mr. Borrell called it external factors.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So there have been external factors in addition to outstanding issues. Even if these external factors are fully resolved, and without speaking to them in detail, we’ve seen the comments from senior Russian officials that would seem to suggest that they are in a different place, have been in a different place over the past couple days, than they might have been a few days before that. Even if external factors are removed, we still have some ways to go until and unless we’re able to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Understood, but as far as – your understanding is that those external factors are now reduced or no longer there?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> These external factors were not about us in the first place, so it would not be our place to comment on whether they’re resolved or not.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-Department"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And then I think I can probably guess your answer to this question, but I just want to know, today is the day that you’re supposed to – that the Secretary is supposed to make a determination as to whether to continue the protection for former Secretary Pompeo and Special Envoy Hook. Has he done that? And if he has, what did he decide?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, Matt, we don’t discuss the specifics of protective operations. As you know, Congress has approved authorities that allow the Department of State to protect former or retired senior department officials if the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, determines that the official faces a credible threat from a foreign power or the agent of a foreign power arising specifically from duties that that former official pursued while employed by the Department of State.</p>
<p>And so under Section 7071 of the Appropriations Act, again, the Secretary, in consultation with the DNI, determines and then reports to congressional leadership and the appropriate congressional committees if a former or a retired senior State Department official would receive protection. We have up to $30 million in appropriated funds to be made available if such a determination is made, but I think you can understand why we wouldn’t speak publicly to whether we have made such a determination, as that would potentially pose a security issue.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, not only would it potentially pose a security issue, but it would also be problematic if you were to lift a FTO designation against the IRGC when they’re – if you determine that the threats that they have made to those two men continue to exist.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> You heard from the National Security Advisor. It’s a statement he issued I believe on January 9th, where he made crystal clear that any effort to harm a U.S. citizen, be it on U.S. soil, anywhere in the world, whether that person was a former official, current official of any party, it is something we would take extraordinarily seriously. There is nothing we take with more gravity than the protection, the safety of U.S. citizens. So I will leave it at that.</p>
<p>Yes, Simon.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-ChinaRussia"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I want to kind of come back to Ukraine, but specifically the meeting that the National Security Advisor held with his Chinese counterpart in Rome. Assistant Secretary Kritenbrink you said was there; he’s now returned to Washington, I believe, and I guess had time to debrief you on that or debrief the Department on that. Is there anything more you can tell us about – we understand the message that was given in that meeting, that there are these concerns about China supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine. But at the conclusion of the meeting or coming out of that meeting, what’s your reading on what China’s view is going forward on supporting Russia in Ukraine and whether they’re giving material support?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So it’s not for us to characterize what the PRC view on this or any other issue may be or is. It is for us to characterize the messages that were conveyed very clearly in the course of our diplomacy. And as I indicated two days ago now, one of the reasons – probably the most important reason – we convene at high levels with our PRC counterparts is to ensure that those lines of communication remain open. This is probably the most consequential bilateral relationship on the face of the Earth. It is incumbent upon us as a responsible country to see to it that the competition that characterizes our relationship doesn’t veer into the realm of conflict. And, of course, dialogue and discussion is part of that.</p>
<p>When it comes to the PRC’s approach to Russia and Ukraine, a number of countries – the vast majority of the world’s countries – have stood up with and for our Ukrainian partners. They have stood up against President Putin’s aggression against Ukraine. We have yet to see those – that sort of unambiguous statement from the PRC or that sort of unambiguous support from the PRC, and we’ve made very clear to the PRC that we have significant concerns, and that any effort to compensate Russia for its financial losses, for the economic toll, or, of course, any effort to supply, to provide materiel for Russia’s war effort – that would be met with significant costs not only from the United States but from our allies and partners around the world.</p>
<p>Those are the messages that were conveyed. It is not up to us to characterize any sort of PRC response.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right. You said you’ve yet to see an unambiguous statement from the Chinese. Have you seen any signal or any indication since that meeting from the Chinese of what their position might – is there any change to their position?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I will leave it to our PRC counterparts to speak to their position.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I want to turn to Venezuela.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-Venezuela"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> After the trip to Caracas of a senior U.S. delegation to meet with government – with the government of President Nicolás Maduro, is the U.S. still recognizing Juan Guaidó as the interim president? Are you planning follow-up meetings with Maduro? And are you concerned that these kind of meetings weaken the Venezuelan opposition?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, as we talked about a couple days ago, the visit to Venezuela focused on really two things, and that was securing the release of wrongful detainees and urging the Maduro regime to return to the negotiating table in Mexico with the democratic opposition’s unitary platform to restore democracy in Venezuela. So far from undermining Juan Guaidó, it actually reinforced our support for Interim President Juan Guaidó and his call for a negotiated solution through the Mexico process. There, of course, has been no change in our recognition of Interim President Juan Guaidó’s role. We will continue to work with him as such. We will continue to urge the resumption of negotiations through the Mexico City process.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But does it mean a recognition that who’s in power is, like, Nicolás Maduro and not Juan Guaidó? Because the delegation didn’t go to the house of Juan Guaidó, it went to meet Maduro officials.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> In one way, it was a recognition that it was the Maduro regime that was and continues to hold Americans unjustly against their will. It, of course, was not Juan Guaidó or the unitary platform that held and continues to hold, unjustly, American detainees. So if we seek the return of Americans who are held unjustly against their will, in that case we met with the party that was holding them.</p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-UkraineRussia"></a><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> One element at the top, and then I look forward to your questions.</p>
<p>As the President said today, America stands with the forces of freedom in Ukraine.</p>
<p>To that end, we are leading the effort to isolate President Putin on the global stage while also simultaneously strengthening Ukraine’s hand at the negotiating table. What’s at stake here are the principles of freedom, the right to determine one’s own future. A right that Ukrainians have shown the world they will fight to preserve.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the United States has sent $300 million in humanitarian aid – tens of thousands of tons of food and medicine for displaced families fleeing Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war. U.S. humanitarian aid personnel are on the ground in the region assessing needs in real time.</p>
<p>And just as President Biden pledged we would, we have also surged security assistance to our Ukrainian partners so that they can defend themselves.</p>
<p>As Russia began its military buildup last year, the United States delivered $650 million in military equipment to Ukraine, building on a growing security cooperation relationship dating back to 2014.</p>
<p>As the conflict started, we sped 350 million more in equipment to help bolster Ukraine’s defenses.</p>
<p>Now, this week we are authorizing $1 billion more of arms and equipment, including types already used successfully by Ukraine’s security forces to defend their country against Russian aggression.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement nearly doubles total security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the administration to more than $2 billion, enabling us to surge additional needed assistance, including anti-aircraft, anti-tank, anti-armor systems as well as small arms and munitions used by Ukrainian security forces on the ground right now in their fight to defend their country.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-_Hlk98341488"></a> Among the items included in this new package are 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems; 2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems; 100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems; 100 grenade launchers, 500 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, and 400 shotguns; in addition to over 200 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds; and more.<sup><a id="post-325172-endnote-ref-1" href="#post-325172-endnote-1"></a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the U.S.-produced short-range air defense systems the Ukrainians have been using to great effect, the United States has also identified and is helping the Ukrainians acquire from our partners and allies additional, longer-range systems on which Ukraine’s forces are already trained, as well as additional munitions for those systems.</p>
<p>The United States continues to expedite the authorization and facilitation of additional assistance to Ukraine from our allies. At least 30 countries have provided security assistance to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. In 2022, this year, the Department of State has authorized third-party transfers of defensive equipment from more than 14 countries, a number that continues to grow as allies and partners increase their support to Ukraine.</p>
<p>As the President said, this could be a long and difficult battle, but America will be steadfast. America will continue to answer the call. The United States, our allies and partners, we are united in supporting Ukraine in its time of need.</p>
<p>With that, happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks, Ned. I actually – I have some Iran questions, but I guess we’ll start with Ukraine because I think that’s probably on the top of everyone’s mind. When you speak about additional long-range systems that you – longer-range systems that the Ukrainians are already trained in, you’re talking about the S-300s, or are you talking about – is it broader than just that? And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, so, Matt, what we are doing and what I referred to now is the fact that we are continuing to pursue solutions to help our Ukrainian partners acquire long-range anti-aircraft systems and the munitions they would need for those systems, and the President also alluded to this in his remarks today. I can’t get into the full specifics of this, but we are continuing to work with our allies, with our partners to surge new assistance, and that includes Soviet or Russian-origin anti-aircraft systems and the necessary ammunition to employ them every day to Ukraine. Those are the systems on which they’re already using, the systems on which they are already trained and have actually demonstrated great effect already.</p>
<p>We have said that we welcome assistance from countries around the world. As I mentioned a moment ago, more than 30 countries across the globe have provided defensive security assistance to Ukraine. The United States has – the Department of State, I should say, has authorized the provision of U.S.-origin equipment from at least 14 countries, but we know that &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right, but &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> &#8212; many more are standing up.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But this isn’t U.S.-origin?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> That’s correct. That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So without getting into the actual nitty-gritty specifics of what systems they are and what countries, although it would be nice to know what countries you’re in discussions with about this, what does the U.S., if anything, have to do to facilitate the transfer of such systems? And secondly, can you – I mean, are you close to reaching an agreement with any of the potential donor countries?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> What do we have to do to facilitate the transfer of non-U.S.-origin equipment?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, yeah, legally – correct.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So first, for U.S.-origin equipment, of course there are waivers that are necessary given ITAR provisions and other applicable provisions. The Secretary has repeatedly, with more than 14 countries, authorized the provision of such U.S.-origin equipment to our Ukrainian partners, and we’ve done so on an extremely expedited basis, turning those around in the course of a day.</p>
<p>When it comes to working with countries that may have Russian-made, Soviet-origin equipment, obviously that is not equipment for which we would need to provide any sort of waiver or any sort of formal paperwork. What we are doing, however, is sharing our assessment of the security needs that our Ukrainian partners have – precisely the needs they have, the threat they are under, the types of fires and munitions that they are enduring from President Putin’s forces, and working with them to determine what they may have in their inventories, to marry that with what we have in our inventories, with our knowledge, with their knowledge of what the Ukrainians already have, the training they already have, to determine the most effective package that will allow them to defend themselves.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, are you – can you say if you’re close to an agreement with any – or is it &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> We are having these discussions every day. Thirty countries around the world have already provided security assistance to Ukraine, and we’re having these discussions daily.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, and then the last one is just that – and if a deal is struck, and I realize it’s a hypothetical, so you probably won’t answer, but let me try anyway – if you do get a country X or country Y, or both X and Y, to provide Ukraine with these systems, is – are you – is the U.S. prepared to make up for those? Because I mean presumably if country X and Y give those systems to Ukraine, the Russians most likely aren’t going to want to sell them replacements, right?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I will &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> So is the U.S. going to be, or any ally – are you in discussions to replace those systems that countries might give up?</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-NATOUkraine"></a><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I always appreciate when you answer the question for me. I will note that that is a hypothetical. I will also note, however, that we have continued to provide forms of reassurance to our allies, including our allies on the eastern flank. The Department of Defense recently spoke of the two Patriot missile batteries that had been moved into Poland. We know that countries that are valiantly standing up, that are providing defensive weaponry from their own stocks, they too have their own security needs. When it comes to the NATO Alliance, certainly we will continue to stand by our NATO Allies to make certain that NATO has the power, the capability to defend itself.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Just a quick one. I have a – there are – I think there are drones in the package of new equipment. I wonder if you can confirm that there are these Switchblade drones are part of that, and any details you can give.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I’ve seen quite a bit of reporting over the last 24 hours on that particular system. I think I understand why, when you see the video of it. Look, I can’t confirm particular systems. The President did speak of, or we did speak of tactical unmanned aerial systems. We provided and are providing a hundred of those systems. The system that you referred to would be an anti-armor system. It is certainly consistent with the type of defensive weaponry that we’re providing. But I’m just not in a position to speak to all the specific systems that may be included in that package.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay, then can we move onto the negotiations, discussions going on between the Ukrainians and the Russians?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-UkraineRussia2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> There are some signs, some noises coming from both sides that there might be some movement on that. I wondered if you had a view on the potential for an agreement there, and there’s a discussion about an agreement that would see Ukraine kind of pledge neutrality, not join NATO, like a Sweden or Austria kind of neutrality, and then also have security guarantees from other countries. Could the U.S. be a guarantor of some kind of an agreement like that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we welcome the sentiments expressed that there is hope, that there is optimism for diplomatic progress. But what Ukraine needs now more than sentiments, more than hope, more than optimism, is de-escalation, is an end to the violence, is a tangible indication that President Putin is changing course. And that is something we have not yet seen. And just as I was coming down here, there are more horrifying reports of shelling, of destruction of what appear to be civilian sites across Ukraine, including in Mariupol.</p>
<p>We’ve made clear that we unequivocally support Ukraine’s efforts to achieve peace, to bring an end to the mounting human suffering from President Putin’s war of choice. Diplomacy is always going to be at the center of these efforts. But we remain clear-eyed, as do our Ukrainian partners, as you heard from President Zelenskyy, as you’ve heard from the foreign minister, as you’ve heard from others. It remains our position that Russia needs to halt its campaign of death, of destruction immediately. And we are working simultaneously to do all we can to give Ukraine the strongest hand it can have at the negotiating table, and we’re doing that in a couple different ways.</p>
<p>We’ve already spoken to one of those ways at the top of this briefing when we detailed some of the security assistance that we’re providing to Ukraine, $2 billion over the past year, $1 billion in the past week alone. That is certainly an important element of that. The other part of that effort to strengthen Ukraine’s hand at the negotiating table is what the United States and our allies and partners have brought to bear on the Kremlin, on the Russian Federation, including its economy and its financial system.</p>
<p>We have placed unprecedented pressure on the Russian economy, on its financial system, and every day you see very tangible metrics of that. The stock market remains closed, will remain closed for at least the remainder of this week and potentially even longer, presumably in an effort to prevent capital flight. The ruble is virtually worthless; it is literally worth less than a penny. Russia is on the verge of default; its credit rating is at junk status. Hundreds of international companies are fleeing the Russian market. And we can go on and on.</p>
<p>Now, all of that is part and parcel of our effort to strengthen that Ukrainian position. So we see Ukraine day by day will have a stronger hand as these measures have even more effect on the Russian economy, on the Russian financial system, and as we, together with our allies and partners here, too, continue to provide Ukraine with the defensive security assistance that our Ukrainian partners need to defend themselves inside their own territory.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I just wanted to dig on that a little further, Ned, because certain export controls exist on some of these systems that the two gentlemen mentioned. So is the State Department going to take the lead in talking to allies and easing those export controls, or maybe changing them altogether? And especially given Ukraine’s desperate need, how can you work through those obstacles to maybe get them the aid that they need faster, especially with the export &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I think we have proven throughout the course of this conflict, and even before it, that we are not going to let any sort of technical barrier stand in our way. And I’ve already spoken to the expedited procedures that we have used to approve the provision of U.S.-origin equipment to Ukraine. We have done that in many cases with less than 24 hours notice. The fact that – it was just a couple weeks ago that we announced an additional $350 million in security assistance to Ukraine; within four or five days, more than 70 percent of that vast sum had already been delivered.</p>
<p>So I think that speaks to the fact that we are breaking through not only what might be otherwise burdensome bureaucratic processes and hoops, but we are doing so with alacrity here in this department. Our colleagues at the Department of Defense are doing the same. We know that our allies and partners around the world are doing the same on their end precisely because we recognize the urgency with which our Ukrainian partners need these defensive supplies.</p>
<p>So if there are procedures that we need to go through here at the Department or elsewhere within the government to see to it that appropriate and effective systems are provided to our Ukrainian partners, whether that is from our stocks, whether that is U.S.-origin materiel from the stocks of our allies and partners, or materiel that is non-U.S.-origin, that may even be Russian-made or Soviet origin, we will see to that.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-NATO"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes. So Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister Kaczyński, Jarosław Kaczyński, was in Kyiv yesterday along with leaders of Poland and Czechia and Slovenia. And he called for a peacekeeping mission to Ukraine with the involvement of NATO troops. So is that something that the U.S. would be willing to entertain?</p>
<p>And somewhat relatedly, President Zelenskyy yesterday said that he would like to see more leaders coming to visit him. Are there any chances of U.S. officials doing that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So on your first question, of course, it’s not up to us to speak for NATO. What I can say is essentially what we have heard from the NATO secretary general, is that the Alliance of course is squarely focused on putting an end to this war, bringing this brutal aggression to a close. Just as NATO is, we are intently focused on doing the same. In the same vein, we want to avoid doing anything that would prolong this war or that would expand this war. And having American service members on Ukrainian territory, American pilots in Ukrainian airspace, NATO service members on Ukrainian soil, NATO pilots in Ukrainian airspace – of course that has the potential not to bring this war to a close but to expand it to something that is even larger and much more grave in terms of its implications.</p>
<p>In terms of U.S. officials visiting Ukraine, you’ll know that it was just last week that Secretary Blinken met with his foreign minister counterpart, Foreign Minister Kuleba, on the Polish-Ukrainian border. They actually conducted part of that meeting on sovereign Ukrainian soil, the very sovereign – very sovereignty that Ukrainians are so valiantly and bravely and courageously standing up to defend.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right, but that – it’s a little bit different than going to Kyiv and meeting with Zelenskyy. Stepping across the – I mean, not that it wasn’t a symbolic show of support or anything, but there are no plans to do similar to what the three European &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> The White House has announced plans for the President to go to Brussels. That is the only presidential travel I’m aware of at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Oh, yeah. I’m talking about – okay. Well, but I’m talking about lower than the President. I mean, and just to follow up on Simon’s question earlier about this idea of neutrality and security guarantees, is this something – I realize that you said that what Ukraine needs right now – what they need immediately is de-escalation and a sign that Putin has changed his – changing course. But in the more medium term, is this something that you guys are willing to consider? Because, frankly, I think a lot of us, including Ukraine, thought they already had security guarantees from the Budapest Memorandum. So is the U.S. ready to look at the Budapest-plus agreement that expands the number of guarantors?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So this is – in terms of the diplomacy, this is not a question for us regarding what might lead to a ceasefire, a diminution of violence between Ukraine and Russia. This is ultimately a question for our Ukrainian partners to decide – to decide the terms of diplomacy, what they are willing to pursue, what they are not willing to pursue.</p>
<p>This is really at the heart of this conflict, this needless war of aggression that President Putin and his forces are waging. They are waging this war precisely because they sought to deprive Ukraine of its sovereign rights, its sovereign right to determine its own foreign policy, its sovereign right to determine its own Western orientation, its sovereign right to choose its own partners and alliances.</p>
<p>So as part and parcel of that, it is not for us to say the terms by which Ukraine and Russia may be in a position to reach an agreement that we all hope could diminish the violence. That is for Ukraine to decide. We will be standing by our Ukrainian partners, assisting them with the diplomacy as we know a number of our allies and partners around the world are doing. But these are questions for the sovereign state of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-Russia"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. Just a follow-up on this question. More generally, is it good idea, is it wise idea, to sign something under the Russian shelling? And yes or no, if it end up signing some kind of agreement, could one expect that United States will be a part of this agreement?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I missed the first part of your question. It is a &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is it generally good idea, wise idea to sign a peace agreement during the shelling?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, we continue to believe that there must be a diplomatic resolution to this war, and that is why we are standing with our Ukrainian partners as they continue to engage in diplomacy, why we’ve been consulting and coordinating so closely with our French allies, our German allies, our Turkish allies, our Israeli partners, and others who have been involved in various diplomatic efforts to try and bring this brutal war to a close.</p>
<p>But we know something else to be true, and that is that diplomacy will have the best chance of success not in the context of escalation but in the context of de-escalation. And to your point, we – and to what I said earlier – have not yet seen any indication that President Putin is willing to de-escalate. In fact, we have seen escalation after escalation. As the Secretary said yesterday, President Putin has continued to put his foot on the accelerator. It is time to put the brakes on this conflict. It is time to see a diminution of the violence. It is time to see de-escalation. It is time to see the Russians take steps that spare additional lives.</p>
<p>Let me go around.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. Getting away from the specifics for a minute, I have slightly more of a philosophical question.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-NATO2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> You and others in the administration have repeatedly spoken about how united you and your NATO Allies are. And my question is whether you think this is a permanent resolution of the differences and frictions that came up with NATO and the United States over the last four years or if this is sort of a unique convergence of events and there are still – will still be a lot more work to do in terms of the U.S. working with NATO.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, I would make the point that any disagreements or disharmony between the United States and NATO came to a close in January of last year, long before this conflict. Secretary Blinken’s first travel to the European continent, you probably recall, was to Brussels. He went to a NATO ministerial. If I recall, his second travel to the continent of Europe was to Brussels, where he attended a NATO ministerial just a few weeks later.</p>
<p>So we have demonstrated from the very first hours of this administration, when Secretary Blinken spoke to the NATO secretary general – and of course, the President has had conversations as well – the indispensability of the NATO Alliance and the fact that to us NATO’s Article 5, the principle that an attack on one is an attack on all, is as sacrosanct today as it was 70-plus years ago when the NATO charter was signed.</p>
<p>Now, I think it is true that the Alliance, in the buildup and in the wake of Russia’s aggression, is as united, as focused, and as purposeful as it has been since the end of the Cold War. It has really brought into focus the reason for being of the Alliance in the first place. I also think – and you can – I’ll let countries speak for themselves, but this brings up once again the point that President Putin, through his actions, has in fact precipitated everything that he has sought to prevent. And a number of countries that just a few short months ago probably would have demurred if asked about any NATO aspirations have given different answers. Of course, I think that the value of NATO, its purpose, its reason for being today is as in focus as it ever has been.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-Russia2"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>I know it’s not your department per se, but – so today’s call between Jake Sullivan and General Patrushev, is this not a – because this is the first – correct me if I’m wrong, but this is the first high-level contact since the beginning of the invasion. So is this not a positive signal or – that the sides are coming together? Or how are we supposed to interpret that?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>I wouldn’t quite characterize it in quite those terms. I will speak – I won’t speak for the White House; they will speak to their own engagements. What I can say is that the last time Secretary Blinken had been in contact with his counterpart was in the immediate aftermath of the potential meeting in Geneva coming down. And this was, of course, right in the midst of the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And I say that I might characterize this contact a bit differently because, as the White House laid out, the National Security Advisor outlined in very clear terms for his counterpart our commitment to continuing to impose costs on the Russian Federation, our commitment to continuing to support the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of our Ukrainian partners.</p>
<p>He also took advantage of the conversation to make very clear that there would be significant consequences and implications were the Russian Federation to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine. So I think this speaks to the fact that there are some very weighty, very consequential issues that are now on the table. There are some very weighty concerns that we have. And so we are going to – we are not going to pass up an opportunity to convey those concerns and to convey the potential implications if we think that direct contact is in our interest.</p>
<p>Paul.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-Iran"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Can I go to Iran?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>So where are we? The Iranians say there’s two issues left, which presumably are that they want guarantees from the U.S. and they – against another policy change, and they want the IRGC to be cleared of being named a terrorist group. Can those issues be bridged, and do you expect them to be bridged soon? And secondly, can you – what do you think of the – Britain’s ability to get back its hostages and the coincidental timing of them releasing Iranian funds?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>So to your first question, we do think the remaining issues can be bridged. We do think, and we – as we said before, we have made significant progress, we are close to a possible deal, but we’re not there yet. From our end, we are not going to characterize the number or the nature of these remaining issues precisely because we are at a very delicate stage.</p>
<p>We want to do everything we can to see to it that a mutual – well, to determine if a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA is in the offing, and it would need to be in the offing in the short term. As we’ve said, there is little time remaining, given the nuclear advancements that Tehran has made, that over time would obviate the non-proliferation benefits that the JCPOA conveyed. So this is an issue that needs to be worked urgently. It is an issue that has had our urgent attention for some time now. We still continue to believe that a mutual return to compliance would be manifestly in our interests, and we are going to find out in the near term whether we’re able to get there.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-IranUK"></a> When it comes to the news you referred to today, let me just say that we welcome the news regarding British citizens Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori. We, of course, would refer you to our British counterparts for specific questions on their status. When it comes to our efforts, we continue to work night and day to secure the release of our wrongfully detained citizens, and that includes U.S.-UK citizen Morad Tahbaz.</p>
<p>Simply put, Iran is unjustly detaining innocent Americans and others, and Tehran should release them immediately. Securing their release is an utmost priority for this administration. We call upon Iran to make urgent progress toward the release of wrongfully detained U.S. citizens. I can tell you that Special Envoy Malley and Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Carstens, they have been regularly speaking with the families of our detainees. They’ll continue to do so, particularly to pass along the status of any progress to bring their loved ones home. In fact, they spoke with the families of all four wrongfully detained U.S. citizens just yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Does the British release of funds to Iran make it more difficult for you to obtain the release of Americans without doing the same kind of gesture?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Well, this was a sovereign UK decision. We were not a party to this decision. It doesn’t change the fact that we are going to continue working night and day to do everything we can to bring our citizens home.</p>
<p>Yes, Rich.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Thanks, Ned. Also, this is my first time in the briefing this week, and I want to thank you for your thoughtful words yesterday; for the support of the State Department for our colleagues, for Ben, Pierre, and Sasha; and all the support that you’ve given us. And I know it means a lot to the bullpen, it means a lot to Fox, and it means a lot to me. So thank you for that.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>Rich, it’s why we’re here; to help citizens, help those in need. So we’ve – we welcome the good news; we hope to hear more of it.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-Iran2"></a><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Great, thank you. Moving on to an Iran question, there’s a report in Axios that the administration is considering removing the IRGC from the FTO list in return for a public commitment from Iran to de-escalate in the region. Is that something that you can confirm?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>It’s not something I can speak to. It’s not something I can speak to beyond the fact that there are two key issues at the heart of these negotiations. On the one hand, you have the nuclear commitments that Tehran would need to adhere to were it to resume full compliance with the JCPOA. On the other side of the ledger, you have the sanctions relief that the United States, working with our P5+1 partners, would be prepared to provide if we were to achieve a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA. So the issue of sanctions relief is really and has been at the heart of these negotiations, but we’re just not going to speak to specifics at this stage.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION: </strong>Does the IRGC’s missile launches near an American consulate change that calculation? And with that in mind, does the administration still think it would be appropriate for that to even be considered?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE: </strong>What it underscores for us is the fact that Iran poses a threat to our allies, to our partners, in some cases to the United States, across a range of realms. The most urgent challenge we would face is a nuclear-armed Iran or an Iran that was on the very precipice of obtaining a nuclear weapon. Every challenge that we face and would face from Iran – whether that is its support for proxies, its support for terrorist groups, its ballistic missile program – all of those challenges would become all the more difficult to confront if Iran were in the possession of a nuclear weapon. Iran would be able to act with far greater impunity if it were in possession of a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>So we are determined to continue to confront all of those threats working in tandem with our allies and partners, just as we are determined to take that central potential threat off the table – the threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon. That is what we are seeking to do by testing the proposition that, through a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA, we can reimpose the permanent, verifiable limits on Iran’s nuclear program to see to it that Iran is never able to acquire a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Is the administration committed, if there is an agreement, to submitting an agreement to congressional review and waiting out the 30-day period before lifting any sanctions?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what I can say at this point, Rich, we obviously don’t have an agreement of any sort, but we will carefully consider the facts and circumstances of any U.S. return to the JCPOA to determine the legal implications, including those under INARA. We’re committed to ensuring the requirements of INARA are fully satisfied.</p>
<p>The President believes that a bipartisan approach across our foreign policy – and we’ve been heartened to see this on a number of issues recently, including on Ukraine, with a $13.6 billion in appropriations, a large chunk of which we spoke to today – but we believe that a bipartisan approach to our foreign policy, including to Iran, is the strongest way to safeguard U.S. interests in the long term. And we have reached out at all levels to members of Congress and their staffs to discuss our approach to Iran. This very week, there have continued to be briefings on the Hill. Special Envoy Malley, Brett McGurk at the White House, others are deeply committed to this continued close engagement with Congress in a bipartisan manner during the negotiations and for whatever comes next.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But that sounds as though you’re not committing to INARA review.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> It should sound as though we are committed to ensuring the requirements of INARA are fully satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But that doesn’t mean that you’re submitting it – I mean, that’s not a pledge to submit it to that – through that review process.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Matt, as I said before, we don’t have a deal.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes, okay.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> This is a hypothetical, but if and when there is any sort of agreement, we are committed to ensuring the requirements of INARA are fully satisfied.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-RussiaIran"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yesterday, you were a bit circumspect about Foreign Minister Lavrov’s comments with the Iranian foreign minister at their meeting in Moscow in which he said – you talked – he suggested – his comments appeared to suggest at least that the last-minute Russian objections or their concerns about Ukraine sanctions essentially bleeding over into the JCPOA, that those were resolved. You said that you didn’t think there was really ever an issue in the first place, but have you gotten any more clarity from – not directly from the Russians, presumably, but through anyone else that it is – this issue is, in fact, now resolved and the Russians won’t blow a deal up?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, what I will say is that we have spoken to a very small number of outstanding issues in addition to – call it what you will – I think Mr. Borrell called it external factors.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So there have been external factors in addition to outstanding issues. Even if these external factors are fully resolved, and without speaking to them in detail, we’ve seen the comments from senior Russian officials that would seem to suggest that they are in a different place, have been in a different place over the past couple days, than they might have been a few days before that. Even if external factors are removed, we still have some ways to go until and unless we’re able to &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Understood, but as far as – your understanding is that those external factors are now reduced or no longer there?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> These external factors were not about us in the first place, so it would not be our place to comment on whether they’re resolved or not.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-Department"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> And then I think I can probably guess your answer to this question, but I just want to know, today is the day that you’re supposed to – that the Secretary is supposed to make a determination as to whether to continue the protection for former Secretary Pompeo and Special Envoy Hook. Has he done that? And if he has, what did he decide?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, Matt, we don’t discuss the specifics of protective operations. As you know, Congress has approved authorities that allow the Department of State to protect former or retired senior department officials if the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, determines that the official faces a credible threat from a foreign power or the agent of a foreign power arising specifically from duties that that former official pursued while employed by the Department of State.</p>
<p>And so under Section 7071 of the Appropriations Act, again, the Secretary, in consultation with the DNI, determines and then reports to congressional leadership and the appropriate congressional committees if a former or a retired senior State Department official would receive protection. We have up to $30 million in appropriated funds to be made available if such a determination is made, but I think you can understand why we wouldn’t speak publicly to whether we have made such a determination, as that would potentially pose a security issue.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Well, not only would it potentially pose a security issue, but it would also be problematic if you were to lift a FTO designation against the IRGC when they’re – if you determine that the threats that they have made to those two men continue to exist.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> You heard from the National Security Advisor. It’s a statement he issued I believe on January 9th, where he made crystal clear that any effort to harm a U.S. citizen, be it on U.S. soil, anywhere in the world, whether that person was a former official, current official of any party, it is something we would take extraordinarily seriously. There is nothing we take with more gravity than the protection, the safety of U.S. citizens. So I will leave it at that.</p>
<p>Yes, Simon.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-ChinaRussia"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I want to kind of come back to Ukraine, but specifically the meeting that the National Security Advisor held with his Chinese counterpart in Rome. Assistant Secretary Kritenbrink you said was there; he’s now returned to Washington, I believe, and I guess had time to debrief you on that or debrief the Department on that. Is there anything more you can tell us about – we understand the message that was given in that meeting, that there are these concerns about China supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine. But at the conclusion of the meeting or coming out of that meeting, what’s your reading on what China’s view is going forward on supporting Russia in Ukraine and whether they’re giving material support?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> So it’s not for us to characterize what the PRC view on this or any other issue may be or is. It is for us to characterize the messages that were conveyed very clearly in the course of our diplomacy. And as I indicated two days ago now, one of the reasons – probably the most important reason – we convene at high levels with our PRC counterparts is to ensure that those lines of communication remain open. This is probably the most consequential bilateral relationship on the face of the Earth. It is incumbent upon us as a responsible country to see to it that the competition that characterizes our relationship doesn’t veer into the realm of conflict. And, of course, dialogue and discussion is part of that.</p>
<p>When it comes to the PRC’s approach to Russia and Ukraine, a number of countries – the vast majority of the world’s countries – have stood up with and for our Ukrainian partners. They have stood up against President Putin’s aggression against Ukraine. We have yet to see those – that sort of unambiguous statement from the PRC or that sort of unambiguous support from the PRC, and we’ve made very clear to the PRC that we have significant concerns, and that any effort to compensate Russia for its financial losses, for the economic toll, or, of course, any effort to supply, to provide materiel for Russia’s war effort – that would be met with significant costs not only from the United States but from our allies and partners around the world.</p>
<p>Those are the messages that were conveyed. It is not up to us to characterize any sort of PRC response.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Right. You said you’ve yet to see an unambiguous statement from the Chinese. Have you seen any signal or any indication since that meeting from the Chinese of what their position might – is there any change to their position?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> I will leave it to our PRC counterparts to speak to their position.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> I want to turn to Venezuela.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Sure.</p>
<p><a id="post-325172-Venezuela"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> After the trip to Caracas of a senior U.S. delegation to meet with government – with the government of President Nicolás Maduro, is the U.S. still recognizing Juan Guaidó as the interim president? Are you planning follow-up meetings with Maduro? And are you concerned that these kind of meetings weaken the Venezuelan opposition?</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> Well, as we talked about a couple days ago, the visit to Venezuela focused on really two things, and that was securing the release of wrongful detainees and urging the Maduro regime to return to the negotiating table in Mexico with the democratic opposition’s unitary platform to restore democracy in Venezuela. So far from undermining Juan Guaidó, it actually reinforced our support for Interim President Juan Guaidó and his call for a negotiated solution through the Mexico process. There, of course, has been no change in our recognition of Interim President Juan Guaidó’s role. We will continue to work with him as such. We will continue to urge the resumption of negotiations through the Mexico City process.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> But does it mean a recognition that who’s in power is, like, Nicolás Maduro and not Juan Guaidó? Because the delegation didn’t go to the house of Juan Guaidó, it went to meet Maduro officials.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong> In one way, it was a recognition that it was the Maduro regime that was and continues to hold Americans unjustly against their will. It, of course, was not Juan Guaidó or the unitary platform that held and continues to hold, unjustly, American detainees. So if we seek the return of Americans who are held unjustly against their will, in that case we met with the party that was holding them.</p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 3:01 p.m.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b> You said – and I’ll just read this – “we have to be prepared, unfortunately, tragically, for this to go one for some time,” meaning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  I want to explore some of the implications of that.  Do we need to be prepared for the reality of the continued destruction of Ukrainian cities?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Steve, I’m afraid that we do.  We’ve seen the brutality that Vladimir Putin has brought to this.  We know his track record in Chechnya.  We know the track record of what he’s aided and abetted in Syria.  I think we have to expect the same.  And part of the reason we have to expect the same is that this has not gone according to Putin’s plan.  It’s – he anticipated that somehow they would go into Ukraine, the Ukrainians would either somehow welcome them or, at least, fold their tents and move out, and of course, exactly the opposite has happened.  You’ve got more than 40 million Ukrainians who are standing strong in opposition to Putin, to Russia, and who will never be subjugated to Russia.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  But we’re talking about this now going on for some time, watching this ongoing destruction for some time.  How hard is it going to be to watch that destruction and continue saying no to some of the kinds of aid that President Zelenskyy is asking for?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, let’s focus on what we’re saying yes to, because it’s been extraordinary.  The support that we’ve provided, other countries have provided in coordination with us in terms of security assistance – the stuff that is actually working, that is getting into Ukrainian hands, that’s making all the difference in them being able to defend themselves, being able to shoot down Russian planes and take out Russian tanks – that’s been an extraordinary effort, and as I said, it’s ongoing.  We’re about, thanks to Congress, to get another $13.5 billion, a big chunk of which will go to that effort.  We’re coordinating efforts around the world to get this kind of assistance in, and that’s happening, and that’s working.</p>
<p>Second, we’re exerting extraordinary pressure on Putin and Russia itself.  One of the reasons that President Biden is going to Europe next week, going to NATO and meeting with other European leaders, is to sustain that effort, sustain the effort for Ukraine and against Russia.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Are you prepared to send more kinds of armaments, such as longer-range anti-aircraft missiles, like the old Soviet S-300s?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  In short, we’re looking at everything that we believe can be effective, and that’s the main thing.  We want to make sure that what we’re providing, what others are providing can get there, get into Ukrainian hands, and be used effectively.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  You mentioned, Secretary Blinken, the sanctions against Russia.  Of course, if the war goes on for some time, the sanctions go on for some time.  They begin to feel permanent.  How is the world likely to be a different place if Russia is permanently unplugged from the global economy?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, Steve, two things.  First, sanctions in and of themselves are not designed to be permanent.  They’re a tool, and if you get the result that you’re trying to achieve, the sanctions go away.  And so my strong hope would be that this war gets brought to an end, that Putin stops the aggression, and then the sanctions ultimately stop.</p>
<p>But yes, there are certainly changes that we’re seeing and changes that can be profound.  One of the changes is that Europeans are looking really hard – not only looking but starting to act – on energy diversification, on energy security, and weaning themselves off of Russian oil, Russian gas.  That would be a major change.  One of the things we’re doing is denying Russia the technology it needs to modernize its country, to modernize key industries – defense and aerospace, its high-tech sector, energy exploration.  All of these things are going to have profound effects, and again, not just the immediate effects we’re seeing, but increasing and growing over time.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Some of these changes would seem almost irreversible at this point, Mr. Secretary.  Are you still prepared to tell Russia that if the shooting stops, the sanctions can all stop, that everything can go back the way that it was?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>If the war ends, Ukraine’s independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty are restored, then many of the tools that we’re using to get to that result – of course, that’s the purpose of them.  They’re not designed to be permanent.  We will want to make sure, they will want to make sure that anything that’s done is in effect irreversible, that this can’t happen again, that Russia won’t pick up and do exactly what it’s doing in a year or two years or three years.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Are the United States and its European allies capable of isolating China in the way that you’ve isolated Russia if China were to aid Russia beyond some certain point?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Well, China is already on the wrong side of history when it comes to Ukraine and the aggression being committed by Russia.  The fact that it has not stood strongly against it, that it has not pronounced itself against this aggression, flies in the face of China’s commitments as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council responsible for maintaining peace and security.  It’s totally inconsistent with what China says and repeats over and over again about the sanctity of the United Nations Charter and the basic principles, including the sovereignty of nations.  And so we’re looking to China to speak out, to speak up, and to be very clear.</p>
<p>Second, of course, if China actually provides material support in one way or another to Russia in this effort, that would be even worse.  It’s something we’re looking very carefully at.  But I think this is doing real damage to China reputationally in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, and other parts of the world – something it has to pay a lot of attention to.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have an incredibly destructive situation with a country that is being bombed, people being killed, the country destroyed.  I would say too – I’m speaking to you as a journalist – we’re seeing, of course, the horrific toll on Ukrainians, on civilians, mothers, fathers, daughters, women, children.</p>
<p>We’re also seeing journalists in the crossfire, people doing their jobs to bring the truth to the world.  We’ve seen a Fox team that was – had two of its members killed, one injured, someone I know very well.  This is Ben Hall.  He’s someone who travels with me when I travel around the world, someone I have great affection for, who’s a tremendous reporter who asks me a lot of tough questions every place we go.  I’m very much hoping and praying that he’ll be back on the job as soon as possible, but meanwhile two of his colleagues lost their lives in this attack, and another very prominent filmmaker lost his life just the other day.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Do you have reason to think that Russian troops are targeting journalists?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We are looking very hard at the targeting that the Russian forces are doing, including whether they are deliberately, intentionally targeting civilians, journalists, anyone else.  This is something we’re looking hard at, we’re documenting.  Others are looking at this.  The deliberate targeting of civilians, journalists, and others would constitute a war crime.  So it’s something that we’re very focused on.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Of course, there’s an information war going on here, and this too would go on for some time.  The Ukrainians have been very effective in getting their message out.  The United States, it would seem, has been effective in getting its message out.  But let me ask you about another aspect of this.  How, if at all, does the United States intend to counter voices at home who have routinely repeated Russian talking points on TV?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Well, Steve, happily, in my job I don’t do politics.  I certainly don’t do domestic politics.  But what we have seen is this – or at least what I’ve seen is this.  I’ve spent a lot of time talking to members of Congress.  There’s incredibly strong bipartisan support for this effort, the effort to support Ukraine, the effort to punish Russia for what it’s doing and put pressure on it.  I saw that not just in Washington in the halls of Congress, I saw it recently at the Munich Security Conference, where there was a very strong delegation from Congress – bipartisan, both houses.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>You don’t need to worry about the wing of the Republican party that has been openly sympathetic to Putin over the years?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Again, I don’t do politics at home.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Understood.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>I would just hope that, as everyone looks at this – Americans and beyond – the picture is very clear; it couldn’t be more clear.  We have an aggressor; we have a victim.  We have a country in Russia that is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a Security Council that came into being with the main purpose, the main mission of maintaining international peace and security, a country now that has done more than any other to blow up that international peace and security by an unprovoked aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p>That’s what the world should be focused on, because, Steve, it speaks not only to Ukraine and to the suffering of its people – it actually speaks to the entire world, because these basic principles that Russia is violating, that Russia’s aggressing, are the principles necessary to actually keep the peace, keep security, keep international stability.  If we allow them to be violated with impunity, we open a Pandora’s box of conflict, of confrontation, of war that we tried to close after two world wars.  That’s what Russia is threatening right now.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Final thing, Mr. Secretary:  Do you have any channel that is open to Vladimir Putin right now to communicate about any way to end this war?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Well, various leaders, countries have sought to communicate with him, may even remain in communication with him.  Of course, the Ukrainians are talking to the Russians.  We over many months offered President Putin offramps to avoid this aggression in the first place, and even since the aggression has been committed.  Tragically, each and every time, instead of taking an offramp, he’s pressed the accelerator.  So diplomacy ultimately is going to have to be part of the solution to this, but that really depends on Vladimir Putin engaging in meaningful &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>But when I say do you have a channel, I mean the United States.  Does the United States have any channel open to Putin?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Well, there are always ways of communicating.  Let me leave it at that.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Secretary Antony Blinken, thanks so much.  Enjoyed it.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thanks, Steve.  Good to be with you.</p>

<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Steve, I’m afraid that we do.  We’ve seen the brutality that Vladimir Putin has brought to this.  We know his track record in Chechnya.  We know the track record of what he’s aided and abetted in Syria.  I think we have to expect the same.  And part of the reason we have to expect the same is that this has not gone according to Putin’s plan.  It’s – he anticipated that somehow they would go into Ukraine, the Ukrainians would either somehow welcome them or, at least, fold their tents and move out, and of course, exactly the opposite has happened.  You’ve got more than 40 million Ukrainians who are standing strong in opposition to Putin, to Russia, and who will never be subjugated to Russia.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  But we’re talking about this now going on for some time, watching this ongoing destruction for some time.  How hard is it going to be to watch that destruction and continue saying no to some of the kinds of aid that President Zelenskyy is asking for?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, let’s focus on what we’re saying yes to, because it’s been extraordinary.  The support that we’ve provided, other countries have provided in coordination with us in terms of security assistance – the stuff that is actually working, that is getting into Ukrainian hands, that’s making all the difference in them being able to defend themselves, being able to shoot down Russian planes and take out Russian tanks – that’s been an extraordinary effort, and as I said, it’s ongoing.  We’re about, thanks to Congress, to get another $13.5 billion, a big chunk of which will go to that effort.  We’re coordinating efforts around the world to get this kind of assistance in, and that’s happening, and that’s working.</p>
<p>Second, we’re exerting extraordinary pressure on Putin and Russia itself.  One of the reasons that President Biden is going to Europe next week, going to NATO and meeting with other European leaders, is to sustain that effort, sustain the effort for Ukraine and against Russia.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Are you prepared to send more kinds of armaments, such as longer-range anti-aircraft missiles, like the old Soviet S-300s?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  In short, we’re looking at everything that we believe can be effective, and that’s the main thing.  We want to make sure that what we’re providing, what others are providing can get there, get into Ukrainian hands, and be used effectively.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  You mentioned, Secretary Blinken, the sanctions against Russia.  Of course, if the war goes on for some time, the sanctions go on for some time.  They begin to feel permanent.  How is the world likely to be a different place if Russia is permanently unplugged from the global economy?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, Steve, two things.  First, sanctions in and of themselves are not designed to be permanent.  They’re a tool, and if you get the result that you’re trying to achieve, the sanctions go away.  And so my strong hope would be that this war gets brought to an end, that Putin stops the aggression, and then the sanctions ultimately stop.</p>
<p>But yes, there are certainly changes that we’re seeing and changes that can be profound.  One of the changes is that Europeans are looking really hard – not only looking but starting to act – on energy diversification, on energy security, and weaning themselves off of Russian oil, Russian gas.  That would be a major change.  One of the things we’re doing is denying Russia the technology it needs to modernize its country, to modernize key industries – defense and aerospace, its high-tech sector, energy exploration.  All of these things are going to have profound effects, and again, not just the immediate effects we’re seeing, but increasing and growing over time.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Some of these changes would seem almost irreversible at this point, Mr. Secretary.  Are you still prepared to tell Russia that if the shooting stops, the sanctions can all stop, that everything can go back the way that it was?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>If the war ends, Ukraine’s independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty are restored, then many of the tools that we’re using to get to that result – of course, that’s the purpose of them.  They’re not designed to be permanent.  We will want to make sure, they will want to make sure that anything that’s done is in effect irreversible, that this can’t happen again, that Russia won’t pick up and do exactly what it’s doing in a year or two years or three years.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Are the United States and its European allies capable of isolating China in the way that you’ve isolated Russia if China were to aid Russia beyond some certain point?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Well, China is already on the wrong side of history when it comes to Ukraine and the aggression being committed by Russia.  The fact that it has not stood strongly against it, that it has not pronounced itself against this aggression, flies in the face of China’s commitments as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council responsible for maintaining peace and security.  It’s totally inconsistent with what China says and repeats over and over again about the sanctity of the United Nations Charter and the basic principles, including the sovereignty of nations.  And so we’re looking to China to speak out, to speak up, and to be very clear.</p>
<p>Second, of course, if China actually provides material support in one way or another to Russia in this effort, that would be even worse.  It’s something we’re looking very carefully at.  But I think this is doing real damage to China reputationally in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, and other parts of the world – something it has to pay a lot of attention to.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have an incredibly destructive situation with a country that is being bombed, people being killed, the country destroyed.  I would say too – I’m speaking to you as a journalist – we’re seeing, of course, the horrific toll on Ukrainians, on civilians, mothers, fathers, daughters, women, children.</p>
<p>We’re also seeing journalists in the crossfire, people doing their jobs to bring the truth to the world.  We’ve seen a Fox team that was – had two of its members killed, one injured, someone I know very well.  This is Ben Hall.  He’s someone who travels with me when I travel around the world, someone I have great affection for, who’s a tremendous reporter who asks me a lot of tough questions every place we go.  I’m very much hoping and praying that he’ll be back on the job as soon as possible, but meanwhile two of his colleagues lost their lives in this attack, and another very prominent filmmaker lost his life just the other day.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Do you have reason to think that Russian troops are targeting journalists?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We are looking very hard at the targeting that the Russian forces are doing, including whether they are deliberately, intentionally targeting civilians, journalists, anyone else.  This is something we’re looking hard at, we’re documenting.  Others are looking at this.  The deliberate targeting of civilians, journalists, and others would constitute a war crime.  So it’s something that we’re very focused on.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Of course, there’s an information war going on here, and this too would go on for some time.  The Ukrainians have been very effective in getting their message out.  The United States, it would seem, has been effective in getting its message out.  But let me ask you about another aspect of this.  How, if at all, does the United States intend to counter voices at home who have routinely repeated Russian talking points on TV?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Well, Steve, happily, in my job I don’t do politics.  I certainly don’t do domestic politics.  But what we have seen is this – or at least what I’ve seen is this.  I’ve spent a lot of time talking to members of Congress.  There’s incredibly strong bipartisan support for this effort, the effort to support Ukraine, the effort to punish Russia for what it’s doing and put pressure on it.  I saw that not just in Washington in the halls of Congress, I saw it recently at the Munich Security Conference, where there was a very strong delegation from Congress – bipartisan, both houses.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>You don’t need to worry about the wing of the Republican party that has been openly sympathetic to Putin over the years?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Again, I don’t do politics at home.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Understood.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>I would just hope that, as everyone looks at this – Americans and beyond – the picture is very clear; it couldn’t be more clear.  We have an aggressor; we have a victim.  We have a country in Russia that is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a Security Council that came into being with the main purpose, the main mission of maintaining international peace and security, a country now that has done more than any other to blow up that international peace and security by an unprovoked aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p>That’s what the world should be focused on, because, Steve, it speaks not only to Ukraine and to the suffering of its people – it actually speaks to the entire world, because these basic principles that Russia is violating, that Russia’s aggressing, are the principles necessary to actually keep the peace, keep security, keep international stability.  If we allow them to be violated with impunity, we open a Pandora’s box of conflict, of confrontation, of war that we tried to close after two world wars.  That’s what Russia is threatening right now.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Final thing, Mr. Secretary:  Do you have any channel that is open to Vladimir Putin right now to communicate about any way to end this war?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Well, various leaders, countries have sought to communicate with him, may even remain in communication with him.  Of course, the Ukrainians are talking to the Russians.  We over many months offered President Putin offramps to avoid this aggression in the first place, and even since the aggression has been committed.  Tragically, each and every time, instead of taking an offramp, he’s pressed the accelerator.  So diplomacy ultimately is going to have to be part of the solution to this, but that really depends on Vladimir Putin engaging in meaningful &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>But when I say do you have a channel, I mean the United States.  Does the United States have any channel open to Putin?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Well, there are always ways of communicating.  Let me leave it at that.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Secretary Antony Blinken, thanks so much.  Enjoyed it.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thanks, Steve.  Good to be with you.</p>
