					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>Chancellery</p>
<p><strong>CHANCELLOR MERKEL:</strong> (Via interpreter) Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to welcome the foreign secretary, the Secretary of State of the United States Antony Blinken, and that I have the opportunity to get to know him a little bit better in his new position.</p>
<p>Actually, what brings him here is the conference on Libya that has taken place this afternoon, and I’m very grateful for the fact that Tony Blinken has set out on this journey to attend this conference because it is very important that we send out a united signal in the direction of Libya that we want to, first and foremost, see that the people of Libya determine their future, but also to indicate that international partners stand ready to accompany them on their path. Because we’re all aware of the strategic importance that the situation in Libya has with an eye to Africa, but also with an eye to the relationship between Africa and Europe.</p>
<p>We will have the opportunity for a brief exchange of views and we will undoubtedly touch upon the transatlantic agenda, the individual issues there. I had the opportunity of meeting the newly elected American President Joe Biden at the G7 Summit meeting in Cornwall and then afterwards at the NATO Summit meeting in Brussels. I would say that we’ve been able to find a common basis on which to tackle the geostrategic challenges of the world, not only identify them but actually to agree on a common approach towards these problems. This is true with an eye to Russia, with an eye to China, but it is equally true with an eye to the possible alliances we might form that represent our interests, and we will continue that exchange.</p>
<p>There’s also been a bilateral exchange of views between President Biden and the Russian President Mr. Putin, and I strongly welcome the fact that such a meeting has taken place. He has also met with the Chinese leadership – in Alaska, that is. Given all the controversies in the world, I think it is fair to say that we need to keep open channels for dialogue in which we can explain our positions and our approaches and then seek possible corridors towards solving these problems.</p>
<p>Again, thank you very much for coming to pay a visit. We look back on a very long history of good American-German relations and we are delighted that the American states, in order to quote the American President Joe Biden, are back again on the international, multilateral scene. Germany and America are partners in that regard, we are aware of the responsibility we bear, and I look forward to the exchange of views today.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong> Chancellor Merkel, thank you very much. Thank you for receiving me. Thank you for taking the time. But thank you especially for your remarkable leadership. I think it’s fair to say that the United States has no better partner, no better friend in the world than Germany. And it starts with, of course, shared values and shared interests but also, I think something the chancellor has expressed, a shared conviction that of all of the challenges that we face and that have an impact on the lives of our people, we know and we agree that no one country can address them alone.</p>
<p>There is a premium, maybe more than ever before, on cooperation, on coordination, on working with others, and Germany has set the example in doing just that. Whether it’s on COVID-19, climate change, the disruptive impact of new technologies, across the board the things that are really having an impact on the lives of our people, Germany and the United States share a conviction that we have to find ways to work together and work with others. And President Biden has focused these first six months of his presidency on reinvigorating our alliances on a bilateral basis, reinvigorating our engagement in multilateral institutions. And across the board, Germany has been our strong partner.</p>
<p>I think we also agree that we have a responsibility, particularly in this moment, to demonstrate that democracies can deliver – deliver in the lives of our people, deliver for people around the world. And there again, the example that the chancellor has set, that Germany has set could not be stronger, and today is a very good example of that with the work that Germany has done on Libya and the hope of this moment to actually see Libya hopefully take a course of security, freedom, independence, backed by the international community.</p>
<p>There is indeed a lot to talk about from China to Russia to many other issues in between, but for today, Chancellor, let me just simply say again, thank you, and also to tell you again how much President Biden looks forward to seeing you in Washington next month.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>CHANCELLOR MERKEL:</strong> Okay, <em>danke schoen</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“</em><em>We count on Germany as a key Ally, friend and partner.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"> –<em> Secretary Antony J. Blinken, May 24, 2021</em></p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will travel to the Federal Republic of Germany on June 22, 2021, where he will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German Minister of Foreign Affairs Heiko Maas to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to deepening the U.S.-Germany and Transatlantic relationships.  They will discuss recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, addressing the climate crisis, and meeting the challenges posed by China and Russia.  Secretary Blinken will also take part in the Berlin II Conference on peace and stability in Libya.</p>
<p><strong>Working Together to Strengthen European and Global Security</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The United States and Germany enjoy a close relationship and Alliance, built on mutual commitments to democracy, human rights, the rule of law, security and prosperity.  The United States and Germany cooperate through several multilateral institutions including NATO, the G7, the OSCE, and the UN, to advance security, democratic values and the rule of law globally.</li>
<li>The United States and Germany are engaged and dedicated NATO Allies, and American and German servicemembers have proudly served side by side in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Our two countries are committed to close Transatlantic defense cooperation, and joint training and capacity building exercises are regularly performed at U.S. military installations in Germany.</li>
<li>The United States and Germany share concerns about the health of both our citizens and the global community as we seek to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and ensure equitable access to safe and effective vaccines.  Both countries are leaders in funding global vaccination efforts, with the United States announcing funding of $4 billion to COVAX and Germany announcing funding of 1.5 billion euros to COVAX and the WHO.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extensive Economic and Cultural Ties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The United States and Germany share a deep, extensive, and mutually beneficial trade relationship.  Germany is the largest European trading partner of the United States.  In 2020 Germany was the sixth-largest market globally for U.S. exports and the United States’ fifth-largest trading partner in total trade.  Since 2012, the United States and Germany have averaged roughly $170 billion in annual trade in goods, with $172.9 billion in total trade in 2020.  The United States is Germany’s largest export market, and Germany is the third-largest source of foreign direct investment in the United States.</li>
<li>More than 40 million Americans of German heritage live in the United States, comprising the largest ethnic ancestry group of the United States.  Established in 1952, the U.S.-Germany Fulbright program is one of the oldest, largest, and most innovative Fulbright programs in the world, and the binational German-American Fulbright Commission has created initiatives such as diversity programs and an international higher education administrators seminar, which are emulated by other Fulbright commissions in Europe and around the world.  Since 1983, the bilateral Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange program has provided almost 28,000 U.S. and German high school students and young professionals with an academic year exchange experience resulting in thousands of new personal and professional connections between the United States and Germany.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Working Together to Combat Anti-Semitism and Holocaust Denial</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The United States and Germany share a commitment to combatting anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial and distortion and to finding innovative new ways to enhance Holocaust education and commemoration.  We plan to discuss steps we can take together in these areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>United in Combatting the Climate Crisis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The United States and Germany are leaders in the fight against climate change, encouraging other countries to set ambitious climate targets of their own.  The United States is committed to reaching the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as outlined in the Paris Agreement.  We applaud Germany’s ambitious climate goals that they have set for themselves in terms of cutting emissions.  Our two countries are united in our goals of leading the world to develop innovative clean technologies, transforming energy systems across the board, and achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across global economies by 2050 or before.</li>
<li>S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry recently visited Germany to discuss climate policy, where he met with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas in Berlin to discuss the threat of climate change to international security.  The United States looks forward to cooperating with Germany in preparation for the COP26 Conference in Glasgow in November.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States congratulates the people of Armenia on their June 20 parliamentary elections. We welcome the overall positive assessment by the OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission. We are pleased that ODIHR’s preliminary conclusions noted voters’ human rights and fundamental freedoms were generally respected, contestants were able to campaign freely, and that ODIHR assessed election-day vote counting as positive. We share ODIHR’s concern regarding intense polarization and inflammatory rhetoric among key contestants.  We urge Armenians of all political affiliations to respect the results of these elections once certified, employ the legal election grievance process to address issues of concern, and avoid political retaliation as Armenia continues to pursue a sovereign, democratic, peaceful, and prosperous future.</p>
<p>The United States is committed to strengthening our partnership with Armenia based on shared democratic values. We commend Armenia for the progress it has made with respect to reforms and anti-corruption efforts and encourage Armenia to continue along this path, in line with the aspirations of the Armenian people, as expressed in the spring of 2018. We urge all parties to respect the rule of law and democratic principles and look forward to working with the new Government to grow our bilateral relationship and cooperation.</p>
<p>We commend Ambassador Lynne Tracy and U.S. Embassy Staff in Yerevan for their strong, ongoing support for Armenia’s democratic development. Through their dedication and hard work, we will continue to advance the U.S.-Armenia partnership.</p>
