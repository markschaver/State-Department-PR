					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State is offering rewards of up to $5 million each for information leading to the arrests and/or convictions of Honduran drug trafficker Herlinda Bobadilla and her two sons, Tito Montes Bobadilla and Juan Carlos Montes Bobadilla.  Their leadership roles in the Montes drug trafficking organization have grown significantly since the 2017 arrest and 2019 extradition to the United States of Herlinda’s third son, Noe Montes Bobadilla, who is currently serving a 37-year sentence for conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine intended for unlawful importation to the United States.  The Montes drug trafficking organization imports, supplies, transports, and distributes drugs and launders illicit narcotics proceeds through Central America, Mexico, and the United States.</p>
<p>Together, the Department of Justice’s indictment and the Department of State’s reward offers are part of a whole-of-government effort to combat drug trafficking and transnational organized crime globally and in Honduras.  Today’s action supports U.S. government efforts to fight the destabilizing effects of transnational crime in Central America.</p>
<p>This reward is offered under the Department of State’s Narcotics Rewards Program (NRP).  The NRP has helped bring more than 75 transnational criminals and major narcotics traffickers to justice since its inception in 1986.  The Department has paid more than $135 million in rewards for information leading to apprehensions and convictions.</p>
<p>The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs manages the NRP in close coordination with federal law enforcement partners and other U.S. government agencies.  These actions demonstrate the Department’s commitment to supporting law enforcement efforts to bring transnational criminals to justice.</p>
<p>For more information on the individuals listed above and the NRP and TOCRP, please see <a class="external-link" href="https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-international-narcotics-and-law-enforcement-affairs/inl-rewards-program/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-international-narcotics-and-law-enforcement-affairs/inl-rewards-program/</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today, the United States and Armenia signed a Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Strategic Civil Nuclear Cooperation (NCMOU), enabling us to deepen our strategic cooperation following on the gains made in connection with the U.S.-Armenia Strategic Dialogue. This MOU improves our cooperation on energy security and strengthens our diplomatic and economic relationship.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken signed for the United States, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ararat Mirzoyan signed for Armenia.</p>
<p>The United States and Armenia maintain long-standing cooperation across the breadth of our relationship, including in the fields of security, energy, commerce, and nonproliferation.  Deepening our cooperation in civil nuclear energy, science, and technology will strengthen our strategic bilateral relationship, and have wide-ranging, positive impacts on how we work together.</p>
<p>Nuclear Cooperation MOUs are diplomatic mechanisms that strengthen and expand strategic ties between the United States and a partner country by providing a framework for cooperation and a mutually aligned approach to nonproliferation on civil nuclear issues and for engagement between experts from government, industry, national laboratories, and academic institutions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I extend my warmest greetings to Muslims and all those celebrating Eid al-Fitr in the United States and around the globe.</p>
<p>This celebration marks the completion of Ramadan, a month of fasting, reflection, charity, and generosity.  Eid morning begins with families and communities coming together for prayer services at mosques and community centers, followed by festivities and feasts with friends and neighbors.  Cultures worldwide have their own unique and vibrant Eid traditions, as diverse as Muslim communities themselves.  During this time of compassion and giving, we cannot forget those who are unable to celebrate this special holiday from the safety and comfort of their homes or with their communities, due to displacement by war, violence, or persecution.  The United States will continue efforts to pursue truth, justice, and accountability for members of religious minority groups suffering around the world.</p>
<p>Later this month, I look forward to hosting an Eid-al-Fitr reception at the State Department, where I will get the chance to break bread with leaders from across the Muslim community and reflect on the past year and our shared values.</p>
<p>Eid Mubarak to all celebrating this joyous day.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>We strongly condemn the atrocities depicted in a recently released video, which appears to show blindfolded, unarmed civilians being shot point-blank by an Assad regime official before falling into a mass grave in Tadamon, Syria, during a 2013 massacre that reportedly killed hundreds of Syrian civilians. The video, which suggests additional evidence of war crimes committed by the Assad regime, is yet another harrowing example of the horrors that the Syrian people have endured for more than a decade.</p>
<p>The State Department commends and continues to support the brave individuals who work to bring Assad and his regime to justice, often at the risk of their own lives.  This includes the vital work of Syrian civil society organizations to document violations of the law of armed conflict as well as human rights abuses and violations and their efforts to advance transitional justice.  The United States government remains firmly committed to securing accountability for the atrocities the Assad regime continues to inflict upon Syrians.  Accountability and justice for the crimes, violations, and abuses committed against Syrians are essential to a stable, just, and enduring peace in Syria and the region.</p>

<p>Millions of people in Ethiopia continue to face acute food insecurity and extreme hunger as a direct result of conflict.  We are encouraged that the government of Ethiopia and regional authorities in Tigray and Afar have taken steps in recent weeks to enable the delivery of desperately needed food aid to war-affected communities.  We urge the parties to accelerate, uphold, and expand these efforts to ensure, as President Biden has said, immediate, sustained, and unimpeded humanitarian access to all Ethiopians affected by this conflict.  The United States stands ready to continue to assist in this life-saving endeavor.</p>
<p>In recent months, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has taken a series of encouraging actions that have laid the groundwork for an end to conflict, including lifting the state of emergency, releasing some political prisoners and detainees, and, in parallel with Tigrayan authorities, declaring an effective cessation of hostilities.  We are similarly encouraged that Tigrayan forces have withdrawn most of their forces from Afar and have reiterated their commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.  We now urge the parties, as my team and I have in recent days, to seize the opportunity to advance a negotiated ceasefire, including the necessary security arrangements, and call for the restoration of essential services in Tigray on an urgent basis.</p>
<p>The United States remains committed to a unified, prosperous, and sovereign Ethiopia and to supporting an inclusive political process to heal the country’s divisions and provide peace and security for all Ethiopians.</p>
