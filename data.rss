					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Zbigniew Rau, Polish Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, good morning, everyone.  It’s a great pleasure to have my friend, the Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, here in Washington at the State Department, and the timing could not be better in the sense that we have an extremely productive already Strategic Dialogue underway – long scheduled, long time – but of course, we’re also here at a time of real concern for European security because of Russia’s aggressive posture toward Ukraine.</p>
<p>Poland’s partnership, its leadership now of the OSCE, and the work we have done together over these many weeks to make clear to Russia that there are two paths before it: one of dialogue and diplomacy to resolve mutual concerns about security, or the path of aggression and massive consequences for Russia if it chooses that path – we have built these out together in absolute solidarity.  We have in many conversations over these past weeks and months, directly together but also with our colleagues from the – from NATO and the EU, made very clear that we are acting as one.  We strongly prefer that Russia choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue, but if it does not, we are fully prepared for the alternative.</p>
<p>So we have a lot to talk about today and, again, in the context of Poland’s OSCE chairmanship.  That’s a vital forum for Europe’s security and for continuing to look at ways to strengthen that security.  If Russia engages in that arena, that can also, I think, be productive for everyone, but it has to decide whether to do that or not.</p>
<p>But in any event, Zbigniew, it’s very good to have you here.  Thank you for being here and I look forward to our conversation.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER RAU:</b>  Thank you very much.  Tony, I am very happy that we can continue our dialogue.  I am here in the dual capacity as the Polish foreign minister and as the chairman-in-office of the OSCE.  Indeed, from these two perspectives, we have many things to discuss, and what concerns both of us is the extraordinarily difficult situation in and around Ukraine.  And this is the focus of my attention as the chairman-in-office of the OSCE but also as the foreign minister of a trusted ally of the United States.</p>
<p>So the common denominator of these two hats or perspective is that Poland and the U.S. shares the same values.  Our interests are very close, therefore our perspective of the crisis are very, very similar too.  And I must say that what is very important in our dialogue, in our meeting today is really the Strategic Dialogue that has just been relaunched – or this session of Strategic Dialogue between our two countries has been relaunched, and a long-overdue session is taking place, as the Secretary has just indicated – that we enjoy a very fruitful discussion concerning security issues, but also the economic cooperation, and so on and so on.  So these are the things that bring – has brought us together for decades.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.  Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken met today with Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau in Washington, D.C., as part of the U.S.-Poland Strategic Dialogue.

The Secretary emphasized the importance of the bilateral relationship and thanked Poland for its leadership on NATO’s Eastern Flank and as OSCE Chair for 2022. The Secretary and the Foreign Minister also discussed bilateral engagement on economic prosperity, clean energy diversification, and shared democratic values.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I send my best wishes to the people of Aotearoa New Zealand as you commemorate the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi on February 6.</p>
<p>Our relationship is one of mutual trust, common values, and unwavering friendship.  We work together to protect our natural environment, champion our diversity and cultures, and ensure a free, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Our ties continued to deepen in 2021.  I was honored to host Foreign Minister Mahuta at the Department of State during her visit to Washington, D.C., in November 2021.  The United States joined the Christchurch Call to Action to combat online violent extremism, and New Zealand signed the Artemis Accords with NASA, which aims to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.  We maintained a mutually beneficial security relationship – from enhancing interoperability through the visit of the USS Howard to disaster assistance provided by the USS Sampson.  Most recently, the United States and New Zealand worked together to provide humanitarian assistance to Tonga after the volcanic eruptions and tsunami waves.</p>
<p>We continue to stand together and do the <em>mahi</em> – work – as we face global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.  As we look forward to another year of cooperation, I am reminded of the<em> te reo Māori</em> phrase – <em>he waka eke noa</em> – we’re all in this together.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Counselor of the Department Derek Chollet will lead an interagency delegation to Sofia, Bucharest, and Brussels from February 7 to 11 to engage with our partners in Europe on a range of issues, and to consult with NATO Allies and the European Union partners on Russian aggression towards Ukraine.  Counselor Chollet’s trip is a continuation of the extensive diplomacy undertaken with our European Allies and partners in support of a united approach to Russia’s unprovoked <wbr />military build-up along Ukraine’s borders and our joint efforts to encourage Russia to choose diplomacy and de-escalation.</p>
<p>Counselor Chollet will meet with members of Bulgaria’s new government to continue the strategic dialogue talks begun in January 2020 on security, energy, and the rule of law.  In Romania, the Counselor will reaffirm the importance of the U.S.-Romania Strategic Partnership in addressing common threats and challenges, particularly with regard to U.S. troop deployments to help defend European allies in light of Russia&#8217;s military buildup on Ukraine’s borders.  Following both countries’ recent invitations to begin accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, he will offer U.S. support to the governments in their economic reform and anti-corruption efforts.</p>
<p>Counselor Chollet will then travel to Belgium to meet with NATO and European Union officials to discuss recent diplomatic engagements with Russia and joint efforts to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine, including Allies’ and partners’ readiness to impose massive consequences and severe economic costs on Russia.  Throughout his trip, the Counselor will reaffirm our ironclad commitment to NATO and our Allies and discuss how the United States can continue to support NATO countries, particularly on the eastern flank.</p>
<p>For more information about the trip and the United States’ steadfast support for Ukraine, please visit <a href="https://www.state.gov/united-with-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjAyMDQuNTI4ODc3NDEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlLmdvdi9Vbml0ZWRXaXRoVWtyYWluZSJ9.fxa3ymJOR1TV0z2rGSqH1rtw1jATcrOeg_VcfBfQjls/s/1006560560/br/126144448791-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1644066429113000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1wtgK3MZlCTq_KJTLL1WCa">www.state.gov/<wbr />UnitedWithUkraine</a>.</p>
