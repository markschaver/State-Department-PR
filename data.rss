					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is closely monitoring developments in Tunisia.  We have been in contact with Tunisian government officials to stress that solutions to Tunisia’s political and economic troubles should be based on the Tunisian constitution and the principles of democracy, human rights, and freedom.  We have been clear in urging all parties to avoid taking any actions that could stifle democratic discourse or lead to violence.  We are particularly troubled by reports that media offices have been closed and urge scrupulous respect for freedom of expression and other civil rights.</p>
<p>Tunisia must not squander its democratic gains.  The United States will continue to stand on the side of Tunisia’s democracy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On January 4, 2021, former Secretary of State Pompeo convened an independent Accountability Review Board (ARB) to review the facts and circumstance surrounding the murder of Mr. Edgar Flores Santos, a U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA/APHIS) Locally Employed (LE) Staff member in Tijuana, Mexico that occurred on September 30, 2020.  The body was discovered on October 1, 2020. The Tijuana ARB, as well as local and American law enforcement officials, concluded this unfortunate incident was a case of Mr. Flores being in the wrong place at the wrong time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ARB’s mandate was to determine the extent to which the incident was security related; whether security systems and procedures were adequate; whether those systems and procedures were properly implemented; the impact of intelligence and information availability; and other factors and circumstances which may be relevant to appropriate security management of U.S. missions abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ARB first met on February 23, 2021.  Former Ambassador George M. Staples served as Chair of the Board.  Board members included Ambassador Janice Jacobs, former USAID Mission Director Dirk Dijkerman, former Diplomatic Security Service Special Agents John Eustace, and Kimber Davidson.  On April 23, 2021, the Board submitted a report of its findings and recommendations to Secretary of State Blinken.  The Department of State appreciates the judgment and insight contained in the report and is grateful for the service of the Board.  Pursuant to law, the Secretary submitted a report to Congress on July 22, 2020, outlining the ARB’s recommendations and actions taken in response.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The United States Department of State, the USDA APHIS operations, and many other U.S. government agencies have a broad presence and role in Mexico.  The United States is Mexico’s largest agricultural trading partner and the growing agricultural ties between the United States and Mexico have created a vital role for the USDA’s APHIS in ensuring that existing trade between the two economies flows smoothly.  In particular, APHIS provides critical safeguarding of U.S. agriculture, helping to prevent the spread of animal and plant pests and diseases. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Advancing U.S. foreign policy objectives inherently involves diverse types of risk, and the Department recognizes that taking considered risks is often essential to achieving U.S. government objectives abroad.  Working in dangerous locations such as Mexico’s northern border area is critical to maintaining the safety, security, prosperity, and welfare of Americans.  The work accomplished by Mr. Flores and his USDA APHIS colleagues is vital to the agricultural security of the United States; the Department of State is grateful for their service.   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Tijuana operating environment, the Board found that the Department’s security systems and procedures were overall adequate and properly implemented, though the Board identified a few challenges in communication and information sharing that were immediately rectified following this incident.  Moreover, the Board did not find any U.S. government employee engaged in misconduct or perform unsatisfactorily in a way that contributed to this incident. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ARB issued 11 recommendations that focus on security systems and procedures and security management.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Security Systems and Procedures:  The ARB found that by all accounts, Mexican law enforcement and U.S. law enforcement agencies at the embassy responded quickly to the incident and shared available information and assisted the Regional Security Officer (RSO) in response to this incident.  However, the Board recommended that APHIS and the RSO take steps to ensure closer monitoring of security-related incidents, information sharing and integration of that intelligence into APHIS’s operational decisions.  The Department of State in coordination with USDA/APHIS will review policies and procedures to strengthen the security of APHIS personnel overseas.  U.S. Embassy Mexico City and all posts with an APHIS presence in their district will engage in robust publicity efforts to raise public awareness about what APHIS does, how it works, and how the work benefits Mexico.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Security Management:  The Board also made several recommendations that USDA and State will take to improve the safety of field inspectors related to their roles and responsibilities; program requirements considering threats and vulnerabilities; and enrolling USDA/APHIS locally employed staff in the Department of State’s worldwide standardized emergency notification system.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of society is a U.S. foreign policy priority.  Disability rights are human rights.  And today, July 26, the United States celebrates the 31st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the world’s first comprehensive civil rights law for persons with disabilities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ADA has inspired the world to see disability through the lens of rights and equity and expanded opportunities for persons with disabilities to contribute to our global progress.  This landmark U.S. law sparked a global shift of perspectives from viewing persons with disabilities as “objects” of charity to viewing persons with disabilities as “subjects” with rights, who are active, contributing members of society capable of exercising those rights.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The United States is committed to promoting disability rights at home and abroad.  Last month, President Biden issued Executive Order 14035 establishing that it is the policy of this Administration to cultivate a federal workforce that draws from the full diversity of the nation, including Americans with disabilities.  At the State Department, we strive to be a model of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, where all employees – working domestically and abroad – are treated with dignity and respect.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Beginning on July 11, tens of thousands of Cubans across the island took to the streets to  peacefully demand their fundamental freedoms and a better future.  The Cuban government responded with violence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, democracies around the world are <a href="https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-cuba/"><span class="s2">coming together</span></a> to support the Cuban people, calling on the Cuban government to respect Cubans’ demands for universal human rights.  As President Biden said, the Cuban people made a “clarion call for freedom.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Cuban government has responded not by recognizing the voices of its own people, but by further stifling those voices through arbitrary detentions and secret summary trials lacking due process guarantees.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The United States will continue to support the Cuban people’s desire for freedom and to determine their own future.  This joint statement demonstrates that the Cuban people are not alone in their aspirations.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The below is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman traveled to the People’s Republic of China for meetings with State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other PRC officials from July 25-26.  The Deputy Secretary expressed the United States’ sincere condolences for the lives lost in the devastating floods in Henan Province this week. The Deputy Secretary and State Councilor Wang had a frank and open discussion about a range of issues, demonstrating the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between our two countries. They discussed ways to set terms for responsible management of the U.S-China relationship. The Deputy Secretary underscored that the United States welcomes the stiff competition between our countries—and that we intend to continue to strengthen our own competitive hand—but that we do not seek conflict with the PRC.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Deputy Secretary raised concerns in private – as we have in public – about a range of PRC actions that run counter to our values and interests and those of our allies and partners, and that undermine the international rules-based order. In particular, she raised our concerns about human rights, including Beijing’s anti-democratic crackdown in Hong Kong; the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang; abuses in Tibet; and the curtailing of media access and freedom of the press. She also spoke about our concerns about Beijing’s conduct in cyberspace; across the Taiwan Strait; and in the East and South China Seas.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Deputy Secretary also raised the cases of American and Canadian citizens detained in the PRC or under exit bans and reminded PRC officials that people are not bargaining chips. The Deputy Secretary reiterated concerns about the PRC’s unwillingness to cooperate with the World Health Organization and allow a second phase investigation in the PRC into COVID-19’s origins. At the same time, the Deputy Secretary affirmed the importance of cooperation in areas of global interest, such as the climate crisis, counternarcotics, nonproliferation, and regional concerns including DPRK, Iran, Afghanistan, and Burma.</span></p>

<p>On behalf of the Government of the United States of America, I wish July 26<sup>th</sup> a joyous Independence Day to the Maldivian people.</p>
<p>The partnership between the United States and Maldives has only grown stronger as the years have passed.  Our two countries share a joint commitment to democracy, human rights, the rule of law, multilateralism, and equitable prosperity.  Maldives has proven itself a champion of these values, and through our cooperation we will continue to find new ways to further advance our efforts.  We hope to soon appoint a dedicated Ambassador to Maldives who will serve as the cornerstone of our growing relationship.  We also look forward to working with Maldives as it assumes the Presidency of the United Nations General Assembly this year so that our efforts can be further expanded to the benefit of all nations.  While great challenges remain, including ending the COVID-19 pandemic and combatting climate change, through partnerships such as ours we will persevere and emerge as stronger nations.</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing our partnership into the future.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Government of the United States of America, I wish July 26<sup>th</sup> a joyous Independence Day to the Maldivian people.</p>
<p>The partnership between the United States and Maldives has only grown stronger as the years have passed.  Our two countries share a joint commitment to democracy, human rights, the rule of law, multilateralism, and equitable prosperity.  Maldives has proven itself a champion of these values, and through our cooperation we will continue to find new ways to further advance our efforts.  We hope to soon appoint a dedicated Ambassador to Maldives who will serve as the cornerstone of our growing relationship.  We also look forward to working with Maldives as it assumes the Presidency of the United Nations General Assembly this year so that our efforts can be further expanded to the benefit of all nations.  While great challenges remain, including ending the COVID-19 pandemic and combatting climate change, through partnerships such as ours we will persevere and emerge as stronger nations.</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing our partnership into the future.</p>
