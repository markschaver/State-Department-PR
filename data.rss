<p>Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration Julieta Valls Noyes will travel to New York, New York, May 18-20, where she will attend the International Migration Review Forum (IMRF) to discuss international cooperation on migration and meet with UN and government officials.</p>
<p>This inaugural meeting is the first quadrennial IMRF since UN Member States endorsed the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) in December 2018. The IMRF will consist of four interactive multi-stakeholder roundtable discussions and policy debates, and a General Debate (plenary). The GCM outlines 23 objectives covering all aspects of migration and is based on a collective realization that no single government can effectively govern migration alone.</p>
<p>For additional information on the GCM, visit <a href="https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA1MTcuNTgwNTUwNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZS5nb3YvZ2xvYmFsLWNvbXBhY3QtZm9yLXNhZmUtb3JkZXJseS1hbmQtcmVndWxhci1taWdyYXRpb24tZ2NtLyJ9.mrzwy559WbfwAkgmcdJiHaN5XrUyBubsFCK3Qc2bNt8/s/1250718950/br/131465035729-l">https://www.state.gov/global-compact-for-safe-orderly-and-regular-migration-gcm/</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>On May 18-19, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Dr. Karen Donfried will visit Sofia, Bulgaria, for a series of high-level meetings to reaffirm the strong bilateral partnership between the United States and Bulgaria.  During her visit, Assistant Secretary Donfried will meet with senior Bulgarian government officials and leaders of political parties, and discuss a range of key issues, including our robust bilateral security cooperation, NATO’s unified response to Russia’s unprovoked war against Ukraine, the U.S. commitment to supporting Bulgaria’s energy security and efforts to combat corruption, and other regional issues.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of high-level engagements between the United States and Bulgaria.  Most recently, Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and Department of State Under Secretary for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Kirill Petkov during his May 9-10 visit to Washington, D.C.  Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visited Bulgaria in March, and State Department Counselor Derek Chollet visited Sofia in February.  Assistant Secretary Donfried’s visit will build on these recent engagements and set the stage for the next meeting of the U.S.-Bulgaria bilateral strategic dialogue later this year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin Room</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It’s a great pleasure to have my friend, the Greek foreign minister, here at the State Department.  This has been an important and incredibly productive couple of days, notably with the prime minister’s visit, his meeting with President Biden yesterday, the prime minister’s appearance before Congress today.  And it’s upon us now – Nikos and myself – to follow up on all the instructions we’re getting from President Biden and Prime Minister Mitsotakis to continue to do the work that has brought partnership between the United States and Greece – at least in my judgment – to its highest point ever.</p>
<p>We are grateful for that partnership: the work that we are doing together to stand against Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, and to stand with Ukraine; and the work that we’re doing together to strengthen and diversify energy security, including in the Eastern Mediterranean; the work we’re doing together through the Strategic Dialogue that we conducted and that we’re going to continue across so many different areas in the relationship between Greece and the United States.</p>
<p>So I’m grateful to have this opportunity with Nikos to follow up on the meeting between the President and the prime minister, to continue the important work we’re doing together to build the strongest possible relationship between Greece and the United States.</p>
<p>Nikos.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER DENDIAS:</b>  Thank you.  It’s a great opportunity to be here today after a spectacular meeting with President Biden yesterday, and, if you allow me to say, a historic speech of my prime minister &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Yes.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER DENDIAS:  </b>&#8212; Prime Minister Mitsotakis – to Congress today.  I’m looking forward to discussing Ukraine.  After the Russian invasion, I think it’s good to compare notes and see where we’re going from here.  Also, I will brief you on the situation in the southeast Mediterranean, and see how the United States could be more present in the region – the 3+1 model, for example.  It’s something that is of huge importance for us, and I would like to discuss how we can enhance it, and also discuss challenges to a rules-based international order all around.</p>
<p>I have to say it is important for us that the United States understands that no ground should be left to revisionist power who try to change this rules-based international order.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER DENDIAS:</b>  Thank you so much for the opportunity, and I’ll say it’s great to see you well again after the COVID.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you, my friend.  Appreciate it.  Come on in.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State is announcing the launch of a new Conflict Observatory to capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine.  The program encompasses the documentation, verification, and dissemination of open-source evidence regarding the actions of Russia’s forces during President Putin’s brutal war of choice.  The Conflict Observatory will analyze and preserve publicly and commercially available information, including satellite imagery and information shared via social media, consistent with international legal standards, for use in ongoing and future accountability mechanisms.  This includes maintaining rigorous chain-of-custody procedures for future civil and criminal legal processes under appropriate jurisdictions.  An online platform will publicly share the Conflict Observatory’s documentation to help refute Russia’s disinformation efforts and shine a light on abuses.</p>
<p>This program is being established with an initial $6 million investment, with future funding to come from the European Democratic Resilience Initiative (EDRI).  In March, the White House announced at least $320 million in funds for EDRI to bolster democratic resilience, advance anti-corruption efforts, and promote respect for human rights in Ukraine and its region.  This new Conflict Observatory program is part of a range of U.S. government efforts at both national and international levels designed to ensure future accountability for Russia’s horrific actions.</p>
<p>The Conflict Observatory is a collaborative endeavor with Esri, a leading geographic information systems company, Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab, the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative, and PlanetScape Ai.  The U.S. government has also contributed commercial satellite imagery to these efforts.  We expect other international partner organizations to join as the program proceeds.  Reports and analyses will be available online through the ConflictObservatory.org website.</p>
<p>The Conflict Observatory is a further demonstration of the United States’ steadfast support for the people of Ukraine as they valiantly defend their country and their freedom in response to President Putin’s premeditated, unjustified, and unprovoked war.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States affirms today, on the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia, and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT), that the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons are the same human rights to which all persons are entitled. As enshrined in Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, “ll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”</p>
<p>Too many LGBTQI+ persons live under the shadow of discrimination, violence, and fear. Global data makes clear that the dehumanization of LGBTQI+ persons is systemic, pervasive, and often violent.  Homophobia, biphobia, interphobia, and transphobia are deeply entrenched in societies across the world, including here in the United States.  Countless persons are at extreme risk for being themselves.</p>
<p>We remain committed to ending this intolerance. Everyone deserves to live with respect, dignity, and safety.  The United States affirms that all LGBTQI+ individuals, couples, and their families are valid and valuable.  In line with commitments made at President Biden’s Summit for Democracy and resulting Year of Action, we will continue to support reforms to yield a world free from discrimination and violence, so that all of our LGBTQI+ friends, colleagues, neighbors, and family may live freely with dignity and equal respect for their human rights.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I congratulate the Norwegian people as you celebrate Constitution Day.  This year, I also send a hearty congratulations for setting a new record for the largest number of gold medals won by a single country at a Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>As Norwegians celebrate their Constitution of 1814, Americans are reminded of the cherished democratic values that our two countries share that bind us together.  The close relationship between our two nations stems in part from waves of Norwegian emigration to the United States from 1825 to 1940, giving the United States today nearly as many people of Norwegian ancestry as the population of Norway.  The United States and Norway have been NATO Allies for more than 70 years, and we stand together in our shared commitment to freedom, collective security, and human rights.  As Allies, we defend against threats to democratic values and address global challenges.  The United States appreciates the close coordination with Norway as we respond to the actions of regimes that seek to repress fundamental freedoms and undermine the international rules-based order.  This coordination is all the more important as we work together to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine.  As partners, we will deepen our collaboration to combat the climate crisis and strengthen our vibrant people-to-people ties in the years to come.</p>
<p>I join you in celebrating this anniversary and send best wishes for health and prosperity to all Norwegians.  Gratulerer med dagen!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States is designating Attorney General of Guatemala Maria Consuelo Porras Argueta de Porres (“Porras”) due to her involvement in significant corruption.  During her tenure, Porras repeatedly obstructed and undermined anticorruption investigations in Guatemala to protect her political allies and gain undue political favor.  Porras’s pattern of obstruction includes reportedly ordering prosecutors in Guatemala’s Public Ministry to ignore cases based on political considerations and firing prosecutors who investigate cases involving acts of corruption.</p>
<p>This public designation is made under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2022. Under this authority, designated officials of foreign governments involved in significant corruption and their immediate family members are ineligible for entry into the United States.  The Department is also designating Porras’s husband Gilberto de Jesus Porres de Paz.  The designation follows Porras’s September 2021 inclusion on the list of corrupt and undemocratic actors submitted to the U.S. Congress under Section 353 of the United States – Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act. The Department is actively considering additional designations under Section 353, including making new designations public at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>These designations reaffirm the commitment of the United States to combat corruption, which undermines the Guatemalan people’s faith in their democratic institutions.  The United States continues to stand with all Guatemalans in support of democracy and the rule of law and against those who would undermine these principles for personal gain.</p>
