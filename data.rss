<p>In a display of the strengthening ties between the United States and Italy, the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), the U.S. Mission in Italy, and other U.S. and local officials celebrated the groundbreaking of the new U.S. Consulate General in Milan on April 6.</p>
<p>The new U.S. Consulate General campus, which includes the restored iconic Liberty Building, Liberty Plaza, and Parade Ground, will offer a modern public gathering space and gateway welcoming visitors and staff.</p>
<p>SHoP Architects of New York is the design architect and Caddell Construction Company, LLC of Montgomery, Alabama, is the construction contractor.  An estimated $65 million will be directly invested in the local economy and approximately 450 workers will be employed at the peak of construction activities.  The new U.S. Consulate General is scheduled for completion in 2025 and will provide an ecologically resilient platform for diplomacy in northern Italy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The world has been shocked and appalled by the atrocities committed by Russia’s forces in Bucha and across Ukraine.  Ukraine’s forces bravely continue to defend their country and their freedom, and the United States, along with our Allies and partners, stand steadfast in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation from the President earlier today, the immediate drawdown of security assistance valued at up to $100 million to meet Ukraine’s urgent need for additional anti-armor systems.  This authorization is the sixth drawdown of arms, equipment, and supplies from Department of Defense inventories for Ukraine since August 2021.  Combined with $300 million in assistance announced by the Department of Defense on April 1 under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, this additional drawdown brings the total U.S. security assistance commitment to Ukraine to more than $2.4 billion since the beginning of this Administration, and more than $1.7 billion* *since the beginning of Russia’s brutal assault against Ukraine began on February 24.</p>
<p>In addition to what we have provided, more than 30 countries have joined us to deliver security assistance to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began. Together, we are delivering security assistance every day, and we are expediting shipments of even more of the arms and defense equipment Ukraine is using to defend itself.  As we strengthen Ukraine’s position on the battlefield and at the negotiating table, we will also work with our Allies and partners to gather information to document reported abuses and make it available to the appropriate bodies to hold those responsible to account.</p>
<p>United with our Allies and partners, we will continue to provide security assistance in support of Ukraine’s defense, as well as economic support, and humanitarian aid for communities devastated by Russia’s ruthless brutality.</p>

<p>The below is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>On April 5 Special Representative for the DPRK Sung Kim met with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) Special Representative for Korean Peninsula Affairs Liu Xiaoming in Washington, D.C., to discuss recent developments in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).</p>
<p>Special Representative Kim condemned the DPRK’s March 24 ICBM launch, the latest in a series of increasingly escalatory actions by the DPRK. He noted that each of the DPRK’s 13 ballistic missile launches this year constituted clear violations of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and posed a serious threat to regional stability, and reiterated the importance of responding firmly to these escalatory actions. Special Representative Kim reaffirmed that the United States is committed to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy with the DPRK. Special Representative Kim and Special Representative Liu discussed opportunities to advance our shared goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and how to encourage the DPRK to engage in meaningful negotiations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Following a coordinated German law enforcement action, the United States today took further action to combat Russian-related illicit finance and cybercrime by sanctioning the world’s largest darknet market for Russian speakers, Hydra, and the virtual currency exchange Garantex.</p>
<p>Today’s action – coordinated with our allies and partners – disrupts ransomware infrastructure and actors and targets the abuse of virtual currency to launder ransom payments.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Hydra, which provides a marketplace for illicit services, including ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) and hacking services and software, stolen personal information, counterfeit currency, stolen virtual currency, and illicit drugs. The U.S. Department of Treasury also designated Garantex, a virtual currency exchange that has processed millions of dollars in transactions associated with illicit actors, including nearly $6 million from Russian ransomware gang Conti and more than $2 million from Hydra.</p>
<p>The United States is committed to taking action against those who engage in money laundering or the financing of terrorism and allow their systems to be abused for illicit purposes. Wanton disregard for regulations and compliance by persons that run virtual currency exchanges will be investigated and, if appropriate, those responsible will be held accountable for their actions. The United States urges the international community to effectively implement international Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) standards with respect to virtual asset, particularly regarding virtual assets service providers.</p>
<p>For more information on today’s action, please see Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0701" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Joint Base Andrews</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good morning, everyone.  As this Russian tide is receding from parts of Ukraine, the world is seeing the death and destruction left in its wake, and we’re seeing in particular the horror that’s been left behind in Bucha, something that is touching people literally around the world.</p>
<p>What we’ve seen in Bucha is not the random act of a rogue unit.  It’s a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities.  The reports are more than credible.  The evidence is there for the world to see.  This reinforces our determination and the determination of countries around the world to make sure that one way or another, one day or another, there is accountability for those who committed these acts, for those who ordered them.  There’s also a strong determination to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to continue to support Ukraine in its brave fight to push the Russian aggression out of Ukraine, and of course, to sustain and increase the pressure on Russia to stop this aggression.</p>
<p>We’re heading off to Brussels now for a meeting of the NATO foreign ministers, for a meeting of the G7 foreign ministers, the leading democratic economies in the world, all of which will go to supporting the efforts that – accountability and support for Ukraine, increase pressure on Russia.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Mr. Secretary &#8212;</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Mr. Secretary, when you talk about basically a deliberate campaign to kill civilians, does the U.S. have evidence linking senior Russian officials in Moscow to either ordering or knowledge of the acts being committed?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  We’re working, as are others, to put the evidence together to support the efforts of the Ukrainian prosecutor general, to support the efforts of the UN Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry that we helped establish, marshaling all of this, putting all of this together.</p>
<p>We said before the aggression that we anticipated that if it went forward, there would be atrocities committed.  Information that we’ve seen going into the aggression suggested that this would be part of the Russian campaign.  Horrifically, tragically, what we’re seeing in Bucha and in other places supports that.  But in all of these instances, there’s a very important effort to put the evidence together, to compile it, to document it, to support the different investigations that are going on.  That’s what we’re doing.  That’s what others are doing.  This will play out over time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what’s vital is to sustain and build on the support for Ukraine, to sustain and build on the pressure against Russia to bring this war to an end, to stop the death and destruction that Russia’s perpetrating in Ukraine.  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today in Zagreb, Croatia, at the U.S.-Croatia Forum, Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs Lee Satterfield announced an expansion of the Fulbright Program to secondary-level educators in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) from Croatia. Today’s announcement follows the U.S.-Croatia Strategic Dialogue, which was held in Washington, D.C. in March and mapped future areas of cooperation between the two countries on global issues, defense and security, energy and climate change, regional cooperation, trade and investment, and people-to-people exchanges. The announcement also comes as the U.S. and Croatia celebrate 30 years of bilateral diplomatic relations, as well as the 30th anniversary of the Fulbright Program in Croatia.</p>
<p>The Fulbright Teaching Excellence and Achievement Program will bring Croatian teachers in the field of STEM to the United States for six-week Fulbright programs of peer learning and leadership development. The first STEM teachers from Croatia are slated to begin their program in January 2023.</p>
<p>The first inter-state agreement signed between the United States and Croatia was the establishment of the Fulbright Program in the Southeast European nation in 1992. More than 300 Croatians are Fulbright alumni, including a former President of Croatia. Also, more than 200 Americans have participated in the Fulbright Program as American Scholars and Students in Croatia.</p>
<p>The Fulbright Teaching Excellence and Achievement Program newly launched in Croatia brings approximately 200 teachers to the United States each year from 70 countries around the world for six-week programs. International teachers travel to a U.S. university to engage in academic seminars focusing on pedagogy, technology training, and teaching placements at local secondary schools. Participants observe classrooms, team-teach, and share their expertise with educators and students at the host university and American K-12 schools. Each year approximately 75 local K-12 schools across the U.S. receive these visiting teachers, and we estimate they bring their culture, history and global skills to share with more than 15,000 American school children. Program participants also take part in civic and cultural activities in their host communities.</p>
<p>The Fulbright Teaching Excellence and Achievement Program partners with the following U.S. host universities in 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appalachian State University (NC)</li>
<li>California State University &#8211; Chico</li>
<li>Florida Gulf Coast University</li>
<li>Georgia State University</li>
<li>Kent State University (OH)</li>
<li>Montana State University</li>
<li>University of Arkansas</li>
<li>University of Massachusetts – Lowell</li>
<li>University of Nevada &#8211; Reno</li>
<li>University of North Carolina &#8211; Greensboro</li>
<li>University of North Carolina &#8211; Wilmington</li>

<p>The following is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>Today, Deputy Secretary Sherman met in Washington with Republic of Korea President-elect Yoon Suk Yeol’s U.S.-ROK Policy Consultation Delegation, led by National Assembly Representative Park Jin.  The Deputy Secretary congratulated the delegation for President-elect Yoon’s victory and reaffirmed the U.S.-ROK Alliance as the linchpin of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.  The Deputy Secretary highlighted the U.S.-ROK Alliance’s over six decades of cooperation and noted she looks forward to working with the new administration when it takes office in May. She also stressed the importance of U.S.-ROK cooperation in tackling the most pressing global challenges of the 21st century, including threats to regional security from the DPRK, supply chain resiliency, combatting the climate crisis, and ending the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Deputy Secretary also highlighted the importance of ongoing U.S. and ROK support for Ukraine in the face of President Putin’s continued brutal war.  Deputy Secretary Sherman condemned the DPRK’s recent ballistic missile launches, which violated multiple UN Security Council resolutions, and highlighted the United States’ readiness to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy with the DPRK. Deputy Secretary Sherman also reaffirmed that the United States’ commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea remains ironclad and welcomed joint efforts to make progress on achieving the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.<input type="hidden" data-filter="111000000001" /></p>
