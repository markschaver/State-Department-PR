					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The text of the following statement was released by the G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union.</p>
<p><i>Begin Text:</i></p>
<p>We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union strongly condemn the continued testing of ballistic missiles by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), including the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) launch conducted on March 24, 2022.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2022, the DPRK has conducted an unprecedented series of missile tests which build on ballistic missile tests conducted in 2021, including launches of new so-called hypersonic missiles, and has claimed a submarine-launched ballistic missile test. These tests demonstrate the DPRK’s continued efforts to expand and further develop its ballistic missile capabilities. We deeply regret that the DPRK, with the most recent launches, has also abandoned its self-declared moratorium on ICBM launches. We strongly condemn these acts which are in blatant violation of the DPRK’s obligations under numerous UN Security Council resolutions including resolution 2397 (2017). These reckless actions threaten regional and international peace and security, pose a dangerous and unpredictable risk to international civil aviation and maritime navigation in the region, and demand a united response by the international community, including by further measures to be taken by the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>We strongly urge the DPRK to fully comply with all legal obligations arising from the relevant Security Council resolutions. We call on the DPRK to accept the repeated offers of dialogue put forward by all parties concerned, including the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan. We, the G7 foreign ministers and the High Representative of the European Union, also call on the DPRK to abandon its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner.</p>
<p>We are clear that the dire humanitarian situation in the DPRK is the result of the DPRK’s diversion of the DPRK’s resources into weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs rather than into the welfare of its people.</p>
<p>We call on all States to fully and effectively implement all restrictive measures relating to the DPRK imposed by the UN Security Council and to address the risk of weapons of mass destruction proliferation from the DPRK as an urgent priority. We note with concern the report by the Panel of Experts established in pursuant to resolution 1874 (2009) that illicit ship-to-ship transfers continue to take place. We remain ready to assist in and strengthen capacities for effective sanctions implementation. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, we commend the work of the 1718 Committee, which has swiftly approved all Covid-19 related sanctions exemption requests for humanitarian assistance for the DPRK.</p>
<p>The G7 are committed to working with all relevant partners towards the goal of peace on the Korean Peninsula and to upholding the rules-based international order.</p>

		<title>United States and Allies Impose Additional Sanctions on the Burmese Military Regime</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>As we approach one year since the horrific violence perpetrated by the Burmese military on Armed Forces Day 2021, in which more than 100 people were killed, the United States is imposing sanctions on five Burmese individuals and five entities in response to the regime’s brutal crackdown against the people of Burma.  Since the February 2021 military coup, the military regime has only intensified its violent crackdown and killed more than 1,700 people, including women, children, and aid workers.  Regime security forces have detained more than 13,000 people, imprisoned former State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and other former government leaders, and dispersed peaceful demonstrations with lethal force.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has designated Burmese business leaders Aung Hlaing Oo, Naing Htut Aung, and Sit Taing Aung, as well as Burmese military officials Zaw Hein and Ko Ko Oo.  OFAC has also designated the 66th Light Infantry Division, which has been tied to the “Christmas Eve massacre” in December, for its responsibility for the arbitrary detention or torture of people in Burma.  Additionally, OFAC has designated Myanmar Chemical &amp; Machinery Company Limited (MC&amp;M), International Gateways Groups of Company Limited (IGG), Htoo Group of Companies (Htoo Group), and the Asian Green Development Bank (AGDB), companies owned by Burmese business leaders.  All of these designations were made under Executive Order 14014 “Blocking Property with Respect to the Situation in Burma.”  With these designations, the United States government has sanctioned 27 entities and 70 individuals for their actions in support of the regime.</p>
<p>I recently announced the United States’ determination that members of the Burmese military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Rohingya, most of whom are Muslim.  We also recognize that for decades the Burmese military has killed, raped, and committed other atrocities against members of other ethnic and religious minority groups.  Many of these military members are in power today.  Since the coup, the military regime has shown it will target any person, regardless of ethnicity, religion, gender, or age, in order to maintain its grip on power.</p>
<p>We have taken these actions today in response to the regime’s escalating violence, to show our strong support for the people of Burma, and to promote accountability in connection with the coup and the violence perpetrated by the regime.  We will continue to impose costs on the military regime and those who support it until it ceases the violence and restores Burma’s path to democracy.</p>
<p>The United States appreciates the coordinated actions taken today by the United Kingdom and Canada under their respective sanctions programs to target Burmese actors responsible for violence and repression.</p>
<p>For more information about today’s action, see Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0679" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is designating six individuals for their support of the terrorist group Boko Haram.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has added Nigerian nationals Abdurrahman Ado Musa, Salihu Yusuf Adamu, Bashir Ali Yusuf, Muhammed Ibrahim Isa, Ibrahim Ali Alhassan, and Surajo Abubakar Muhammad to the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, pursuant to Executive Order 13224, as amended, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Boko Haram.</p>
<p>Today’s action follows the United Arab Emirates’ prosecutions, convictions, and designations of these individuals for supporting terrorism.  The Department of State designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization on November 14, 2013.  The Nigeria-based group is responsible for numerous attacks in the northern and northeastern regions of the country as well as in the Lake Chad Basin in Cameroon, Chad, and Niger that have killed thousands of people since 2009.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program is now offering a reward for information on Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov for their alleged involvement in computer intrusions, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and damage to the property of an energy facility offenses.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement marks the first time that RFJ has named any foreign government security personnel under its critical infrastructure reward offer.</p>
<p>RFJ, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of Akulov, Gavrilov, Tyukov, or any other person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of a foreign government, aids or abets a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which may include participation in malicious cyber activities against U.S. critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>These officers were members of an FSB component known as Center 16 and worked at a specific operational group known as Military Unit 71330, known by cybersecurity researchers as “Dragonfly,” “Energetic Bear,” and “Crouching Yeti.”</p>
<p>These FSB officers conspired to commit computer intrusions, including “supply chain attacks,” in furtherance of the Russian government’s efforts to maintain surreptitious, unauthorized, and persistent access to the computer networks of companies and other entities in the international energy sector, including oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants, and other utility and electrical grid companies.  Specifically, the conspirators targeted the software and hardware that controls equipment in power generation facilities, known as industrial control systems or supervisory control and data acquisition systems.  Access to such systems would have provided the Russian government the ability to, among other things, disrupt and damage such computer systems at a future date of its choosing..</p>
<p>In total, the defendants and the co-conspirators targeted more than 500 U.S. and foreign energy-sector companies in 135 other countries.  In just one phase of their hacking campaign, the conspirators installed malware on more than 17,000 unique devices worldwide.</p>
<p>More information about this reward offer is located on the Rewards for Justice website at <a class="external-link" href="https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/foreign-malicious-cyber-activity-against-u-s-critical-infrastructure/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/malicious_cyber_activity.html</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>. We encourage anyone with information on the malicious cyberactivity of Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov to contact Rewards for Justice via the Tor-based tips-reporting channel at: he5dybnt7sr6cm32xt77pazmtm65flqy6irivtflruqfc5ep7eiodiad.onion (Tor browser required).</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1984, the program has paid in excess of $200 million to more than 100 people across the globe who provided actionable information that helped prevent terrorism, bring terrorist leaders to justice, and resolve threats to U.S. national security. Follow us on Twitter at <a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program is offering a reward for information on Russia-based hacker Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement marks the first time that RFJ has listed a specific cyber actor under its critical infrastructure reward offer.</p>
<p>RFJ, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of Gladkikh or any other person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of a foreign government, aids or abets a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which may include participation in malicious cyber activities against U.S. critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Between May and September 2017, Gladkikh, a computer programmer employed by a leading research organization of the Russian Ministry of Defense, and co-conspirators hacked the systems of a refinery located outside the United States and installed malware designed to prevent the refinery’s safety systems from functioning (<i>i.e.</i>, by causing the industrial control system to operate in an unsafe manner while maintaining the appearance that it was operating normally).  Between February and July 2018, the conspirators researched similar refineries in the United States, which were owned by a U.S. company, and unsuccessfully attempted to hack the U.S. company’s computer systems.</p>
<p>Gladkikh conducted these malicious offensive cyber operations as an employee of the Russian Ministry of Defense’s Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (a.k.a. “TsNIIKhM”), in its Applied Development Center, with other co-conspirators.</p>
<p>More information about this reward offer is located on the Rewards for Justice website at <a class="external-link" href="https://rewardsforjustice.net/rewards/foreign-malicious-cyber-activity-against-u-s-critical-infrastructure/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/malicious_cyber_activity.html</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>. We encourage anyone with information on Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh’s malicious cyberactivity to contact Rewards for Justice via the Tor-based tips-reporting channel at: he5dybnt7sr6cm32xt77pazmtm65flqy6irivtflruqfc5ep7eiodiad.onion (Tor browser required).</p>
<p>Since RFJ’s inception in 1984, the program has paid in excess of $200 million to more than 100 people across the globe who provided actionable information that helped prevent terrorism, bring terrorist leaders to justice, and resolve threats to U.S. national security. Follow us on Twitter at <a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and people of the United States of America, I congratulate the people of Greece as you celebrate the 201st anniversary of the founding of the Hellenic Republic.</p>
<p>Today, we celebrate the history and democratic values that unite our countries and peoples.  The United States views Greece as a key partner and NATO Ally as we advance our shared goals for peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, Western Balkans, Black Sea region, and beyond, strengthened by our updated Mutual Defense Cooperation Agreement.</p>
<p>Our relationship has never been more important than at this critical moment in history after the Russian government launched its unprovoked war in Ukraine, including against the Greek diaspora in Mariupol, a bastion of Hellenic identity.  On behalf of the United States, I thank Greece for its unyielding and steadfast support for Ukraine’s people, sovereignty, and democracy.</p>
<p>The founders of the United States drew inspiration from ancient Greece’s example, as they framed the U.S. Constitution and formed the world’s first modern democracy.  Inspired by these democratic ideals, American Philhellenes proudly stood shoulder to shoulder with the people of Greece as they, too, fought for their independence.  Building on the shared values that have guided our friendship for more than two centuries, our relationship is stronger now than ever, fostering security and prosperity for both our countries and the broader transatlantic alliance.</p>
<p>The United States continues to stand with Greece as we deepen our strong and historic relationship and take it to even greater heights, guided by democratic values that were born in Greece.  And so, I wish the people of Greece a year of peace, prosperity, and good health, as we celebrate another year of Greece’s independence.  Xronia Polla!</p>

<p>The below is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman spoke today with Republic of Korea (ROK) First Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong Kun and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Mori Takeo about continued trilateral U.S.-ROK-Japan cooperation regarding the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) March 24 intercontinental ballistic missile launch, which was a clear violation of multiple United Nation Security Council resolutions.  Deputy Secretary Sherman and her counterparts jointly condemned the DPRK’s increasingly escalatory launches and called on the DPRK to stop its destabilizing actions and return to diplomacy.  The Deputy Secretary also reaffirmed the ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of the ROK and Japan.  Deputy Secretary Sherman stressed the importance of close coordination with our allies and partners to address the threats posed by the DPRK and to advance our shared objective of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
