					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p align="left"><i>The following is the text of a joint statement by the Governments of the United States of America and France, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Begin Text:</i></p>
<p align="left">France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States have intensely engaged with the governments of Kosovo and Serbia in the past months in order to find a pragmatic solution to allow eligible Kosovo citizens to exercise their right to participate in Serbia&#8217;s elections on April 3, 2022.</p>
<p align="left">We acknowledge that it is the Kosovo Government’s prerogative to decide whether or not to permit facilitation of voting in another country’s elections. While we appreciate Serbia’s availability to find a solution, it is with great disappointment that we take note of Kosovo Government’s decision to reject a constructive proposal presented by the Quint. With this decision, Kosovo’s Government failed to demonstrate its commitment to the principle of protecting the civil and political rights of all its citizens, including of members of minority groups.</p>
<p align="left">Such an attitude of the Kosovo Government is not in line with our values and principles and will undermine its European aspirations.</p>
<p align="left">Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we welcomed Kosovo’s alignment with the statements and declarations EU and the Quint members adopted. However, Kosovo is also expected to uphold its core values and responsibility towards regional stability and respect democratic processes, as well as to commit to protection of the rights of members of minority groups.</p>
<p align="left">We expect the Kosovo Government to act in the interests of all its citizens, to work to decrease tensions and to engage constructively in the EU-facilitated Dialogue on normalization of relations with Serbia. This is crucial to achieve progress towards a comprehensive normalization agreement that will ultimately unlock the EU perspective of Kosovo.</p>
<p align="left">We reiterate our strong call upon Kosovo and Serbia to refrain from any actions and rhetoric that increase tensions and may lead to incidents.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>The United States has a special and longstanding relationship with the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau – collectively known as the Freely Associated States (FAS). We are currently engaged in negotiating amendments to certain provisions of the Compacts of Free Association with the FAS, and completing the negotiations is a priority for this Administration.</p>
<p>In light of the critical nature of these complex negotiations, President Biden is appointing Ambassador Joseph Yun as Special Presidential Envoy for Compact Negotiations. Ambassador Yun has more than 33 years of diplomatic experience, including as the U.S. special representative for North Korea policy and as the United States Ambassador to Malaysia.</p>
<p>The Compacts reflect the close relationships between the United States and the FAS and are a critical source of regional security, stability, and prosperity. Through these negotiations, we will strengthen our enduring partnerships with our close Pacific Island partners and ensure a free and open and prosperous Indo-Pacific region.</p>

		<title>Aleksey Navalny Unjustly Convicted Again</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>We condemn Russian authorities’ politically-motivated conviction and sentencing of opposition leader Aleksey Navalny on additional spurious charges to nine more years in a high security prison. This outlandish prison term is a continuation of the Kremlin’s years-long assault on Navalny and on his movement for government transparency and accountability. Of course, Navalny’s true crime in the eyes of the Kremlin is his work as an anti-corruption activist and opposition politician, for which he and his associates have been branded “extremists” by Russian authorities.</p>
<p>Despite his near-fatal poisoning with a nerve agent in 2020 by Russia’s security services and his unjust imprisonment since January 2020, Navalny has continued to speak out against the Kremlin’s suppression of freedom of expression in Russia, and the increasing restrictions on the ability of Russia’s citizens to access information and communicate freely with each other and the outside world. This campaign has intensified as the Kremlin seeks to hide the truth of its brutal war against Ukraine from its own people. More than 15,000 citizens of Russia have been detained for taking part in anti-war protests since February 24. Russia’s communications authority has blocked access to nearly all independent news outlets and several social media platforms, and threatened journalists and average citizens alike with jail time if they dare to discuss the war against Ukraine using anything other than Kremlin-approved euphemisms.</p>
<p>We urge the Russian Federation to immediately and unconditionally release Aleksey Navalny and to end its campaign against his organizations and associates. Navalny’s case is sadly one of many the Kremlin continues to brazenly pursue as it systematically ignores the constitutional rights of the Russian people and its international commitments to respect and ensure human rights and fundamental freedoms. Now more than ever, the people of Russia must be able to hear voices of courage and integrity that tell the truth about the Kremlin’s wrongdoing at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Our partnership with, and commitment to, the people of Ukraine is steadfast and enduring. To that end, the Department of State has coordinated with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital to provide necessary life-saving and immediate care to four Ukrainian children whose ongoing cancer treatment was disrupted by President Putin’s war of choice. The Department supported airlift of these pediatric oncology patients and some of their immediate family members from Poland to Memphis International Airport, where they were met and transported to St. Jude. There, the patients will be able to safely resume critical cancer therapy disrupted by the Kremlin’s aggression. They will receive the specialized care they desperately need, and their family members will be afforded sustenance, security, and support from St. Jude.</p>
<p>Children are among the most vulnerable in a crisis, and these pediatric oncology patients need urgent and highly specialized medical care. We are proud to stand with European partners who are also treating children whose life-saving care in Ukraine has been made impossible by Putin’s war. We recognize, however, that the children transported represent a small proportion of the thousands of patients whose cancer treatment has been interrupted and, who, even amid a pandemic and with compromised immune systems, were forced to flee their homes. That is why, together with our allies and partners, we will continue to support our Ukrainian partners as we seek to save lives and bring this needless war to a close.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Water is one of the world’s most precious resources. Whether mitigating and adapting to climate change impacts, strengthening global health security, improving access to food, or securing energy resources, water is essential to addressing these issues and building a better future. Millions of people around the world lack access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and water supplies are increasingly scarce and unpredictable. And, of course, water is vital to all life on earth and to the conservation and restoration of nature. We must act to strengthen water security for all.</p>
<p>Many of our goals – and those of our partners – cannot be achieved without water security. The United States is investing in water resources and infrastructure at home and abroad through the U.S. Global Water Strategy, a whole-of-government approach to advance our vision for a water-secure world. We are also integrating water security and water management into our climate adaptation efforts. Through our commitment to conserve 30 percent of our land and waters by 2030, we will help maintain the ecosystems that are so crucial for water security. Additionally, the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE) will support climate adaptation efforts for more than half a billion people around the world. Investing in adaptation addresses immediate water challenges and builds a resilient future.</p>
<p>On this World Water Day, we recognize that our future depends on protecting this essential resource, and we celebrate everyone who is working to build a more water-secure world.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke yesterday with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian about ongoing efforts by NATO Allies and EU partners to provide vital security assistance and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.  The Secretary condemned President Putin’s increasingly brutal tactics that continue to kill civilians in this unjustified and unprovoked war of choice.  They discussed further economic and diplomatic measures to hold the Russian Federation and Belarus accountable.  They also discussed this week’s Extraordinary NATO Summit and the strengthening of Allied Defenses on the eastern flank.</p>
