					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>On June 25, 2021, the United States Department of State released the 2021 Fiscal Transparency Report, which found that 74 of the 141 governments reviewed by the Department met minimum requirements of fiscal transparency.  Seventeen of the 67 governments that did not meet minimum requirements made significant progress during the review period.</p>
<p>Fiscal transparency is a critical element of effective public financial management, helps build private market confidence, and underpins economic sustainability.  It fosters greater government accountability by providing a window into government budgets for citizens, helping citizens hold their leadership accountable, and facilitating better-informed public debate.  These Congressionally-mandated annual fiscal transparency reviews provide opportunities to engage in dialogue with governments on the importance of fiscal transparency, particularly important given the need for significant economic, health, and social spending to offset the shocks of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The report describes the minimum requirements of fiscal transparency, reviews 141 governments, most of which were identified as recipients of U.S. assistance in the 2014 Fiscal Transparency Report, and further assesses governments that did not meet the minimum fiscal transparency requirements during the review period of January 1 – December 31, 2020.  The report also indicates whether governments that did not meet those requirements made significant progress to publicly disclose national budget documentation, contracts, and licenses during the review period.  The Department of State evaluated the public availability, substantial completeness, and reliability of budget documents, as well as the transparency of processes for awarding government contracts and licenses.  Beginning with this review period, if a government has a sovereign wealth fund, it must disclose its source of funding and general approach to withdrawals from the fund.  Additionally, debt of all major state-owned enterprises must now be disclosed, and the government must have a supreme audit institution that meets international standards of independence and has verified the government’s annual financial statements.</p>
<p>The report can be found on the Department’s website at <a href="https://www.state.gov/fiscal-transparency-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTA2MjUuNDI0MTEwNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF0ZS5nb3YvZmlzY2FsLXRyYW5zcGFyZW5jeS1yZXBvcnQifQ.WK5ImjVnKy50J-ygHuQUAyr0k6OkiiPwhFiB1hee-2Q/s/1039202793/br/108439705831-l&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624719354905000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFfkAcLw6QqnBCf_KUiSrR7jjjLiw">https://www.state.gov/fiscal-<wbr />transparency-report</a>.  For further information, please contact the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs’ Fiscal Transparency team at <a href="mailto:fiscaltransparency@state.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiscaltransparency@state.gov</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Democracy flourishes when institutions of governance are inclusive, transparent, accountable, and responsive to its people. With that immutable fact in mind, the United States commends those Ethiopians who exercised their right to vote on June 21.</p>
<p>Elections, however, are not in and of themselves a sufficient marker of democracy or genuine political reform. The June 21 elections in Ethiopia took place against a backdrop of grave instability, including increasing inter-ethnic and inter-communal conflicts, and an electoral process that was not free or fair for all Ethiopians. The boycott of the elections by opposition parties, the detention of vocal political leaders, and the ongoing violence in multiple parts of the country underscore the need to launch an inclusive effort to build a national consensus on the governance of Ethiopia that preserves the sovereignty and unity of the state and strengthens the constitutional order.</p>
<p>In this period following the election, it is critical that Ethiopians come together to confront growing divisions. We urge politicians and community leaders to reject violence and refrain from inciting others to violence. The United States stands ready to assist Ethiopians to advance post-election dialogue, resolution of conflicts, and national reconciliation in Ethiopia. The ongoing conflict, violence, and likely famine declaration in Tigray demand urgent action, including a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Eritrean forces from Ethiopian territory, the transparent investigation of atrocities, and unhindered humanitarian access to populations in need.</p>
<p>We look forward to a continued partnership with the Ethiopian people and to supporting efforts to promote inclusive political participation that moves the country forward on a path to democracy and national unity.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is pleased to highlight that the Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean will enter into force June 25, 2021.  This is the first multilateral agreement of its kind to take a legally binding, precautionary approach to protect an area from commercial fishing before such fishing has begun.</p>
<p>There are currently no commercial fisheries in the Arctic high seas, with most of the region covered by ice year-round.  However, with an ever-increasing ice-free area in the summer, commercial fishing may be possible in the foreseeable future.  The Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean aims to manage potential fishing in the high seas of this region.</p>
<p>The United States led the negotiation of the Agreement, which was signed in Greenland on October 3, 2018.  There were ten participants in the negotiation of and Signatories to the Agreement: Canada, the People’s Republic of China, the Kingdom of Denmark (in respect of the Faroe Islands and Greenland), the European Union, Iceland, Japan, the Kingdom of Norway, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America.  The Agreement has two principal objectives: the prevention of unregulated fishing in the high seas portion of the central Arctic Ocean and the facilitation of joint scientific research and monitoring.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>Berlin Marriott Hotel</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Let me start with a more general question about the German-American relations.  I think as much as European and German officials appreciate U.S. being back on the world stage and re-engaging in multilateralism, there is the fear that the Biden administration might be only a brief return to normal before Trump or a Trumpian figure will take over the White House in ’25.  And my question is:  Do you share the concern that the U.S. democracy is still in a fragile condition, and Europe should therefore try to stand on its own feet?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I think we all have to deal with the here and now and the challenges that we’re facing together to try to deal with the – both the problems and opportunities that our citizens are facing around the world.  And what I’ve seen in just the last few months as we’ve been working closely with Germany, with other allies and partners, is that we’re producing meaningful results for our own people and for people around the world.  And ultimately, that’s what matters.  If we continue to do that, if we demonstrate that our democracies can deliver effectively for people, then I think the approach that we’re taking will be sustained.  So our obligation is to actually deliver results.</p>
<p>What we’ve seen, I think, working together – the G7, the NATO summit, the U.S.-EU summit – is exactly that.  Whether it was at the G7, our commitments together to deliver a billion doses of the COVID vaccine with more on top of that; the commitment to stop financing coal-fired plants so that we can really get at climate change – it’s the single biggest source of emissions; the program to, as we call it, Build Back Better for the World, investments we’re making together in infrastructure in low and mid-income countries with a race to the top in terms of the standards of investment; the work that we did at the U.S.-EU summit to end or at least put on pause trade disputes that had been lingering for years – in the case of Airbus and Boeing for 17 years – the steel tariffs.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Working together on trade and technology, setting standards, setting norms.  All of these things are concrete manifestations of the proposition that we not only can, we have to work together to deal with the challenges that are actually having an impact on the lives of our people.  And again, if we do that, if we show success, I think people will sustain that approach to policy and to international collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Let me ask you one question.  I mean, obviously, the most difficult issue at the moment between Washington and Berlin is the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.  You made it abundantly clear that President Biden opposes the project, and yet his administration waived sanction for the Nord Stream company and its CEO, Matthias Warnig.</p>
<p>And my question is:  Wasn’t that a huge mistake given the fact that Aleksey Navalny is still in prison, a court in Moscow banned Navalny’s anti-corruption organization, and just two weeks ago at an economic forum in Petersburg, Vladimir Putin made it perfectly clear that he is willing to use Nord Stream as a political weapon against Ukraine?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  First, as you know, the pipeline began construction in 2018.  By the time we took office in January of this year, it was more than 90 percent complete – the physical construction of the pipeline – and as we went ahead and sanctioned more entities under our law than had ever been sanctioned before.  But the reality of the physical completion of the pipeline was such that we looked to see:  Can we make something out of a very bad hand that we inherited?  Because yes, President Biden has long said that the pipeline is a bad idea, that it will potentially be a tool of Russian economic coercion and strategic coercion, a tool that can be used not only against Ukraine but indeed Europe as a whole to the extent it increases dependence on Russian gas.</p>
<p>But the question before us is what to actually do about this to mitigate or prevent the damage that the pipeline could do if used in the wrong way by President Putin and by Russia, and that’s exactly the conversation we’re now engaged in with Germany.  And I think it’s going to be very important to show by concrete actions that we’ll agree on together and potentially with others that we can prevent or mitigate damage that could be done by the pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And I mean, obviously, you are paying a big political price for not imposing sanctions to Nord Stream 2.  I mean, you know the situation in Congress.  What do you expect from the German Government in return?  Could a moratorium be a compromise between Germany and the U.S. where the construction is finished but the pipeline would only be put into operation under certain circumstances – for example, the release of Aleksey Navalny?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We’re in very active discussions with the German Government right now looking at a series of possible steps, actions, measures that we can take to make sure that the pipeline is not used for negative purposes as a tool of coercion or blackmail and that the interests of countries like Ukraine are protected both economically and strategically.  So there are a series of very practical things that we’re looking at, that we’re talking about, and my expectation is that we’ll agree on important measures that, again, can mitigate the – any damage that could be done.</p>
<p>The sanctions that we’ve – that we waived, those waivers can be rescinded.  We have to report again to our Congress in about a month’s time.  So I hope and expect that we’ll show real results from these conversations.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah, and one more question about Ukraine.  When one looks at the Ukraine crisis, it is very clear that the Normandy format talks that started in 2014 and include France, Germany and Ukraine and Russia, brought little to no progress at all.  And my question is:  Was it a mistake on President Obama’s part to leave the conflict basically to the Europeans?  And isn’t it – and is it now time for the U.S. to play a more active role perhaps in joining the Normandy format talks?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We were very engaged – the United States was very engaged in Ukraine in 2015, 2016.  We respected the proposition that the Normandy format would be the central vehicle for trying to advance the Minsk process, the agreements that were reached, which unfortunately have largely not been implemented by Russia over many years, but that that was the best way forward.  But we were working as well to try to advance that process.</p>
<p>President Biden discussed this with President Putin, and of course, he’s discussed it with Chancellor Merkel, with President Macron and others.  And what we’ve said is, look, if Russia is serious about implementing Minsk and we can be helpful, we’re fully prepared to do that.  But it really starts with the basic question of whether Russia is serious about it or not, or whether it prefers this frozen conflict where it can turn up the heat whenever it feels like it, as it did recently by massing the largest number of troops on Ukraine’s border since 2014.  So the real test is whether Russia is serious or not.</p>
<p>Irrespective of that, we’re committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty, its territorial integrity, its independence, and making sure that it has the means to defend itself from Russian aggression as well as supporting its efforts to deal with the internal aggression posed by corruption and other democratic deficiencies.  So we’re there for Ukraine.  My hope would be that Russia would actually be serious about the Minsk process.  In that case, I think, Normandy can continue to play a central role, but we’re also prepared to be engaged and to try to move it forward, but the question is really with Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yeah.  Do you think about naming a special envoy for Ukraine?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Look, we will look to see how we can best be helpful, if there is actual work to be done, and whether that’s through an envoy, whether that’s through the very experienced and very senior team that we’re putting together, including people who have deep experience with Ukraine.  For example, we – our Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, one of our most senior officials, Victoria Nuland, is someone who has deep experience in Ukraine.  Our incoming Assistant Secretary of State for Europe when approved by Congress is also someone with deep experience.  So how we do it matters less than whether there’s an opportunity to really move – help move something forward and do it in very close collaboration with Germany, with France, with our partners.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Rene, we have time for a final question.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Maybe one last question about the travel ban.  As a couple of days ago, American citizens are allowed to travel to Europe, but U.S. travel ban for citizens who want to travel to the U.S. is still in place.  Can you give us a timeline of when the ban will be lifted and what is the reason why European citizens who are vaccinated are not allowed to travel to the U.S.?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>We’re following the science and following the recommendations of our health authorities, principally the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control.  And that’s where we’re looking for guidance.  That’s where we’re looking for the best information possible upon which to make policy decisions.  We’re very anxious to have travel resume as robustly, as completely, as possible.  We have a working group with the European Union right now on this.  I can’t put a date on it.  I can tell you we’re working very, very actively on it, because we would like nothing better than to see travel pick up.  We have to all be deliberate about it and, again, make these decisions based on our best assessment of the science, our best assessment of health conditions.  That’s what we’re doing, but we’re doing it with the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Okay.  If you have time, one last question about China.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Go ahead.  One last one and &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Just before the Biden administration took over in January 20th, the EU and China agreed on a trade deal that should create new investment opportunities for EU companies in China.  Did you consider that as an unfriendly gesture on part of the EU?  Do you now expect Germany and the EU to take a tougher stance on China?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, what we’re focused on is not trying to contain China or to hold China back.  We’re focused on trying to hold up the free and open, rules-based international system that the United States and Germany together have helped to build and we’ve invested so much in over so many decades.  And if different aspects of that free and open rules-based system are being challenged by anyone, whether it’s China or any other country, then we think it’s important to stand up and defend what we built, because it’s delivered very important results for all of our citizens and can continue to do so.  So that’s the basic approach.  We also recognize that we all have very complicated relationships with China that can’t be summed up in one word or, as we like to say, on a bumper sticker of a car.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>There are adversarial aspects, competitive ones, cooperative ones.  But whether it’s any of those three, our proposition is we’re much better off engaging China together.  We’re going to be much more effective in any of those areas if we’re doing it together.  So that’s what we’re looking towards.  We want to make sure that in any of our engagements with China that we’re upholding the basic norms and standards that bring us together, that we’re – if we’re in a race, it’s a race to the top, not a race to the bottom.  And that goes for the commercial relationship, that goes for the relationship on political and diplomatic issues, and so on.</p>
<p>So when it comes to something like the agreement that was reached, no, the question is not a hostile action.  We just want to make sure that we all have in mind some of the potential challenges that China poses, for example, when it comes to information technology that is so significant in all of our lives.  Unfortunately, if you’re doing business with a so-called private company from China, there is actually no distinction between private and the government.  The government has the ability to control and to elicit information from any of these companies.  And unfortunately, right now when it comes to norms and standards of human rights, of privacy, of intellectual property, the government in Beijing does not meet the standards that we’ve all set.  So I think we have to be careful.  So that’s all that we’re saying.</p>
<p>But what I think we’ve seen especially – just look at the last two weeks.  We’re seeing a convergence of views on the best ways to engage China.  The G7 summit – the last time the G7 leaders met in 2018, China was not even mentioned in the communique.  In this case, there were, I think, important things agreed to by the leaders when it comes to dealing with China.  Similarly at NATO just a couple of days later, the last time that NATO wrote a strategic concept back in 2010, China was not mentioned.  There’s focus on China in NATO as well.  And when we got to the U.S.-EU summit, we’ve agreed to establish between the United States and the EU a trade and technology council that’s going to make sure that when it comes to trade and technology, we’re working together on the norms, on the standards, on the rules in ways that reflect our values.  We re-established the U.S.-EU dialogue on China that had been dormant.</p>
<p>So what I’m seeing increasingly is a shared viewpoint but one that recognizes the complexity of the relationships, the fact that they’re consequential for all of us.  And we’re not asking people to choose between the United States and China.  We’re simply saying we have a common set of values and interests that have helped shape the international system for almost eight decades, and we need to continue to stand for freedom and for openness when it comes to that system and to do it together.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>So thank you so much for your time, Mr. Secretary, and I hope I see you in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you.  See you Washington.  Thank you.  Good to be with you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>Berlin Marriott Hotel</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Let me start with a more general question about the German-American relations.  I think as much as European and German officials appreciate U.S. being back on the world stage and re-engaging in multilateralism, there is the fear that the Biden administration might be only a brief return to normal before Trump or a Trumpian figure will take over the White House in ’25.  And my question is:  Do you share the concern that the U.S. democracy is still in a fragile condition, and Europe should therefore try to stand on its own feet?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I think we all have to deal with the here and now and the challenges that we’re facing together to try to deal with the – both the problems and opportunities that our citizens are facing around the world.  And what I’ve seen in just the last few months as we’ve been working closely with Germany, with other allies and partners, is that we’re producing meaningful results for our own people and for people around the world.  And ultimately, that’s what matters.  If we continue to do that, if we demonstrate that our democracies can deliver effectively for people, then I think the approach that we’re taking will be sustained.  So our obligation is to actually deliver results.</p>
<p>What we’ve seen, I think, working together – the G7, the NATO summit, the U.S.-EU summit – is exactly that.  Whether it was at the G7, our commitments together to deliver a billion doses of the COVID vaccine with more on top of that; the commitment to stop financing coal-fired plants so that we can really get at climate change – it’s the single biggest source of emissions; the program to, as we call it, Build Back Better for the World, investments we’re making together in infrastructure in low and mid-income countries with a race to the top in terms of the standards of investment; the work that we did at the U.S.-EU summit to end or at least put on pause trade disputes that had been lingering for years – in the case of Airbus and Boeing for 17 years – the steel tariffs.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Working together on trade and technology, setting standards, setting norms.  All of these things are concrete manifestations of the proposition that we not only can, we have to work together to deal with the challenges that are actually having an impact on the lives of our people.  And again, if we do that, if we show success, I think people will sustain that approach to policy and to international collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Let me ask you one question.  I mean, obviously, the most difficult issue at the moment between Washington and Berlin is the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.  You made it abundantly clear that President Biden opposes the project, and yet his administration waived sanction for the Nord Stream company and its CEO, Matthias Warnig.</p>
<p>And my question is:  Wasn’t that a huge mistake given the fact that Aleksey Navalny is still in prison, a court in Moscow banned Navalny’s anti-corruption organization, and just two weeks ago at an economic forum in Petersburg, Vladimir Putin made it perfectly clear that he is willing to use Nord Stream as a political weapon against Ukraine?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  First, as you know, the pipeline began construction in 2018.  By the time we took office in January of this year, it was more than 90 percent complete – the physical construction of the pipeline – and as we went ahead and sanctioned more entities under our law than had ever been sanctioned before.  But the reality of the physical completion of the pipeline was such that we looked to see:  Can we make something out of a very bad hand that we inherited?  Because yes, President Biden has long said that the pipeline is a bad idea, that it will potentially be a tool of Russian economic coercion and strategic coercion, a tool that can be used not only against Ukraine but indeed Europe as a whole to the extent it increases dependence on Russian gas.</p>
<p>But the question before us is what to actually do about this to mitigate or prevent the damage that the pipeline could do if used in the wrong way by President Putin and by Russia, and that’s exactly the conversation we’re now engaged in with Germany.  And I think it’s going to be very important to show by concrete actions that we’ll agree on together and potentially with others that we can prevent or mitigate damage that could be done by the pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And I mean, obviously, you are paying a big political price for not imposing sanctions to Nord Stream 2.  I mean, you know the situation in Congress.  What do you expect from the German Government in return?  Could a moratorium be a compromise between Germany and the U.S. where the construction is finished but the pipeline would only be put into operation under certain circumstances – for example, the release of Aleksey Navalny?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We’re in very active discussions with the German Government right now looking at a series of possible steps, actions, measures that we can take to make sure that the pipeline is not used for negative purposes as a tool of coercion or blackmail and that the interests of countries like Ukraine are protected both economically and strategically.  So there are a series of very practical things that we’re looking at, that we’re talking about, and my expectation is that we’ll agree on important measures that, again, can mitigate the – any damage that could be done.</p>
<p>The sanctions that we’ve – that we waived, those waivers can be rescinded.  We have to report again to our Congress in about a month’s time.  So I hope and expect that we’ll show real results from these conversations.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah, and one more question about Ukraine.  When one looks at the Ukraine crisis, it is very clear that the Normandy format talks that started in 2014 and include France, Germany and Ukraine and Russia, brought little to no progress at all.  And my question is:  Was it a mistake on President Obama’s part to leave the conflict basically to the Europeans?  And isn’t it – and is it now time for the U.S. to play a more active role perhaps in joining the Normandy format talks?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We were very engaged – the United States was very engaged in Ukraine in 2015, 2016.  We respected the proposition that the Normandy format would be the central vehicle for trying to advance the Minsk process, the agreements that were reached, which unfortunately have largely not been implemented by Russia over many years, but that that was the best way forward.  But we were working as well to try to advance that process.</p>
<p>President Biden discussed this with President Putin, and of course, he’s discussed it with Chancellor Merkel, with President Macron and others.  And what we’ve said is, look, if Russia is serious about implementing Minsk and we can be helpful, we’re fully prepared to do that.  But it really starts with the basic question of whether Russia is serious about it or not, or whether it prefers this frozen conflict where it can turn up the heat whenever it feels like it, as it did recently by massing the largest number of troops on Ukraine’s border since 2014.  So the real test is whether Russia is serious or not.</p>
<p>Irrespective of that, we’re committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty, its territorial integrity, its independence, and making sure that it has the means to defend itself from Russian aggression as well as supporting its efforts to deal with the internal aggression posed by corruption and other democratic deficiencies.  So we’re there for Ukraine.  My hope would be that Russia would actually be serious about the Minsk process.  In that case, I think, Normandy can continue to play a central role, but we’re also prepared to be engaged and to try to move it forward, but the question is really with Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yeah.  Do you think about naming a special envoy for Ukraine?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Look, we will look to see how we can best be helpful, if there is actual work to be done, and whether that’s through an envoy, whether that’s through the very experienced and very senior team that we’re putting together, including people who have deep experience with Ukraine.  For example, we – our Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, one of our most senior officials, Victoria Nuland, is someone who has deep experience in Ukraine.  Our incoming Assistant Secretary of State for Europe when approved by Congress is also someone with deep experience.  So how we do it matters less than whether there’s an opportunity to really move – help move something forward and do it in very close collaboration with Germany, with France, with our partners.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Rene, we have time for a final question.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Maybe one last question about the travel ban.  As a couple of days ago, American citizens are allowed to travel to Europe, but U.S. travel ban for citizens who want to travel to the U.S. is still in place.  Can you give us a timeline of when the ban will be lifted and what is the reason why European citizens who are vaccinated are not allowed to travel to the U.S.?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>We’re following the science and following the recommendations of our health authorities, principally the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control.  And that’s where we’re looking for guidance.  That’s where we’re looking for the best information possible upon which to make policy decisions.  We’re very anxious to have travel resume as robustly, as completely, as possible.  We have a working group with the European Union right now on this.  I can’t put a date on it.  I can tell you we’re working very, very actively on it, because we would like nothing better than to see travel pick up.  We have to all be deliberate about it and, again, make these decisions based on our best assessment of the science, our best assessment of health conditions.  That’s what we’re doing, but we’re doing it with the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Okay.  If you have time, one last question about China.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Go ahead.  One last one and &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Just before the Biden administration took over in January 20th, the EU and China agreed on a trade deal that should create new investment opportunities for EU companies in China.  Did you consider that as an unfriendly gesture on part of the EU?  Do you now expect Germany and the EU to take a tougher stance on China?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Well, what we’re focused on is not trying to contain China or to hold China back.  We’re focused on trying to hold up the free and open, rules-based international system that the United States and Germany together have helped to build and we’ve invested so much in over so many decades.  And if different aspects of that free and open rules-based system are being challenged by anyone, whether it’s China or any other country, then we think it’s important to stand up and defend what we built, because it’s delivered very important results for all of our citizens and can continue to do so.  So that’s the basic approach.  We also recognize that we all have very complicated relationships with China that can’t be summed up in one word or, as we like to say, on a bumper sticker of a car.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>So thank you so much for your time, Mr. Secretary, and I hope I see you in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you.  See you Washington.  Thank you.  Good to be with you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Jalina Porter, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:06 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Good afternoon, and thank you for joining today’s daily press briefing.  I have three updates at the top before I start taking your questions.</p>
<p>As you know, the Secretary arrived in Berlin yesterday for a multi-leg European trip that would also take him to Paris, Rome, Bari and Matera.  This trip gives the Secretary a chance to follow up on the President’s successful trip to the region last week and continued discussions with key partners to underscore the U.S. commitment to a strong transatlantic partnership.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Secretary met with Chancellor Merkel and Foreign Minister Maas to discuss how we can further strengthen the U.S.-Germany relationship to address common challenges, including recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, as well as China and Russia.  The Secretary also participated in the second Berlin conference on Libya which was an opportunity for the international community to support the progress made by the Libyan people and underscore our support for the full implementation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the October 2020 nationwide ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>Today, the Secretary and Foreign Minister Maas launched the initial meeting of the U.S.-Germany Dialogue on the Holocaust to highlight our shared commitment to combating anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial and distortion and to find innovative new ways to enhance Holocaust education.  The leaders used this opportunity to emphasize how anti-Semitism is rising around the world and such hatred and prejudice are inimical to U.S. and transatlantic interests and values.</p>
<p>The Secretary departs this evening for Paris where he will continue his discussion with European leaders.</p>
<p>Next, I am pleased to announce that 3 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine will arrive in Campinas, Brazil tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>This donation is a part of 80 million doses that President Biden announced on May 17th and is the result of close collaboration between the governments of the United States and Brazil toward putting an end to this pandemic.</p>
<p>As President Biden has said, the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts as we have demonstrated right here at home.</p>
<p>We are sharing these vaccines to save lives and to lead the world into bringing an end to this pandemic.</p>
<p>We’re working to get as many safe and effective vaccine doses to as many people around the world as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks to the innovation of U.S. companies and the resilience of and commitment of American people, we&#8217;re in a position to help others.</p>
<p>The United States congratulates law professor Gay McDougall on her election as an independent expert on the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination or CERD.  Given her extensive legal and international human rights experience, including two previous terms on the Committee, the United States considers Professor McDougall a highly qualified expert who has made and who will continue to make valuable contributions to the Committee.</p>
<p>Racial justice is at the forefront of our international engagements, as demonstrated by our engagement at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) 46th session where we led a statement addressing systemic racism signed by 158 nations, our nomination of Professor McDougall to the CERD, and submitting overdue report on the CERD on June 2nd.</p>
<p>The United States will continue to engage the international community to find effective means to address systemic racism both at home and around the world.</p>
<p>And finally, leaders from 16 Southern African Development Community nations held a summit in Mozambique Wednesday June 23rd, 2021.  We applaud the Southern African Development Community’s focus on the threat of terrorism in Mozambique, as ISIS is not an isolated problem but rather a regional – a broader regional concern.</p>
<p>The United States is also committed to supporting the Government of Mozambique to counter terrorism and combat violent extremism with a holistic strategy that also includes socio-economic development, community resilience programs, and security assistance, as well as humanitarian aid.  We look forward to learning more of the South African Development Communities – Development Community, excuse me, plan coming out of the summit, and we will underscore the importance of keeping civilian protection and respect for human rights at the forefront of all security assistance.</p>
<p>Let’s go to the line of Jiha Ham.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Jiha, your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  Hi, Jalina.  I have a question related to Otto Warmbier, the University of Virginia student who was tortured by North Korea and later sent back home, but died in 2017.  New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and the council members of the city have been endorsing a bill that can change the name of their – one of their streets to Otto Warmbier Way to commemorate Otto Warmbier.  And the street that they want to rename is located right in front of the New York North Korean mission to the UN.  So I’m wondering if you support this idea or whether you have any concerns as the host country of the foreign missions to the UN.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Well, I’ll start off by saying that we certainly will continue to express our deepest condolences to the Warmbier family.  With respect to your question on the street naming and where specifically it is in New York City, I’d have to refer you back to the mayor of New York City and all the local officials in New York City for those specific decisions being made.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Said Arikat, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello?  Yeah.  Thank you very kindly.  Very quickly, today Palestinian Authority security forces arrested a Palestinian activist and he died in custody.  I wonder if you have a position on this, because this really comes at the heels of many abuses by the Palestinian security forces against Palestinian activists.</p>
<p>And my second question is the fact that Senator Risch is holding $50 million in aid to the Palestinians that was approved by Congress.  Do you have – also have a comment on that?  Thank you, Jalina.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Thank you for your question, Said.  So I’m going to start with your second question first.  For that, we simply won’t comment on the holds, and for that I’d have to send you back to Senator Risch’s office for any specific commentary.</p>
<p>To your first question, I’ll just say that we’re deeply disturbed by the death of Palestinian activist Nizar Banat and the information that has been reported regarding the circumstances surrounding his death.  We certainly also offer our sincere condolences not only to his family but as well as the community who’s been impacted by his death.  We urge the Palestinian Authority to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation and to also ensure full accountability in this case.  And we also strongly encourage the Palestinian Authority to respect the rights to free expression as well as the work of civil society.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Jen Hansler.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  Thanks for doing this.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi.  Thank you.  On the SIV issue, I was wondering whether you could tell us anything about the role the State Department is playing in the planning for a potential evacuation to a third country.  Which countries are under consideration for relocating the SIV applicants?  And then is anyone from the State Department meeting with anybody from the Afghan delegation that is in D.C. right now?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  So to your second question, I don’t have anything to announce or report out.  But to your first question, we are identifying SIV applicants who have served as interpreters as well as translators to be relocated outside of Afghanistan before we complete our military drawdown by September, in order to safely complete the remainder of the Special Immigrant Visa application process.  These are individuals who are actually already in the SIV pipeline.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Abigail Williams.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks so much, Jalina.  Following up on Jenny’s question regarding SIVs, I wanted to ask if you have any updated numbers on where you are in the process at looking at the 18,000 applicants.  I know that Secretary Blinken had spoken of 9,000 being towards the beginning process and another 9,000 waiting and face delays.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  No, I don’t have any specific updates in regards to numbers, but just will continue to underscore that we have said that we’re committed to supporting those who’ve helped the military as well as other government personnel with their duties, of course often at great personal risk, not only to themselves but to their family members.  And we’re continuing to work on every way possible to make sure we can help those who have helped us.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Oskar Gorzynski.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Yes, I can hear you.  Did I say your name correctly?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah.  Yeah, that’s pretty much right, as good as it gets.  So I wanted to ask about today’s meeting between German Minister of Economy Peter Altmaier and Secretary Kerry.  Do you have any information that – what are the topics?  And there have – relatedly, this week German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that he expects a deal with the U.S. on Nord Stream 2 by August.  Is that the State Department’s assessment as well, and what would such a deal include?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  I’ll take your second question first.  We have nothing to announce when it comes to any specific deadlines, but we’ll continue to underscore that the President has made rebuilding our relationship with our allies – and of course that would include Germany administration priority – the strength of these relationships will lay the foundation for many of our foreign policy priorities, such as economic recovery, recovery in combating COVID-19, as well as pushing back on the PRC and authoritarianism around the world.</p>
<p>To your first question, we don’t have anything to announce.  We’ll have to take that back and get back to you on the meeting you mentioned with Secretary Kerry.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Nick Wadhams.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi.  Thanks very much, Jalina.  Just to follow up on the Afghanistan question, do you have a sense for where you may send those folks who worked for the U.S. while they await processing their SIV visas?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  So thank you for your question, Nick.  I don’t have anything to share about specific locations at this time, but I will say that we would take under any relocation in full compliance with all the applicable laws as well as in full coordination with Congress.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Jose Luis Sanz.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi.  So Jalina, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah, well a couple of questions about Central America.  First one is about Nicaragua.  The fact that the repression and the detention of opposition leaders or journalists has continued means that the sanctions and the international community and the United States strategy is not working, and how do you expect to continue trying to help to (inaudible) on transpiring election in Nicaragua.</p>
<p>And the second one is about the request to El Salvador for the extradition of MS-13 members.  Can you confirm how many of them has been – already been made by the United States?  I’m talking about the case that is being seen in New York.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  So to your second question about MS-13 members and El Salvador, I’ll have to refer you to the Department of Justice.  And to your first question about Nicaragua, what I’ll say largely speaking is that, of course, the courage of the Nicaraguan people is admirable.  And we will continue to support them in the United States.  We’ll also continue to use all of our diplomatic and economic tools at our disposal to support Nicaraguans’ call for greater freedoms as well as accountability.  And of course, that would also include free and fair elections.</p>
<p>Thank you for your questions.  That’s all we have time for today, and I hope you have a great week ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:24 p.m.)</p>

<p>The Secretary departs this evening for Paris where he will continue his discussion with European leaders.</p>
<p>Next, I am pleased to announce that 3 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine will arrive in Campinas, Brazil tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>This donation is a part of 80 million doses that President Biden announced on May 17th and is the result of close collaboration between the governments of the United States and Brazil toward putting an end to this pandemic.</p>
<p>As President Biden has said, the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts as we have demonstrated right here at home.</p>
<p>We are sharing these vaccines to save lives and to lead the world into bringing an end to this pandemic.</p>
<p>We’re working to get as many safe and effective vaccine doses to as many people around the world as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks to the innovation of U.S. companies and the resilience of and commitment of American people, we&#8217;re in a position to help others.</p>
<p>The United States congratulates law professor Gay McDougall on her election as an independent expert on the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination or CERD.  Given her extensive legal and international human rights experience, including two previous terms on the Committee, the United States considers Professor McDougall a highly qualified expert who has made and who will continue to make valuable contributions to the Committee.</p>
<p>Racial justice is at the forefront of our international engagements, as demonstrated by our engagement at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) 46th session where we led a statement addressing systemic racism signed by 158 nations, our nomination of Professor McDougall to the CERD, and submitting overdue report on the CERD on June 2nd.</p>
<p>The United States will continue to engage the international community to find effective means to address systemic racism both at home and around the world.</p>
<p>And finally, leaders from 16 Southern African Development Community nations held a summit in Mozambique Wednesday June 23rd, 2021.  We applaud the Southern African Development Community’s focus on the threat of terrorism in Mozambique, as ISIS is not an isolated problem but rather a regional – a broader regional concern.</p>
<p>The United States is also committed to supporting the Government of Mozambique to counter terrorism and combat violent extremism with a holistic strategy that also includes socio-economic development, community resilience programs, and security assistance, as well as humanitarian aid.  We look forward to learning more of the South African Development Communities – Development Community, excuse me, plan coming out of the summit, and we will underscore the importance of keeping civilian protection and respect for human rights at the forefront of all security assistance.</p>
<p>Let’s go to the line of Jiha Ham.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  Jiha, your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  Hi, Jalina.  I have a question related to Otto Warmbier, the University of Virginia student who was tortured by North Korea and later sent back home, but died in 2017.  New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and the council members of the city have been endorsing a bill that can change the name of their – one of their streets to Otto Warmbier Way to commemorate Otto Warmbier.  And the street that they want to rename is located right in front of the New York North Korean mission to the UN.  So I’m wondering if you support this idea or whether you have any concerns as the host country of the foreign missions to the UN.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Well, I’ll start off by saying that we certainly will continue to express our deepest condolences to the Warmbier family.  With respect to your question on the street naming and where specifically it is in New York City, I’d have to refer you back to the mayor of New York City and all the local officials in New York City for those specific decisions being made.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Said Arikat, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello?  Yeah.  Thank you very kindly.  Very quickly, today Palestinian Authority security forces arrested a Palestinian activist and he died in custody.  I wonder if you have a position on this, because this really comes at the heels of many abuses by the Palestinian security forces against Palestinian activists.</p>
<p>And my second question is the fact that Senator Risch is holding $50 million in aid to the Palestinians that was approved by Congress.  Do you have – also have a comment on that?  Thank you, Jalina.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Thank you for your question, Said.  So I’m going to start with your second question first.  For that, we simply won’t comment on the holds, and for that I’d have to send you back to Senator Risch’s office for any specific commentary.</p>
<p>To your first question, I’ll just say that we’re deeply disturbed by the death of Palestinian activist Nizar Banat and the information that has been reported regarding the circumstances surrounding his death.  We certainly also offer our sincere condolences not only to his family but as well as the community who’s been impacted by his death.  We urge the Palestinian Authority to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation and to also ensure full accountability in this case.  And we also strongly encourage the Palestinian Authority to respect the rights to free expression as well as the work of civil society.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Jen Hansler.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  Thanks for doing this.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi.  Thank you.  On the SIV issue, I was wondering whether you could tell us anything about the role the State Department is playing in the planning for a potential evacuation to a third country.  Which countries are under consideration for relocating the SIV applicants?  And then is anyone from the State Department meeting with anybody from the Afghan delegation that is in D.C. right now?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  So to your second question, I don’t have anything to announce or report out.  But to your first question, we are identifying SIV applicants who have served as interpreters as well as translators to be relocated outside of Afghanistan before we complete our military drawdown by September, in order to safely complete the remainder of the Special Immigrant Visa application process.  These are individuals who are actually already in the SIV pipeline.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Abigail Williams.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks so much, Jalina.  Following up on Jenny’s question regarding SIVs, I wanted to ask if you have any updated numbers on where you are in the process at looking at the 18,000 applicants.  I know that Secretary Blinken had spoken of 9,000 being towards the beginning process and another 9,000 waiting and face delays.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  No, I don’t have any specific updates in regards to numbers, but just will continue to underscore that we have said that we’re committed to supporting those who’ve helped the military as well as other government personnel with their duties, of course often at great personal risk, not only to themselves but to their family members.  And we’re continuing to work on every way possible to make sure we can help those who have helped us.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Oskar Gorzynski.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, Jalina.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Yes, I can hear you.  Did I say your name correctly?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah.  Yeah, that’s pretty much right, as good as it gets.  So I wanted to ask about today’s meeting between German Minister of Economy Peter Altmaier and Secretary Kerry.  Do you have any information that – what are the topics?  And there have – relatedly, this week German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that he expects a deal with the U.S. on Nord Stream 2 by August.  Is that the State Department’s assessment as well, and what would such a deal include?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  I’ll take your second question first.  We have nothing to announce when it comes to any specific deadlines, but we’ll continue to underscore that the President has made rebuilding our relationship with our allies – and of course that would include Germany administration priority – the strength of these relationships will lay the foundation for many of our foreign policy priorities, such as economic recovery, recovery in combating COVID-19, as well as pushing back on the PRC and authoritarianism around the world.</p>
<p>To your first question, we don’t have anything to announce.  We’ll have to take that back and get back to you on the meeting you mentioned with Secretary Kerry.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Nick Wadhams.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi.  Thanks very much, Jalina.  Just to follow up on the Afghanistan question, do you have a sense for where you may send those folks who worked for the U.S. while they await processing their SIV visas?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  So thank you for your question, Nick.  I don’t have anything to share about specific locations at this time, but I will say that we would take under any relocation in full compliance with all the applicable laws as well as in full coordination with Congress.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Jose Luis Sanz.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi.  So Jalina, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah, well a couple of questions about Central America.  First one is about Nicaragua.  The fact that the repression and the detention of opposition leaders or journalists has continued means that the sanctions and the international community and the United States strategy is not working, and how do you expect to continue trying to help to (inaudible) on transpiring election in Nicaragua.</p>
<p>And the second one is about the request to El Salvador for the extradition of MS-13 members.  Can you confirm how many of them has been – already been made by the United States?  I’m talking about the case that is being seen in New York.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong>  So to your second question about MS-13 members and El Salvador, I’ll have to refer you to the Department of Justice.  And to your first question about Nicaragua, what I’ll say largely speaking is that, of course, the courage of the Nicaraguan people is admirable.  And we will continue to support them in the United States.  We’ll also continue to use all of our diplomatic and economic tools at our disposal to support Nicaraguans’ call for greater freedoms as well as accountability.  And of course, that would also include free and fair elections.</p>
<p>Thank you for your questions.  That’s all we have time for today, and I hope you have a great week ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:24 p.m.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Thank you.  Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining our call.  We have with us today .   is going to address the current status of the situation following conclusion of the sixth round of talks.  Just as a reminder,  will be speaking today on background.  And you may refer to him as a Senior State Department Official for the purposes of your reporting.</p>
<p>Also as another reminder, this call is embargoed until the conclusion of the call.  And the audio from this session is not for broadcast or replay.  So just one more time, this on background to a Senior State Department Official.  And with that, I’m going to go ahead and turn it over to  for ’s remarks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thank you.  And thanks for doing this again.  I know that in the last few weeks there’s been some confusion, some reporting that may have been – that have added to that confusion.  And part of it could be because we haven’t done one of these some time, so I’m glad to do it again and try to clear up any confusion that may exist.  So I’ll be brief in what I’ll say at the top, just to try to address two issues that I think have caused some of that imprecision.</p>
<p>First, where we are on the talks – and there has been some reporting that we basically have a deal already with Iran, that it’s just a matter of deciding when we’re going to put it out.  Let me make it absolutely clear:  We just concluded round six.  We will be resuming – or coming back for round seven sometime in the not-too-distant future, and we wouldn’t be doing that if the deal were already done.  We still have serious differences that have not been bridged, serious differences with Iran over the host of issues, whether it’s the nuclear steps that Iran needs to take to come back into compliance, the sanctions relief that the U.S. will be offering, or the sequence of steps that both sides would be taking.  Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  And since everything is not agreed, we still don’t have anything nailed down.  And there’s still some very important issues that need to be resolved.  By the same token, we wouldn’t be going back for a seventh round if we didn’t think that a deal was possible.  It remains possible.  It remains our objective, but we’re not there yet, and I’m not going to speculate as to if or when we will get there.</p>
<p>Second point, as to the issue of timing and in particular the impact of the elections (inaudible), first I think we’ve said already what we thought of the elections and of the new president, the fact that this was a pre-manufactured process that did not reflect the will of the Iranian people.  And we also have said what we thought about the background of the president-elect.  That said, from our point of view, it does not affect our determination to try to reach a deal or the pace at which we will go about pursuing it.  We’re not going to second guess any effect that it might have on Iranian decision making, but our goal is to pursue the objective that President Biden laid out both during the campaign and since, which is to try to address – diplomatically by – is our preference – our goal of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>And we believe that diplomacy, by returning to the JCPOA, is the best way to achieve that goal, and we’ll do it with whoever is in power with Iran precisely because we have serious – very serious – differences with their leadership.  And we believe that preventing them from acquiring a nuclear weapon is an important step in then trying to address the other issues that we have with Iran.  Because again, as President Biden and the Secretary of State have made clear, we see the return to the JCPOA as a beginning of a diplomatic process, not at the end, because we have many other issues of concern that we need to raise from Iran’s (inaudible) groups in the region, to its ballistic missile program, to its many other destabilizing activities.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say a word about an issue which is as important as anything I’ve said already, which is the issue of American citizens who are wrongfully detained in Iran.  That I still need to raise this, that they’re still not home, is a scandal and one that we are fighting every day to address.  And for Ahmad, for Siamak, for Baquer, for Morad, this is our priority.  We will not rest until they’re home and we’ll do everything in our power to make sure that that the day comes very, very soon.</p>
<p>So with that, I’m happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Great.  Thank you.  Let’s please go to the line of Nick Wadhams.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment, please.  Wait until I announce your line is open before speaking.  And Nick, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Thanks very much.  , understanding that you have differences on sequencing, do you – can you give us a sense for how the oil waivers would fit into this, whether you would grant waivers on day one or hold out to issue waivers until later on, maybe two to three months after the IAEA confirms compliance?  And would you be willing to give waivers without an IAEA confirmation of compliance?  And then second, can you just comment on the idea that the clock is ticking here because if too much time goes on, Iran will advance so far technologically that the original terms of the JCPOA essentially become moot, and you would have to negotiate an entirely new deal?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>So thanks, Nick.  So as to the first question, this may apply to a number of questions we’re going to get.  However much we’d prefer to be negotiating with the press corps than with Iran, it’s not what we’re going to do, so I’d rather – I won’t get into the details of what our position is on various issues, so I’ll skip the first question.</p>
<p>The second one about the clock, listen, there’s no – it’s not like there’s a scientific time at which point that threshold that you mentioned will be crossed, but certainly time is not a positive factor.  And this process won’t be open indefinitely, so we’re trying to get back into the deal.  We understand Iran is continuing to make progress, which is precisely why we believe withdrawing from the deal was a mistake and why we’re faced with this situation.  We’re going to try to get them back as soon as possible under the terms of the deal.  If it’s not done quickly and if Iran continues to make progress, of course it’s something that we’re going to have to consider in terms of the provisions of the deal that we’d be prepared to accept.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Let’s go to the line of Lara Jakes.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment.  And Lara, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.  And Lara, please check your mute button.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yes.  I’m sorry.  I was, in fact, on mute.  Apologies.  Thanks.  And  a minute ago you said that we see the return to the JCPOA as the beginning of the process and not the end.  Iran’s new president has very clearly said that he will not consider a longer and stronger deal for reining in the missile’s programs and the proxies.  So I’m wondering why you think that delta can be resolved.  And I’m also wondering if you’d speak a little bit about the IAEA inspections agreement that is, I think, expiring today.  I believe there’s a tentative agreement for it to be extended again.  Is that a reason for optimism?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks, Lara.  So on the first point, yeah, we’ve heard what President-Elect Raisi said.  Frankly, that’s not very different from what other Iranian leaders have been saying for some time.  But we’ve been equally clear, crystal-clear, and President Biden was crystal-clear on this, from the campaign and from his first day in office, which is that we believe that we can – are going to need to discuss other issues after we – assuming we get back into the JCPOA.  There are many issues of concern that we have, but also there’s issues that Iran wants to address, and they’ve made that very clear to us, including during this talks, that they – there are some elements that they are asking for, which go beyond the terms of the JCPOA.  So our position remains the same, that we see the return to the JCPOA as a beginning of a diplomatic process, and we believe that we’re going to need to engage in discussions with Iran, various things to address those other issues.  So we’ll have to find a way to resolve that difference.</p>
<p>On the IAEA, it’s good that you mention it.  Obviously we are concerned that at – from the time that I’m speaking – maybe there’s been news since – in the last hour or so, but we have not heard that there’s been an understanding.  If one is reached, that would be positive.  Although, we shouldn’t be playing – Iran should not be playing brinkmanship each time these agreements get extended.  I’d simply say that in the absence of such an understanding, in the absence of the IAEA being able to monitor what Iran is doing, it will be that much more complicated to get back into the JCPOA, because we’re going to have to know what the baseline of their nuclear program is.  And if the IAEA is blind for a certain amount of time and we don’t know what that baseline is, it’s going to be much more difficult to find a way back into the deal.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Jennifer Hansler.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Jennifer, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, .  Thanks so much for doing this.  What are you telling the Iranians about guarantees that the U.S. won’t quit the deal in four years?  How are you assuaging their concerns on that?  And on the issue of the hostages, has there been any progress towards their release?  Is it still the case that their release is not a precondition for the U.S. re-entering the JCPOA?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks.  So, I mean, there is no such thing as a guarantee, and I think Iran knows it and we know it.  We have no guarantee; they have no guarantee.  That’s the way the JCPOA is built, that if one side violated, the other side would – its remedy would be to take countermanding steps.  But what we do think is that the best guarantee is to get back into the deal and to implement it faithfully, and that’s – and we think that there’s a – that’s the best answer, because there is no such thing as a guarantee.</p>
<p>Secondly, on the question of the detainees, it’s the same thing as I said about the deal.  Because nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, because we don’t have a deal yet, I’m not going to speak about how close we are.  Yet, we’ve made progress.  We were engaged in indirect discussions with Iran about their release, but we’re not there yet, and until we’re there I don&#8217;t want to give false hopes to the families who’ve suffered too much already.  And as I’ve said in the past, it is a priority, and we are absolutely insistent that the four American citizens who are wrongfully detained be released.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  And let’s go the line of Arshad Mohammed.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Arshad, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.  And Arshad, please check your mute button.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you, and sorry about mute.  Two things.  One, would you continue the negotiations if Iran fails to extend its agreement with the IAEA?  And secondly, you said this process will not be open indefinitely.  What happens if you cannot reach an agreement by August 3rd, the date on which the Raisi administration takes office?  Is that when the door closes?  Or is the door open?  It may be indefinite, but it could be open for months or even years?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks.  And I know that both two good but difficult questions.  We still hope that Iran will extend its technical understanding with the IAEA or find – not prolong the understandings that currently exist.  As I said, it would be an issue of real concern if they didn’t.  I’m not going to speculate as to what impact it would have on the talks, but I think it is – we’ve already indicated clearly to Iran that it would be extremely complicated if they – a complicating factor if they did not find a way to continue the understandings with the IAEA.</p>
<p>On your second question, again, I’m not going to sit here and say there’s a deadline.  Obviously this will be a decision for the President and his national security team to take.  But when we’ve said – and others have said it – that this process is not going to be open forever, we mean it.  We – this is not something that we could go on indefinitely.  There’s – we’ve had serious discussions, and I don’t – as I’ve said, we’ve made progress, and the Iranians have been serious in the talks so far, but we do have differences.  And if we can’t bridge them in the foreseeable future, I think we’re going to have to regroup and figure out how we move ahead.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Courtney McBride.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Courtney, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  So assuming – I understand that you are loathe to talk about timelines, but how does the administration hope to get follow-on talks with President-elect Raisi?  And how do you – do you acknowledge that he would need to be removed from the sanctions list as part of a broader discussion in hope of a broader agreement with Iran?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  So, I mean, I’ll repeat what I said about the follow-on talks.  I think we couldn’t have been clearer about what our position is on that, that we think – we believe that it has to be a part of what – of the process that we’re discussing right now, and we’re in the middle of discussing the nature of what those talks could be.  We know what Iran’s position is, but that’s why one of their – these are one of many reasons that we are still engaged in the talks and why we haven’t concluded them yet.</p>
<p>And I’ll also add again that there are issues that Iran feels that need to be addressed which go beyond the four corners of the JCPOA, and the only way to address those is going to be by continuing conversations in some format with us, and so we believe that this is something that’s not just a U.S. interest.  It happens to also be an Iranian interest, although they’ll be a better judge of that.</p>
<p>And on the question of sanctions, I think National Security Advisor Sullivan addressed it the other day.  We’re not going to get into details of what we might do.  We’re going to look at what we – what sanctions relief we believe we need to take in order to be back in compliance with the JCPOA, and that’s what we’re going to be judging in terms of the steps that we’ll be prepared to take if – and I emphasize if we’re back in a deal.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Okay.  Let’s go to the line of Michel Ghandour.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Michel, go ahead.  Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah, thank you for doing this.  There are calls from the Congress to the administration to take the election of President Raisi as an opportunity for not joining or rejoining the JCPOA.  What’s your answer to that?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  My answer to that:  We’re not involved in negotiations because we trust, like, or have anything or share any values in common with our Iranian counterparts.  We’re doing it precisely because we have very deep concerns, very serious issues.  And so the fact that there is now a new president – or there will soon be a new president of Iran does not detract our core national security interest, which is to reach a deal that puts their nuclear program in a box and makes sure that we prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  The identity of the Iranian president doesn’t have an impact on that, core national security interests.  And I would add, again, as the National Security Advisor said, that we know that the president in the Iranian system is not the sole and not even the chief decision-maker.  It’s a leadership in which the supreme leader has the ultimate word, and that position, that person has not changed as a result of the Iranian elections.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Laura Rosen.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Laura, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  , as I understand, not all the other countries in the P4+1 agree there should be a follow-on deal.  Can you speak to that?  I mean, I think Russia especially has said they think the JCPOA is sufficient.  So does that affect something being in a document with Iran that would call for follow-on talks?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Our position is our position.  We’ve had many conversations with Russia, and I wouldn’t characterize &#8212;</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  I think somebody’s on this call.  I think I recognize their voice, but yeah, okay.  So I’m saying we know – we had many discussions with our Russian colleagues about this.  I’m not going to characterize their position.  I think many countries have agreed that they want more diplomacy with Iran to address a range of issues, including regional issues, and Russia has been at the – one of the parties that has put forward ideas for what that diplomacy could look like.  So I’m not sure that I would fully agree with how you put it, but there are differences of views, but our position is very clear – is that we’re going to need follow-on talks, discussions to strengthen the deal.</p>
<p>And again, we would make the point that this is not only something that we think would help us.  We do think that it would help – it would – it should be in Iran’s interest because they have issues that they’re going to want to bring to the table.  Of course, that – as I said, that’s going to be – they will have to make that assessment, but our position has been clear from the day we started these talks and very familiar to all the parties who are there, and they know that’s America’s position.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  We have time for just a couple more questions.  Let’s go to the line of Nadia Bilbassy.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And one moment.  Nadia, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you so much.  Thank you,  and , for doing this.</p>
<p>, you just said that nothing agreed until all agreed.  You have been – it’s been six sessions so far and you’re entering the seventh.  Can you just outline for us what exactly you agreed upon?  Is it just a framework, is it technical issues, is it more than that?</p>
<p>And second, I’m sure you have seen the statements coming from the (inaudible) office saying that you’re going to lift sanction on the supreme leader.  Do you see this as, like, a (inaudible)?  Is it a lie from the Iranian?  Is it propaganda trying to get you to where they want?  How do you see it?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks, Nadia.  So if I understood your question, I mean, when I say nothing’s agreed until everything is agreed, that’s precisely what I meant.  So there’s nothing.  It’s not like there’s a framework or – we are still negotiating every issue, whether it’s the scope of sanctions relief, the scope of the steps that Iran will take to come back into compliance with its nuclear obligations, the sequence – all of those are still being discussed, and so we don’t have like a provisional deal on anything.  We are still working through all the issues, and that includes the issues of sanctions that you mentioned.  We will have to see.</p>
<p>And again, I don’t want – I’m not going to negotiate in public, but at this point we need to continue negotiating to see whether we could reach a comprehensive package that will be satisfactory, and at this point we’re not there yet.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Let’s go to the line of Farhad Pouladi.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>And Farhad, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yes, hi.  Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yes, we hear you.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>Yes, we can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Perfect.  So my question is in regard to the Israeli Government’s comments on the JCPOA, or the JCPOA resurrection talks in Vienna.  Prime Minister Netanyahu was staunchly against the deal, but the position has been actually transferred to the new government and they are still against the JCPOA.  I covered what comments came out of General Kochavi’s visit yesterday and today.  And also today, Prime Minister Bennett says that this regime – the one that no one should do business with.  How concerned are you that they may take any unilateral action, and what has the Biden administration been doing to persuade them not to do anything to jeopardize the talks?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thank you, Farhad.  That’s an important question.  I want to start by saying we – under the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu, we were having close consultations.  We know – we knew that they have and we know they had a different view about the JCPOA, but we are trying to talk to them to make sure that we were as aligned as possible given our common objective, which is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  We had differences about the JCPOA.  We knew that, we recognized it, but we nonetheless were working closely with them.</p>
<p>And the same holds for the government of Prime Minister Bennett.  We already had some high-level contacts.  I think you all know that Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lapid will be meeting in Rome on Sunday.  I don’t know the agenda, but I would be surprised if Iran did not figure in those conversations.  And again, we respect that they have a different point of view.  I think they respect ours and we are going to try to talk and be as transparent and as coordinated as possible so that the ultimate goal, which we share, is one that is pursued as effectively as possible.  And we expect to have extremely positive and productive discussions with the new Israeli Government and we look forward to as close coordination as possible.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Okay, thanks.  Just a couple more questions.  Let’s go to the line of Halley Toosi.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment.  And Halley, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, thanks for doing this.  A couple questions.  When it comes to the follow-on agreements, does the United States want to include human rights as one of the issues that is negotiated along with ballistic missiles and support for terrorism and all that?</p>
<p>Secondly, you said that there are indirect talks on the hostages.  Can you tell us a little bit more about those discussions?  Like are you talking about a potential prisoner exchange, and is it totally on a separate track from the nuclear discussion?  Any information you can give on that.</p>
<p>And also lastly, what is the most surprising thing that’s happened in this process for you?  What’s something you just didn’t expect, but that’s come up?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thanks.  So on the follow-on talks, listen, we know that there are a number of issues that – concerns that we have above and beyond the nuclear issue which is central.  There are lots of concerns.  Some of them will be negotiated in some formal way, others will be dealt with through other means.  So I’m not going to get into the details of what they will cover, but we – all of the issues you mentioned and that I mentioned are issues of real concern to this administration, but the format, the shape that those discussions or other diplomatic tools will take to address them I won’t get into.  But again, it doesn’t mean that we’re going to ignore any issue.  All of them will be pursued in one fashion or another.</p>
<p>On the detainee issue, they are separate.  These are separate conversations that are being held.  Obviously, we – we’re doing them more intensely when we are in Vienna because we could get communication to a third party more quickly, but they’re separate from the nuclear talks and, as I said, they are absolute priority.  Regardless of what happens with the JCPOA, we want our detainees, our citizens, wrongfully-held citizens back home as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Out of what’s been most surprising, I’m at a loss to say.  I mean, it is unusual to have these discussions in an indirect fashion.  I’ve said that many times before.  It is ripe for misunderstanding.  It’s ripe for prolonging the talks.  It’s not the most effective way to do it.  It means that we spend a lot of time in hotel rooms with our European and other colleagues and not with the party that we’re supposed to be negotiating with.  But by this point, we’ve gotten used to it, so we’ll make do.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  And I think we have time for one more question.  Let’s go to Arshad Mohammed.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Arshad, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah, thanks for coming back to me.  Just to ask one specific question, do you have any idea now when the seventh round of talks will begin in Vienna?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  No.  I mean, we assume that there is obviously consultations going on in Iran given – in Tehran given the election.  And when those consultations will have concluded, we will be notified, and then we’ll figure out when we meet again.  But at this point, I don’t have – I don’t have any plane reservations.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Okay, I think that’s our last question.  I just want to quickly thank our senior State Department official, .  Just as a reminder to everyone, this call today is on background, and so you can refer to our briefer as a senior State Department official.  With that, this briefing is ended and the embargo is lifted.  Have a good day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Via Teleconference</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Thank you.  Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining our call.  We have with us today .   is going to address the current status of the situation following conclusion of the sixth round of talks.  Just as a reminder,  will be speaking today on background.  And you may refer to him as a Senior State Department Official for the purposes of your reporting.</p>
<p>Also as another reminder, this call is embargoed until the conclusion of the call.  And the audio from this session is not for broadcast or replay.  So just one more time, this on background to a Senior State Department Official.  And with that, I’m going to go ahead and turn it over to  for ’s remarks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thank you.  And thanks for doing this again.  I know that in the last few weeks there’s been some confusion, some reporting that may have been – that have added to that confusion.  And part of it could be because we haven’t done one of these some time, so I’m glad to do it again and try to clear up any confusion that may exist.  So I’ll be brief in what I’ll say at the top, just to try to address two issues that I think have caused some of that imprecision.</p>
<p>First, where we are on the talks – and there has been some reporting that we basically have a deal already with Iran, that it’s just a matter of deciding when we’re going to put it out.  Let me make it absolutely clear:  We just concluded round six.  We will be resuming – or coming back for round seven sometime in the not-too-distant future, and we wouldn’t be doing that if the deal were already done.  We still have serious differences that have not been bridged, serious differences with Iran over the host of issues, whether it’s the nuclear steps that Iran needs to take to come back into compliance, the sanctions relief that the U.S. will be offering, or the sequence of steps that both sides would be taking.  Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  And since everything is not agreed, we still don’t have anything nailed down.  And there’s still some very important issues that need to be resolved.  By the same token, we wouldn’t be going back for a seventh round if we didn’t think that a deal was possible.  It remains possible.  It remains our objective, but we’re not there yet, and I’m not going to speculate as to if or when we will get there.</p>
<p>Second point, as to the issue of timing and in particular the impact of the elections (inaudible), first I think we’ve said already what we thought of the elections and of the new president, the fact that this was a pre-manufactured process that did not reflect the will of the Iranian people.  And we also have said what we thought about the background of the president-elect.  That said, from our point of view, it does not affect our determination to try to reach a deal or the pace at which we will go about pursuing it.  We’re not going to second guess any effect that it might have on Iranian decision making, but our goal is to pursue the objective that President Biden laid out both during the campaign and since, which is to try to address – diplomatically by – is our preference – our goal of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>And we believe that diplomacy, by returning to the JCPOA, is the best way to achieve that goal, and we’ll do it with whoever is in power with Iran precisely because we have serious – very serious – differences with their leadership.  And we believe that preventing them from acquiring a nuclear weapon is an important step in then trying to address the other issues that we have with Iran.  Because again, as President Biden and the Secretary of State have made clear, we see the return to the JCPOA as a beginning of a diplomatic process, not at the end, because we have many other issues of concern that we need to raise from Iran’s (inaudible) groups in the region, to its ballistic missile program, to its many other destabilizing activities.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say a word about an issue which is as important as anything I’ve said already, which is the issue of American citizens who are wrongfully detained in Iran.  That I still need to raise this, that they’re still not home, is a scandal and one that we are fighting every day to address.  And for Ahmad, for Siamak, for Baquer, for Morad, this is our priority.  We will not rest until they’re home and we’ll do everything in our power to make sure that that the day comes very, very soon.</p>
<p>So with that, I’m happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Great.  Thank you.  Let’s please go to the line of Nick Wadhams.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment, please.  Wait until I announce your line is open before speaking.  And Nick, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Thanks very much.  , understanding that you have differences on sequencing, do you – can you give us a sense for how the oil waivers would fit into this, whether you would grant waivers on day one or hold out to issue waivers until later on, maybe two to three months after the IAEA confirms compliance?  And would you be willing to give waivers without an IAEA confirmation of compliance?  And then second, can you just comment on the idea that the clock is ticking here because if too much time goes on, Iran will advance so far technologically that the original terms of the JCPOA essentially become moot, and you would have to negotiate an entirely new deal?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>So thanks, Nick.  So as to the first question, this may apply to a number of questions we’re going to get.  However much we’d prefer to be negotiating with the press corps than with Iran, it’s not what we’re going to do, so I’d rather – I won’t get into the details of what our position is on various issues, so I’ll skip the first question.</p>
<p>The second one about the clock, listen, there’s no – it’s not like there’s a scientific time at which point that threshold that you mentioned will be crossed, but certainly time is not a positive factor.  And this process won’t be open indefinitely, so we’re trying to get back into the deal.  We understand Iran is continuing to make progress, which is precisely why we believe withdrawing from the deal was a mistake and why we’re faced with this situation.  We’re going to try to get them back as soon as possible under the terms of the deal.  If it’s not done quickly and if Iran continues to make progress, of course it’s something that we’re going to have to consider in terms of the provisions of the deal that we’d be prepared to accept.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Let’s go to the line of Lara Jakes.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment.  And Lara, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.  And Lara, please check your mute button.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yes.  I’m sorry.  I was, in fact, on mute.  Apologies.  Thanks.  And  a minute ago you said that we see the return to the JCPOA as the beginning of the process and not the end.  Iran’s new president has very clearly said that he will not consider a longer and stronger deal for reining in the missile’s programs and the proxies.  So I’m wondering why you think that delta can be resolved.  And I’m also wondering if you’d speak a little bit about the IAEA inspections agreement that is, I think, expiring today.  I believe there’s a tentative agreement for it to be extended again.  Is that a reason for optimism?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks, Lara.  So on the first point, yeah, we’ve heard what President-Elect Raisi said.  Frankly, that’s not very different from what other Iranian leaders have been saying for some time.  But we’ve been equally clear, crystal-clear, and President Biden was crystal-clear on this, from the campaign and from his first day in office, which is that we believe that we can – are going to need to discuss other issues after we – assuming we get back into the JCPOA.  There are many issues of concern that we have, but also there’s issues that Iran wants to address, and they’ve made that very clear to us, including during this talks, that they – there are some elements that they are asking for, which go beyond the terms of the JCPOA.  So our position remains the same, that we see the return to the JCPOA as a beginning of a diplomatic process, and we believe that we’re going to need to engage in discussions with Iran, various things to address those other issues.  So we’ll have to find a way to resolve that difference.</p>
<p>On the IAEA, it’s good that you mention it.  Obviously we are concerned that at – from the time that I’m speaking – maybe there’s been news since – in the last hour or so, but we have not heard that there’s been an understanding.  If one is reached, that would be positive.  Although, we shouldn’t be playing – Iran should not be playing brinkmanship each time these agreements get extended.  I’d simply say that in the absence of such an understanding, in the absence of the IAEA being able to monitor what Iran is doing, it will be that much more complicated to get back into the JCPOA, because we’re going to have to know what the baseline of their nuclear program is.  And if the IAEA is blind for a certain amount of time and we don’t know what that baseline is, it’s going to be much more difficult to find a way back into the deal.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Jennifer Hansler.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Jennifer, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hi, .  Thanks so much for doing this.  What are you telling the Iranians about guarantees that the U.S. won’t quit the deal in four years?  How are you assuaging their concerns on that?  And on the issue of the hostages, has there been any progress towards their release?  Is it still the case that their release is not a precondition for the U.S. re-entering the JCPOA?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks.  So, I mean, there is no such thing as a guarantee, and I think Iran knows it and we know it.  We have no guarantee; they have no guarantee.  That’s the way the JCPOA is built, that if one side violated, the other side would – its remedy would be to take countermanding steps.  But what we do think is that the best guarantee is to get back into the deal and to implement it faithfully, and that’s – and we think that there’s a – that’s the best answer, because there is no such thing as a guarantee.</p>
<p>Secondly, on the question of the detainees, it’s the same thing as I said about the deal.  Because nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, because we don’t have a deal yet, I’m not going to speak about how close we are.  Yet, we’ve made progress.  We were engaged in indirect discussions with Iran about their release, but we’re not there yet, and until we’re there I don&#8217;t want to give false hopes to the families who’ve suffered too much already.  And as I’ve said in the past, it is a priority, and we are absolutely insistent that the four American citizens who are wrongfully detained be released.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  And let’s go the line of Arshad Mohammed.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Arshad, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.  And Arshad, please check your mute button.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you, and sorry about mute.  Two things.  One, would you continue the negotiations if Iran fails to extend its agreement with the IAEA?  And secondly, you said this process will not be open indefinitely.  What happens if you cannot reach an agreement by August 3rd, the date on which the Raisi administration takes office?  Is that when the door closes?  Or is the door open?  It may be indefinite, but it could be open for months or even years?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks.  And I know that both two good but difficult questions.  We still hope that Iran will extend its technical understanding with the IAEA or find – not prolong the understandings that currently exist.  As I said, it would be an issue of real concern if they didn’t.  I’m not going to speculate as to what impact it would have on the talks, but I think it is – we’ve already indicated clearly to Iran that it would be extremely complicated if they – a complicating factor if they did not find a way to continue the understandings with the IAEA.</p>
<p>On your second question, again, I’m not going to sit here and say there’s a deadline.  Obviously this will be a decision for the President and his national security team to take.  But when we’ve said – and others have said it – that this process is not going to be open forever, we mean it.  We – this is not something that we could go on indefinitely.  There’s – we’ve had serious discussions, and I don’t – as I’ve said, we’ve made progress, and the Iranians have been serious in the talks so far, but we do have differences.  And if we can’t bridge them in the foreseeable future, I think we’re going to have to regroup and figure out how we move ahead.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Let’s go to the line of Courtney McBride.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Courtney, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  So assuming – I understand that you are loathe to talk about timelines, but how does the administration hope to get follow-on talks with President-elect Raisi?  And how do you – do you acknowledge that he would need to be removed from the sanctions list as part of a broader discussion in hope of a broader agreement with Iran?  Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  So, I mean, I’ll repeat what I said about the follow-on talks.  I think we couldn’t have been clearer about what our position is on that, that we think – we believe that it has to be a part of what – of the process that we’re discussing right now, and we’re in the middle of discussing the nature of what those talks could be.  We know what Iran’s position is, but that’s why one of their – these are one of many reasons that we are still engaged in the talks and why we haven’t concluded them yet.</p>
<p>And I’ll also add again that there are issues that Iran feels that need to be addressed which go beyond the four corners of the JCPOA, and the only way to address those is going to be by continuing conversations in some format with us, and so we believe that this is something that’s not just a U.S. interest.  It happens to also be an Iranian interest, although they’ll be a better judge of that.</p>
<p>And on the question of sanctions, I think National Security Advisor Sullivan addressed it the other day.  We’re not going to get into details of what we might do.  We’re going to look at what we – what sanctions relief we believe we need to take in order to be back in compliance with the JCPOA, and that’s what we’re going to be judging in terms of the steps that we’ll be prepared to take if – and I emphasize if we’re back in a deal.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Okay.  Let’s go to the line of Michel Ghandour.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Michel, go ahead.  Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah, thank you for doing this.  There are calls from the Congress to the administration to take the election of President Raisi as an opportunity for not joining or rejoining the JCPOA.  What’s your answer to that?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  My answer to that:  We’re not involved in negotiations because we trust, like, or have anything or share any values in common with our Iranian counterparts.  We’re doing it precisely because we have very deep concerns, very serious issues.  And so the fact that there is now a new president – or there will soon be a new president of Iran does not detract our core national security interest, which is to reach a deal that puts their nuclear program in a box and makes sure that we prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  The identity of the Iranian president doesn’t have an impact on that, core national security interests.  And I would add, again, as the National Security Advisor said, that we know that the president in the Iranian system is not the sole and not even the chief decision-maker.  It’s a leadership in which the supreme leader has the ultimate word, and that position, that person has not changed as a result of the Iranian elections.</p>

<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Our position is our position.  We’ve had many conversations with Russia, and I wouldn’t characterize &#8212;</p>
<p>(Break.)</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  I think somebody’s on this call.  I think I recognize their voice, but yeah, okay.  So I’m saying we know – we had many discussions with our Russian colleagues about this.  I’m not going to characterize their position.  I think many countries have agreed that they want more diplomacy with Iran to address a range of issues, including regional issues, and Russia has been at the – one of the parties that has put forward ideas for what that diplomacy could look like.  So I’m not sure that I would fully agree with how you put it, but there are differences of views, but our position is very clear – is that we’re going to need follow-on talks, discussions to strengthen the deal.</p>

<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  Thanks, Nadia.  So if I understood your question, I mean, when I say nothing’s agreed until everything is agreed, that’s precisely what I meant.  So there’s nothing.  It’s not like there’s a framework or – we are still negotiating every issue, whether it’s the scope of sanctions relief, the scope of the steps that Iran will take to come back into compliance with its nuclear obligations, the sequence – all of those are still being discussed, and so we don’t have like a provisional deal on anything.  We are still working through all the issues, and that includes the issues of sanctions that you mentioned.  We will have to see.</p>

<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Let’s go to the line of Farhad Pouladi.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>And Farhad, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yes, hi.  Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Yes, we hear you.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>Yes, we can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Perfect.  So my question is in regard to the Israeli Government’s comments on the JCPOA, or the JCPOA resurrection talks in Vienna.  Prime Minister Netanyahu was staunchly against the deal, but the position has been actually transferred to the new government and they are still against the JCPOA.  I covered what comments came out of General Kochavi’s visit yesterday and today.  And also today, Prime Minister Bennett says that this regime – the one that no one should do business with.  How concerned are you that they may take any unilateral action, and what has the Biden administration been doing to persuade them not to do anything to jeopardize the talks?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thank you, Farhad.  That’s an important question.  I want to start by saying we – under the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu, we were having close consultations.  We know – we knew that they have and we know they had a different view about the JCPOA, but we are trying to talk to them to make sure that we were as aligned as possible given our common objective, which is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  We had differences about the JCPOA.  We knew that, we recognized it, but we nonetheless were working closely with them.</p>
<p>And the same holds for the government of Prime Minister Bennett.  We already had some high-level contacts.  I think you all know that Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lapid will be meeting in Rome on Sunday.  I don’t know the agenda, but I would be surprised if Iran did not figure in those conversations.  And again, we respect that they have a different point of view.  I think they respect ours and we are going to try to talk and be as transparent and as coordinated as possible so that the ultimate goal, which we share, is one that is pursued as effectively as possible.  And we expect to have extremely positive and productive discussions with the new Israeli Government and we look forward to as close coordination as possible.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Okay, thanks.  Just a couple more questions.  Let’s go to the line of Halley Toosi.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:  </strong>One moment.  And Halley, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, thanks for doing this.  A couple questions.  When it comes to the follow-on agreements, does the United States want to include human rights as one of the issues that is negotiated along with ballistic missiles and support for terrorism and all that?</p>
<p>Secondly, you said that there are indirect talks on the hostages.  Can you tell us a little bit more about those discussions?  Like are you talking about a potential prisoner exchange, and is it totally on a separate track from the nuclear discussion?  Any information you can give on that.</p>
<p>And also lastly, what is the most surprising thing that’s happened in this process for you?  What’s something you just didn’t expect, but that’s come up?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  </strong>Thanks.  So on the follow-on talks, listen, we know that there are a number of issues that – concerns that we have above and beyond the nuclear issue which is central.  There are lots of concerns.  Some of them will be negotiated in some formal way, others will be dealt with through other means.  So I’m not going to get into the details of what they will cover, but we – all of the issues you mentioned and that I mentioned are issues of real concern to this administration, but the format, the shape that those discussions or other diplomatic tools will take to address them I won’t get into.  But again, it doesn’t mean that we’re going to ignore any issue.  All of them will be pursued in one fashion or another.</p>
<p>On the detainee issue, they are separate.  These are separate conversations that are being held.  Obviously, we – we’re doing them more intensely when we are in Vienna because we could get communication to a third party more quickly, but they’re separate from the nuclear talks and, as I said, they are absolute priority.  Regardless of what happens with the JCPOA, we want our detainees, our citizens, wrongfully-held citizens back home as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Out of what’s been most surprising, I’m at a loss to say.  I mean, it is unusual to have these discussions in an indirect fashion.  I’ve said that many times before.  It is ripe for misunderstanding.  It’s ripe for prolonging the talks.  It’s not the most effective way to do it.  It means that we spend a lot of time in hotel rooms with our European and other colleagues and not with the party that we’re supposed to be negotiating with.  But by this point, we’ve gotten used to it, so we’ll make do.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  And I think we have time for one more question.  Let’s go to Arshad Mohammed.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong>  And Arshad, your line is open.  Please, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Yeah, thanks for coming back to me.  Just to ask one specific question, do you have any idea now when the seventh round of talks will begin in Vienna?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:</strong>  No.  I mean, we assume that there is obviously consultations going on in Iran given – in Tehran given the election.  And when those consultations will have concluded, we will be notified, and then we’ll figure out when we meet again.  But at this point, I don’t have – I don’t have any plane reservations.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Okay, I think that’s our last question.  I just want to quickly thank our senior State Department official, .  Just as a reminder to everyone, this call today is on background, and so you can refer to our briefer as a senior State Department official.  With that, this briefing is ended and the embargo is lifted.  Have a good day.</p>
