					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Troika (Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America), Canada, Switzerland, and the European Union are alarmed by the February 9 arrests and detentions of several high-profile political figures.  These troubling actions are part of a recent pattern of arrests and detentions of civil society activists, journalists, and humanitarian workers occurring throughout Sudan these last weeks.  We condemn this harassment and intimidation on the part of Sudan’s military authorities.  This is wholly inconsistent with their stated commitment to participate constructively in a facilitated process to resolve Sudan’s political crisis to return to a democratic transition.</p>
<p>We call for an immediate end to such practices and for the immediate release of all those unjustly detained.  We remind Sudan’s military authorities of their obligations to respect the human rights and guarantee the safety of those detained or arrested and the need to ensure that due process is consistently followed in all cases.  The lifting of the state of emergency, declared at the time of the October 25 military takeover would send a positive signal.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Department of State welcomes the issuance today of a report by a committee of the International Labor Organization (ILO) calling on the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to review, repeal, and revise its laws and practices of employment discrimination against racial and religious minorities in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This report, produced by the ILO’s <wbr />Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, <wbr />expresses deep concern regarding the PRC’s policies and calls on <wbr />the PRC government to take specific steps toward eliminating <wbr />racial and religious discrimination in employment and occupation, and to amend <wbr />national and regional policies utilizing vocational training and rehabilitation centers for “political re-education&#8221; based on administrative detention.</p>
<p>China joined the ILO in 1919 as one of the founding member states. The United States calls on the PRC to take the steps requested by the Committee of Experts.  We also reiterate our call for the PRC to end its genocide and crimes against humanity perpetrated <wbr />against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, as well as its use of these groups for forced labor in Xinjiang and beyond. The State Department is committed to working with our international partners and allies to end forced labor and strengthen international action against the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The Committee’s report can be found here &#8211; <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_836653.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/&#8212;ed_norm/&#8212;relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_836653.pdf</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><em>Forbes, </em>in partnership with Statista, has named the U.S. Department of State as one of America’s Best Employers 2022.</p>
<p>Approximately 60,000 American workers at U.S. companies with more than 1,000 employees were asked to rate their willingness to recommend their own employer to friends and family.  Employees also evaluated other employers in their respective industries and identified factors that stood out either positively or negatively.</p>
<p>In total, 1,000 employers were recognized across 25 different industry sectors.</p>
<p>We are pleased to note that the Department of State ranked fifth out of 35 entities in the government services industry.</p>
<p>Further information about the survey can be found at:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Department of State is pleased to announce that Matt Murray will be the new U.S. Senior Official for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Senior Official Murray brings a wealth of experience to this position as a career member of the Senior Foreign Service. Throughout his 23 years in the Foreign Service, he has served primarily in economic policy roles both in Washington and at diplomatic posts in the Asia-Pacific region.<b><u></u></b></p>
<p>Senior Official Murray most recently led the State Department’s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs as Senior Bureau Official following an assignment as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Trade Policy and Negotiations.  His service in the Asia-Pacific region includes leadership roles both as Minister Counselor for Economic Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and Counselor for Economic Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Canberra.  He also directly supported U.S. engagement in APEC while working in the Office of the Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment during the U.S. host year in 2011.</p>
<p>The United States fully supports APEC’s mission to advance a free, fair, and open economic policy agenda that benefits U.S. workers, businesses, and families.  The 21 APEC member economies account for approximately 47 percent of global trade, and the region is the destination for more than 62 percent of U.S. goods exports.  Through engagement at APEC, the United States supports U.S. innovation and the digital economy; helps U.S. companies do business and support jobs and families here at home; expands women’s participation in the economy; and promotes healthy, resilient, and sustainable economies.  APEC is a forum for the United States to help the region’s economies recover from the pandemic, enhance climate action, and support economic prosperity for our workers and all our people.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States welcomes the offer announced today by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to begin negotiating a new Defense Cooperation Agreement. When concluded, this agreement will allow our countries to deepen our close security partnership, further strengthen cooperation in NATO operations, and together, contribute to continued growth in Transatlantic security.</p>
<p>These negotiations represent a natural progression in our decades of security cooperation. In doing so, we look to build on the 1951 NATO Status of Forces Agreement to enhance interoperability to meet shared security challenges more effectively.</p>
<p>Our alliances are a core source of American strength. The United States and Denmark work closely together on a wide range of issues important to both countries, to the NATO Alliance, and to the rest of the world. Opening these consultations with Denmark reflects our commitment to reaffirming and reinvigorating America’s alliances to meet common security challenges while protecting shared interests and values.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Melbourne, Australia</p>
<p>Royal Botanic Gardens</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  It’s great to be with you.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  How would U.S. intervention in the case of a Russian invasion of Ukraine differ to the case of, say, a Chinese incursion into Taiwan?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, it’s hard to compare very, very different situations, but what we’re committed to in the case of Ukraine is doing everything we can to defend Ukraine’s territorial integrity, its sovereignty, its independence, which unfortunately is being challenged right now by Russia.  We’ve made very clear to Russia that there are two paths going forward: there’s a diplomatic path, a path of diplomacy, dialogue to see if we can find answers to security concerns that Russia has expressed and that we’ve expressed about Russia’s conduct; but equally, if Russia chooses to renew its aggression against Ukraine, we’ve made clear – not just us but countries throughout Europe and even beyond – that there’ll be massive consequences.</p>
<p>So my hope is that Russia will be deterred by the actions that we’ve taken to build &#8212; to bring together many, many countries that stand against renewed aggression by Russia in Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  President Biden says that if an invasion occurs, the planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany won’t go ahead.  The German chancellor has been a bit more vague on that.  How would America stop that pipeline given it’s not on U.S. territory?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, the President has been very clear that if there is renewed aggression by Russia in Ukraine, it’s very hard to see gas ever flowing through that pipeline.  And right now the pipeline is actually a source of leverage for us, not for Russia, precisely because gas has not yet begun to flow through it.  To the extent that President Putin wants to see that happen, the idea that that could happen if he commits aggression against Ukraine is very, very hard to see.  So that may make him think twice about taking action in Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Who does the Biden administration view as a bigger threat to global security, Russia or China?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  These are, again, very different challenges.  Russia right now poses an immediate challenge not just to Ukraine through the possibility of renewed aggression, but to some very basic principles that are relevant to the security not just of people in Europe but throughout the world, including in Australia – principles like you can’t just change the borders of another country by force; you can’t decide for another country its choices, its policies, with whom it will associate; you can’t exert a sphere of influence that tries to subjugate your neighbors to your will.  Those are the basic principles that are at stake when it comes to Ukraine and Russia’s aggression, and they’re relevant right here in this part of the world just as they are in Europe.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  You’re here for the meeting.  Is the Quad grouping about countering the influence of China in this region?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The Quad fundamentally is about presenting an affirmative vision and affirmative action to deal with some of the main challenges of our time as well as to find opportunities and to make the most of them.  So bringing these countries together to deal with something that’s afflicting everyone – COVID – that is again about dealing with something very concrete in people’s lives.  How we think about emerging technology and the rules and norms and standards that shape it – the Quad is coming together on that.  How we make our economies more resilient, not only recovering from COVID but producing greater resiliency over time through diversified supply chains, for example – that’s what the Quad is all about.</p>
<p>So it’s coming together, using the talents, the resources, the different skill sets that we – that these four countries have, as well as potentially working with other countries.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Australia’s Defense Minister Peter Dutton has warned that Australia and its allies will lose the next decade unless they stand up to China in the South China Sea.  What’s your take on that?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  What we have to do and what we are doing is standing up for the norms, the rules, the standards, the values that unite it – that unite us.  So this is not about standing against anyone in particular; it is about standing up for a rules-based order, making sure that we uphold those rules and principles if they’re being challenged.  Because it’s exactly that that’s undergirded peace, security, and opportunity for people for decades.  So when they’re being challenged, we have an obligation to stand up.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Against that backdrop, Russia and China’s leaders met on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics earlier this week and they declared that they have a no-limits partnership.  That has to be of some concern given the context that you just painted there.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  China and Russia have been growing closer over many, many years, so this is not – this is not new.  I have to say, if – and we of course were not in the room when the two leaders met, but I would imagine that, for example, China would have some issues with Russia’s threats to Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.  China talks a lot about upholding the principle of sovereignty.  Well, maybe it has something to say about that.  Russian aggression in Ukraine would not be good for anyone.  It wouldn’t be good for China either.  And so one would think that it would have shared some of its concerns with Russia.</p>
<p>Russia and China are talking.  We’re engaged, the United States, with dozens of partners throughout Europe, around the world, NATO, the European Union, the G7, here through the Quad, AUKUS, you name it.  We have a multiplicity of alliances, of partnerships, of coalitions to deal with issues of concern to our people.  That’s actually been our greatest strength.  And these partnerships, these alliances, not only are they voluntary, they’re based on a shared set of values and basic interests.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  You mentioned AUKUS.  The French Government was put out, to say the least, by its submarine contract with Australia being shelved due to the new security pact between Australia, the UK, and the U.S.  The French said that they were blindsided by what happened.  Were they, and who was responsible for that?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Look, I said at the time that we, speaking for ourselves, the United States could have done a better job communicating with our French allies and partners on this.  But we are working incredibly closely together as partners.  We’re doing the same thing through NATO, with the European Union, the G7.  And so I think the strength of that relationship, of that partnership is as good as it’s ever been.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Which country first floated the idea of a security pact between Australia, the U.S., and the UK, including finding a way to have – for Australia to have nuclear submarines?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, I’m not going to go back and revisit the entire history of this, but certainly this is something that was raised early on by Australia, by the United Kingdom.  And of course part of what we’re doing around the world, as I said, is working to revitalize, to re-energize, and, as necessary, to reinvent these alliances and partnerships because for us, as we’re looking at the problems that afflict our people as well as the opportunities, whether it’s dealing with climate, whether it’s dealing with COVID, whether it’s dealing with emerging technologies, whether it’s dealing with security, not a single one of these problems can be effectively addressed by any one of our countries working alone.  We are much stronger when we find ways to work together.  And that’s why we’ve invested so much in not only our traditional alliances, but in creating new coalitions, new partnerships to focus on specific issues.  That’s what AUKUS is about, it’s what the Quad is about, as well as the traditional alliances like NATO and other organizations.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Final question, Mr. Secretary.  The U.S. under Donald Trump’s leadership was beset with internal turmoil and division that hasn’t resolved.  The president ran an erratic foreign and domestic policy, to say the least.  Why would a country like Australia continue to view the U.S. as a reliable ally given that some of those forces that delivered Donald Trump the presidency are still at play?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  No one can say with certainty what the future will bring.  We have to be grounded in the present.  What are the challenges that our people are facing?  How can we best and most effectively deal with them?  We’re convinced that it’s by doing it together, and you start with the countries that share your basic approach, that share your basic interests, that share your basic values.  And nowhere is that more true than between the United States and Australia.  And you go from there.  And ultimately we’re going to be judged, like anyone else is, by what we do and what we achieve.  And we’re living in the present and focused on the – on these challenges, focused on these opportunities, and we start with the conviction that they can best be addressed in partnership, and that’s exactly why we’ve spent a lot of time and effort to re-energize these alliances and these partnerships.  It’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Secretary Blinken, we really appreciate your time.  Thank you for speaking with us again.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks so much.  Good to be with you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Melbourne, Australia</p>
<p>University of Melbourne Biomedical Precinct</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you so much, Dean.  And it’s – thanks to everyone for being here today.  Really, it’s wonderful to be with you, it’s wonderful to be in Melbourne, and it’s wonderful to be at the university in no small measure because of the family connection that we have here.  And I should probably reveal, just cards on the table in case this is a problem for anyone – I have a particular allegiance to Carlton when it comes to (inaudible).  (Laughter.)  I’ve been, I’ve seen them play.  So I just wanted to make sure that I was honest about that.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>MS GUNN:</b>  We’ll allow it.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.</p>
<p>I really want to pick up, Dean, where you brought us because, look, as – at a national level between our countries, between Australia and the United States, I think it’s safe to say that we have been leaders, and leaders together, in trying to deal with COVID and also in trying to build back better so that we have an even stronger, more effective global health security system after we get through this.</p>
<p>But of course, we’re not through it yet and the work that we’re doing together, whether it comes to the production of vaccines, the distribution of vaccines, everything that goes into them, trying to get shots into arms, working on therapeutics, making sure that we’re supporting health care workers who are on the front lines of this – all of that is vitally important, and we know and we continue to experience that the cliché that no one is safe until everyone is safe is profoundly true.  And I know that between our governments – and this is something I’ll be spending some time on here – there is a very deep-seated commitment to do as much as we possibly can this year to really once and for all get ahead of this pandemic.  We’ve said – projected of having 70 percent vaccination in every country in the world by year’s end.  We intend to see that through, but we know the challenges that go with getting that done and getting that done effectively, but at the same time, as we’re doing that, we have to be building a stronger global health security system so that next time around we’re better prepared where we can deal more effectively; hopefully we can prevent, we can detect, we can mitigate more effectively.</p>
<p>But for all the work that the governments are doing – and it’s absolutely necessary – I think what gives me the most cause for optimism are the public-private partnerships that we’ve been building and, of course, the work of the private sector to finally get us to a better place.  And part of why I wanted to get together today, and I’m grateful to all of you for doing that, is to put a bit of a spotlight on that, and in particular the fact that America and Australia together are building these across our countries and across our governments and across our private sectors, building exactly these kind of interconnected partnerships where government can be the ultimate – a catalyst and a facilitator, but at the same time the private sector is doing extraordinary work to really advance our progress.</p>
<p>And I’m anxious to hear from all of you today.  I know from the work that’s been done it’s incredibly gratifying to have Moderna, which is I think a household name now literally around the world, and that’s quite extraordinary.  But the partnership with the Australian Government to open what will be the first mRNA facility, production facility here in this part of the world is a perfect example of how free, open societies can actually come together and deliver benefits not only for our own people but this is going to benefit people around the world.  So this will be the first facility in the Southern Hemisphere to manufacture mRNA vaccines, and that’s going to be a very powerful thing.  It&#8217;s also, I’m convinced, going to have a ripple effect – a ripple effect in terms of jobs, a ripple effect in terms of preparing for the future as we need to do, and a ripple effect around the world not just for our two countries but throughout the region and beyond.  And I think it only serves to further solidify Australia’s leadership in dealing with global health security, the pandemic, and the problem.</p>
<p>We have colleagues from Illumina here.  This is another great example of how close-knit our partnership is and doing it in a way that serves the public good.  Even in my short time here today and just in reading about the University of Melbourne and what’s going on here as a remarkable place of knowledge, of learning, of innovation, the genomics hub right here, a partnership again that is going to be serving the public good.  And there, too, the government has a profound role to play in this partnership with the private sector as well as work that’s being done with the university is actually making a difference, and I’m gratified again that American firms are part of this, making these investments, driving these partnerships.</p>
<p>We have IBM, and there again, working on another aspect of things, and that’s the – all the potential of artificial intelligence.  We are developing standards together – our governments are working on this as well – to make sure that as technology emerges, it does so in a way that lifts people up and tries to advance the common good and is not used for repressive or malign interests.</p>
<p>So there are multiple examples of this.  I just thought this was a wonderful way to illustrate how both our countries and governments are working together, but also how we’re doing this in a public-private way, and hopefully to the benefit of a lot of people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Melbourne, Australia</p>
<p>University of Melbourne Biomedical Precinct</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you so much, Dean.  And it’s – thanks to everyone for being here today.  Really, it’s wonderful to be with you, it’s wonderful to be in Melbourne, and it’s wonderful to be at the university in no small measure because of the family connection that we have here.  And I should probably reveal, just cards on the table in case this is a problem for anyone – I have a particular allegiance to Carlton when it comes to (inaudible).  (Laughter.)  I’ve been, I’ve seen them play.  So I just wanted to make sure that I was honest about that.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>MS GUNN:</b>  We’ll allow it.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.</p>
<p>I really want to pick up, Dean, where you brought us because, look, as – at a national level between our countries, between Australia and the United States, I think it’s safe to say that we have been leaders, and leaders together, in trying to deal with COVID and also in trying to build back better so that we have an even stronger, more effective global health security system after we get through this.</p>
<p>But of course, we’re not through it yet and the work that we’re doing together, whether it comes to the production of vaccines, the distribution of vaccines, everything that goes into them, trying to get shots into arms, working on therapeutics, making sure that we’re supporting health care workers who are on the front lines of this – all of that is vitally important, and we know and we continue to experience that the cliché that no one is safe until everyone is safe is profoundly true.  And I know that between our governments – and this is something I’ll be spending some time on here – there is a very deep-seated commitment to do as much as we possibly can this year to really once and for all get ahead of this pandemic.  We’ve said – projected of having 70 percent vaccination in every country in the world by year’s end.  We intend to see that through, but we know the challenges that go with getting that done and getting that done effectively, but at the same time, as we’re doing that, we have to be building a stronger global health security system so that next time around we’re better prepared where we can deal more effectively; hopefully we can prevent, we can detect, we can mitigate more effectively.</p>
<p>But for all the work that the governments are doing – and it’s absolutely necessary – I think what gives me the most cause for optimism are the public-private partnerships that we’ve been building and, of course, the work of the private sector to finally get us to a better place.  And part of why I wanted to get together today, and I’m grateful to all of you for doing that, is to put a bit of a spotlight on that, and in particular the fact that America and Australia together are building these across our countries and across our governments and across our private sectors, building exactly these kind of interconnected partnerships where government can be the ultimate – a catalyst and a facilitator, but at the same time the private sector is doing extraordinary work to really advance our progress.</p>
