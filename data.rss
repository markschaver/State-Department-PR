					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe</p>
<p><strong>MR NEUMARKER:</strong>  (In German.)  Dear Mr. Secretary of State of the United States of America.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) So everyone, I’d like to welcome you all here, and Minister Maas, (inaudible), also the vice president of the German association of Sinti and Roma in Germany, Ms. Romani Rose.</p>
<p>(In German.)</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) And I am the head and the chairperson of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe.  I’d like to hand over now to the moderator, Ms. Sauerbrey.</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and most importantly, also survivors.  And ladies and gentlemen, the memory of the Holocaust, to research it and also to then – also give this on to new generations this year in the U.S. and Germany.  We’ll then now sign a letter of intent on this.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken will speak to us.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good morning.  Foreign Minister Maas, Heiko, thank you for your partnership in launching what will be a historic dialogue.</p>
<p>Eighty years ago this week, Nazi forces invaded the Soviet-occupied city of Bialystok, Poland.  They pulled Jews from their homes, beat them, executed many on the spot.  Some forced older Jewish men to dance, and if they didn’t like the performance, set their beards on fire.</p>
<p>Then the Nazis herded more than 700 Jews into Bialystok’s synagogue and set it ablaze.</p>
<p>What happened in Bialystok was not isolated.  The barbarism was systematic.</p>
<p>By launching the U.S-Germany Dialogue on the Holocaust, we are helping to ensure that current and future generations learn about the Holocaust and also learn from it.</p>
<p>Together, we honor those who were killed.  They were not indistinct numbers, even if a number is seared in the minds of many of us.  But they were not just numbers.  They were not, as their killers saw them, indistinct, inhuman.  They were family members, they were friends, mothers, fathers, daughters, sisters, loved ones, human beings.</p>
<p>We honor the survivors who share their stories with enormous courage and determination, including those here today: Margot Friedlander, Franz Michalski, Peter Johan Gardosch.  You honor us with your presence, you honor us with your testimony, you honor us with your memory.</p>
<p>We study the past so that we can understand the Holocaust as more than the final act of exterminating six million Jews as well as Roma and Sinti, Slavs, disabled persons, LGBTQ individuals, and many others.  It was the culmination of countless individual steps designed to vilify and dehumanize people.</p>
<p>So we learned, for example, that as early as 1933, Jews were purged from Germany’s civil service, Jewish businesses boycotted, books by Jewish authors banned and burned in a massive pyre not very far from where we stand today.</p>
<p>Like the path through this memorial, the Shoah was not a sharp fall, but a gradual descent into darkness.  As survivor Primo Levi wrote, “To sink is the easiest of matters…like streams that run down to the sea.”</p>
<p>That understanding is particularly urgent today as survivors pass from us and those who deny the Holocaust are getting louder and finding insidious new ways to spread their lies.</p>
<p>A recent study found that during the pandemic, anti-Semitic content online increased seven-fold in French, thirteen-fold in German.</p>
<p>In recent months, a swastika was carved onto the door of a synagogue in America, museums dedicated to the Holocaust were defaced.</p>
<p>Today, as in the past, Holocaust denial and other forms of anti-Semitism often go hand-in-hand with homophobia, xenophobia, racism, other hatred.  It’s also a rallying cry for those who seek to tear down our democracies, which we’ve seen in both our countries is often a precursor to violence.</p>
<p>That’s why we have to find innovative ways to bring the history of the Holocaust to life not only to understand the past, but also to guide our present and to shape our future.</p>
<p>Together with the United States Holocaust Museum – Memorial Museum and the German Foundation for the Murdered Jews of Europe, our governments will strengthen Holocaust education.  We’ll counter Holocaust denial and distortion.  We’ll ensure that public servants, teachers, young people like the young leaders here today understand these issues in depth and feel a responsibility to stop atrocities wherever they occur.</p>
<p>We will build on decades of serious, remarkable work by Germany to grapple with the darkest past of its history, to honor all the victims of the Holocaust, to combat anti-Semitism, to foster a culture of remembrance here and around the world, including through leadership in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.  This work has become a defining part of our transatlantic relationship and of shoring up our democracies.</p>
<p>For just as dissent is incremental, so is the work of building up principles and practices that can make real the promise of “Never again,” like the steady march ascending from the depths of this memorial.</p>
<p>My late stepfather Samuel Pisar was 12 years old when the Nazis invaded his home of Bialystok, Poland.  A week later, they lined up hundreds of Jewish men and boys, including his cousins Isaac, Grisha, Frol, and mowed them down.</p>
<p>Days later, he and his family were forced to move to Bialystok’s newly walled-off ghetto.  His father David was disappeared first, then his uncle, and then his grandmother, and then he was separated from his mother Helaina, his little sister Freida, and sent to Treblinka, later to Majdanek, to Auschwitz, to Dachau.</p>
<p>When he was liberated by American soldiers in 1945, he was the only surviving member of his family.</p>
<p>During the Holocaust, ghettos like the one in Bialoystok were in the heart of cities just like this memorial.  That meant that beyond the Nazis, everyone in those cities knew that Jews lived there.  They knew the trains were leaving, packed with people day after day.  The evil was visible, but most chose to look away, to do nothing.</p>
<p>This dialogue will help us remember all that can be lost, but also help us to see all that we can save if we choose – if we choose to stand up rather than stand by.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  Thank you very much, Excellency, for these (inaudible) words.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) The German foreign minister now has the floor.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Survivors, ladies and gentlemen, my relationship with this nation’s poignant, painful, and powerful history is hazy.  I will never forget how much I loved the medieval city of Nuremburg, a city that was also the birthplace of the horrifying Nazi racial laws.  I cried privately at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, and I rejoiced after the fact in Germany’s World Cup victory.</p>
<p>The U.S. student Avi Colonomos wrote these words in 2014 when he was 20 years old.  He had come to Berlin with a transatlantic program, Germany Close Up, along with other young Jewish people to learn more about today’s Germany.  What Avi Colonomos describes is the inner conflict that goes hand-in-hand with remembrance.  We are conflicted between tears and joy, conflicted in the face of this history that pains and divides us, just as it moves and unites us in our shared humanity.  And yet understanding where we come from is, despite the sins of inner conflict, the best compass to determine which direction we want to go in.  To borrow the words  of James Baldwin writing in <em>The New York Times</em> in 1962, and I quote, “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”</p>
<p>The 2,710 concrete stelae that make up the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe behind me show us where we Germans come from and what we are responsible for.  The history of murder, horror, and suffering inflicted upon millions of people, incomparable, incontrovertible in its manmade monstrosity here between these stelae, created by the great U.S. architect Peter Eisenman, feelings of profound unease, solitude, grief, responsibility become almost palpable.  Yes, remembrance can be painful.  Yes, remembrance is a test of our mettle and it has to be painful.</p>
<p>And yet we stand here today, side by side, Americans and Germans, Jews, Muslims, Christians and Atheists united in shared remembrance, united by our belief in values such as freedom, democracy, and tolerance, united too in our determination to build a better future on this foundation of values.  That is what Europe is based on and that is what our transatlantic friendship is based on.</p>
<p>Dear Tony, I know how much your family’s personal experiences of the Holocaust influence what you do every day.  You’ve just shared this with us.  On your first day in office as Secretary of State, you said, and I quote, “I remember that the nation’s power isn’t measured only by the size of its military and economy, but by the moral choices it makes,” end of quote.  And the field of stelae behind us is proof of this statement cast in concrete.  America’s power, Germany’s and Europe’s power does not come from glorifying history or glossing over the wrong turns of the past, of which none led into such a terrible abyss as did the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Our strength lies in accepting the burden of historical responsibility unconditionally without drawing a final line.  Our strength lies in joining forces as we search for the best path forward and to do so together, ideally.</p>
<p>And so I am delighted, Dear Tony, that we’re here today in this unique place in the country of the perpetrators to launch a dialogue on Holocaust issues between the United States and Germany.  One of our most pressing tasks will be to prepare our culture of remembrance for changing times.  The memorial foundation with its director, Dr. Uwe Neumarker and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum do outstanding work here every day.  The American Jewish Committee and its director David Harris as well as the Leo Baeck Institute with William Weitzer are also working with us for a lively culture of remembrance.</p>
<p>And I’m grateful for these approaches for their work because I believe that future generations will no longer be able to benefit from personal encounters with contemporary witnesses.  What a great loss.  But at the same time, what a great undertaking for us to find new forms of remembrance which do not allow the stories of individuals to fade from our consciousness.  We owe this to the victims and the survivors, and we’re delighted and honored – dear Margot Friedlander; Mr. Gardosch, dear Peter; and Franz Michalski – that you are with us today.  And we owe it to our children and grandchildren who we want to prevent as far as we can from repeating the errors of the past.</p>
<p>In recent years, we have seen anti-Semitism and racism eating into our societies on both sides of the Atlantic.  Just think of the yellow star badges seen at demonstrations against COVID measures, of the torrent of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on the internet, of the attacks on synagogues and on Jewish people living in our countries, of the rioters in front of the Bundestag, or the rampaging mob in the U.S. Capitol.  The U.S. philosopher, Susan Neiman, president of the Einstein Forum in Potsdam and one of the wisest transatlantic voices in this country gave us a piece of advice some years ago that I believe to be very sage, namely that we must refuse to give evil – and racism and anti-Semitism are nothing other than that – any justification and any weight.  Only through this refusal and not through inaction, silence, or relativization can we subdue the forces that seek to divide our societies.</p>
<p>What we are doing here today will help.  Of course, remembrance is no panacea.  People in societies cannot make peace with their past as easily as that.  It remains a test, a source of inner conflict.  But sharing in remembrance with friends, as we are doing here today, unites us as we face up to this conflict.  And it strengthens us, and above all it strengthens our societies for the future.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>SAUERBREY:</strong>(Via interpreter) Thank you, Minister.  We now turn to the signing of the letter of intent.</li>
</ol>
<p>(The letter of intent is signed.)</p>
<p>And we have two more people to address us now.  First Ms. Margot Friedlander.  She was born in Berlin.  She survived the Holocaust in a number of hiding places until being deported in 1944 to Theresienstadt.  Her father, her mother, her brother, and many other relatives of her were murdered.  Margot Friedlander immigrated to the United States with her husband in 1946 and in 2010 she returned permanently to Berlin.  Ms. Friedlander, thank you for addressing us today.</p>
<p><strong>MS FRIEDLANDER:  </strong>I will tell you a little bit of my experiences.  In mid-January 1943, at about 2:00 p.m., I was on my way home from the factory where I was working (inaudible).  When I approached the house, I noticed a man entering the house.  I did not know him.  Is he waiting for someone?  To be careful, I covered my Jewish star before I was leaving – our apartment door was – happened for him, it is waiting.  I pass him coolly, walk up another floor, and ring the bell of Christian neighbors.  I hardly knew, hoping that they will be home.</p>
<p>I hear steps.  The doors open and the neighbors asked me quietly into the house.  On her face, I see stress, and I feel right away that something has happened.  She asked me into her living room; we both sit down, and she’s – she is telling me time, a few hours ago, she heard noise at the house.  “Open up,” banging on the door, then the clatter at the stairway, and she went to the window.  She saw them come out and rudely pushed them into the police car.  “Whom?” do I ask the neighbor.  “Some people I did not know?”  “The lady, Mrs. Meissner, who also lives in the apartment, and a boy.”</p>
<p>“My brother, Ralph; my mother?”  She tells me my mother was not there.  But one hour after she came home, she found the door locked and (inaudible).  I told her all –  “Where is she now?”  My mother was not waiting for me.  But she left a message with neighbors.  “Tell my daughter, if you should see her, I am going to the police.  I’m going with Ralph, wherever that will be.  Try to make your life.”  With her words, in my mind, I was able to find help and went underground into hiding.</p>
<p>German gentile people I have never seen before, humans, people with character and courage, helped me, who did not look away, but to do something that could have cost their head.  For 15 months, I was hiding with different people.  But in April 1944, my look – my luck ran out.  I was snitched and saw some good fortune.  I was deported to Theresienstadt, where again I was lucky to be able to work in a factory producing the splitting of glimmer that was needed for war effort.  That probably saved me from deportation from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz.  That was the fate of hundred thousands.</p>
<p>In early February 1945, a transport arrived, and with it came Adolf Friedlander.  They came from a special work arrangement near Frankfurt/Oder and because the Russians came closer, they were sent back to Theresienstadt.  I knew Adolf Friedlander years ago in Berlin.  It was so good to meet someone you had known in past life.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) I’ve lost track of where I am, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>(In English) Together, we experience the arrival of a transport in late February, about 10 days before liberation.  I got the assignment to help at the arrival of the train.  As the cattle car door was opened, the people, who were no more human – the masses fell out and were pushed out.  Many were already dead.  Men only, but indistinguishable looking – in striped-looking things like pajamas, but were already tatters.  They wear before Auschwitz was liberated on January 27, 1945, put on the death march for weeks, and the left ones, humans, were put on the cattle cars that now arrived in Theresienstadt, the one camp not liberated at the time.  At the moment I was seeing the masses, I realized I will not ever see my mother and brother again.</p>
<p>Adolf and I experienced the liberation together on the 8th of May, 1945, as, at first, the people who treated us as – left.  The Swiss International Cross came and the Red Cross flag was flying instead of the <em>Hakenkreuz</em>.  About 10 days later, they handed Theresienstadt over to the Russians.  That was on the 8th of May.</p>
<p>Weeks later, sitting on a bench talking to Adolf, he asked me if I could think of starting a life together with him in America, where his sister was living.  We got married on the 28th of June in Theresienstadt, just a day before the last rabbi left Theresienstadt.  One day after our marriage, a cable from his sister arrived, telling him how happy she is that he is alive and expect him in USA.</p>
<p>We left Theresienstadt in early July 1945 and spent one year in a DP camp in Germany before we could leave.  We arrived in July 28th in America.  My husband passed away in December 1997, after almost 53 years of a very special marriage.  We both had the same experience.  We both knew how very special life is.</p>
<p>A few months after my husband had passed away, I was asked to join the senior club of the 92nd Street Y, where my husband was in a leading position for 28 years.  There, many courses were offered, and after more than two years, a writing course started.  I was asked to join.  I was hesitant, but I did.  One night after sleep did not come, the memories, the many memories – I took paper and pen into the bed and started at last to tell my story.</p>
<p>For more than one year, for every course, I did tell the class one more experience, realizing right at the first meeting how very little they knew of these years, almost into my unimaginable happenings what was taking place under the Nazi regime, what humans did, (inaudible).</p>
<p>After living for 57 years in USA, I went for the first time in 2003 to Berlin where I was born and for a visit, and the possibility of planning to make a film, a documentary.  A filmmaker had heard about my story.  He did.  The film was shown in 2005 in Berlin at Jewish Film Festival.  After that, my life took a different turn, because I was asked to write something in German. Always thinking that for 70 years, I live with the messages my mother left for me, “Try to make your life,” I started to write my book.  It was published in Germany by Rowohlt.  It came out in (inaudible) with the title of the words my mother left for me, <em>Try To Make Your Life</em>.  In German, <em>Versuche, dein Leben zu machen</em>.</p>
<p>Right now, I came very often to Berlin because right at the start, I was asked to give readings in schools, bookstores, but many different places.  I talked – well, in cities in Germany, always finding that the students are most attentive, interested to talk to me, to ask questions, and want to know more about what my life is now after much (inaudible) experiences.  In 2009, I got surprise in German for the book as the best autobiography.  In July of 2009, I came to Berlin and stayed for seven months, having such wonderful experiences, meeting fine people.</p>
<p>People thank me for doing what now became my mission.  I often give two or three readings a week, again traveling to many cities.  I was reading always for one hour very special pages from the book, and telling to whom I spoke what I want them to do, what I do, because we will not be on with a life many – much longer, and it is for them that it should never happen again, that I don’t want anyone to experience what has been done to the 5 million Jews and millions of other innocent humans.</p>
<p>I tell them that there is no Christian, Jewish, or Muslim blood – that there’s only human blood.  We are all the same, that people did it because they did not respect humans.  Please, be a human being.</p>
<p>In 2010 I did return to Berlin for good, and never did I regret it for one moment.  And here I am and gold still – it’s now almost hundred years to talk to people.  It is for you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Thank you, Ms. Friedlander, for your words, for everything you have done for Holocaust remembrance and for everything you continue to do.  Margo Wieseler, 25 years old, will speak to us now.  She served as a volunteer at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center in Chicago, Illinois, Skokie.</p>
<p><strong>MS WIESELER:</strong>  Good morning.  Again, I would just really like to thank Ms. Friedlander.  Your words really shook me in a way I didn’t even expect, although I expected it to be emotional, but yeah.  So thank you very much, and your words of wisdom and passion are truly an inspiring call to action for my generation.</p>
<p>I also want to thank Secretary Blinken and Secretary Maas for highlighting innovative ways to commemorate the Holocaust.  Initiatives to preserve the voices of our survivors are essential to prevent my generation from choosing the ease of forgetting over the pain or the shame of remembering.  And sometimes standard high-school-level history education can sadly reinforce this tendency, as it can make the Holocaust feel unpersonal and much more distant than it is.</p>
<p>I myself only recently really started confronting my family history and involvement when I began to prepare for my year abroad with <em>Aktion Suhnezeichen Friedensdienste</em>.  <em>Aktion Suhnezeichen</em> is a German NGO aiding reconciliation between victims of Nazi persecution and young Germans today.  And with the help of them, I had the unique opportunity and great privilege to spend a year volunteering at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center, a world-leading institution in the field of digitalized Holocaust remembrance in Chicago.</p>
<p>So – and I did find my motivation for serving in the museum in my family history.  My great grandfather was a member of the Reichstag, appointed by the Nazi party.  I was, still am, and will always be ashamed of this piece of my family’s history, and I was especially anxious to share this with the survivors and their families.  They had every reason to be dismissive, hurt, or even hostile towards me, but to my great relief their response was full of love, understanding, and even curiosity towards me and my motivations.</p>
<p>This ability to distinguish between my generation and our ancestors left a lasting impression on me.  I was especially amazed by Fritzie Fritzshall, the museum’s longtime president and a teenage survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau, who heavily accepted an invitation to dinner from me and a friend.  And the cuisine would be German, obviously.</p>
<p>In devastating news, Fritzie sadly died last weekend, leaving another hole that will never be filled.  However, her impressing ability to disband black-and-white thinking in place of a more nuanced approach is, I think, something I learned from and everybody else can do.</p>
<p>My generation, young as we are, has been fortunate enough to hear the stories of the Holocaust directly from survivors, reminding us just how recent these atrocities truly were.  Because they were – they did happen before our lifetimes.  With each passing day, preserving and retelling these lessons gets more important, lest we begin to distance ourselves and forget the lessons learned.</p>
<p>My year with <em>Aktion Suhnezeichen </em>has forever changed me, and I can confidently say that I understand the importance of combating anti-Semitism and using that voice to fight for a free and fair society better than before.  If young people like me sincerely want to make “Never again” or “<em>Nie wieder</em>” a reality, we must never stop openly building bridges between the most painful hours of the past, our lives today, and the future we wish to see.</p>
<p>Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Thank you, Ms. Wieseler.  Ladies and gentlemen, the foreign ministers will now place a wreath on the Memorial to the Murdered Jews in Europe, and will then speak to the survivors who are with us today: Ms. Margot Friedlander, Peter Gardosch, and Franz Michalski.  Ms. Wieseler and a number of Anne Frank ambassadors are also here, peer guides and volunteers of the Anne Frank Center in Berlin.  Afterwards, this ceremony is concluded.  And I would like to use this opportunity to thank you on behalf of the foreign office and the U.S. Department of State for having come here.  Have a safe journey home.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

<p>Days later, he and his family were forced to move to Bialystok’s newly walled-off ghetto.  His father David was disappeared first, then his uncle, and then his grandmother, and then he was separated from his mother Helaina, his little sister Freida, and sent to Treblinka, later to Majdanek, to Auschwitz, to Dachau.</p>
<p>When he was liberated by American soldiers in 1945, he was the only surviving member of his family.</p>
<p>During the Holocaust, ghettos like the one in Bialoystok were in the heart of cities just like this memorial.  That meant that beyond the Nazis, everyone in those cities knew that Jews lived there.  They knew the trains were leaving, packed with people day after day.  The evil was visible, but most chose to look away, to do nothing.</p>
<p>This dialogue will help us remember all that can be lost, but also help us to see all that we can save if we choose – if we choose to stand up rather than stand by.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  Thank you very much, Excellency, for these (inaudible) words.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) The German foreign minister now has the floor.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Survivors, ladies and gentlemen, my relationship with this nation’s poignant, painful, and powerful history is hazy.  I will never forget how much I loved the medieval city of Nuremburg, a city that was also the birthplace of the horrifying Nazi racial laws.  I cried privately at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, and I rejoiced after the fact in Germany’s World Cup victory.</p>
<p>The U.S. student Avi Colonomos wrote these words in 2014 when he was 20 years old.  He had come to Berlin with a transatlantic program, Germany Close Up, along with other young Jewish people to learn more about today’s Germany.  What Avi Colonomos describes is the inner conflict that goes hand-in-hand with remembrance.  We are conflicted between tears and joy, conflicted in the face of this history that pains and divides us, just as it moves and unites us in our shared humanity.  And yet understanding where we come from is, despite the sins of inner conflict, the best compass to determine which direction we want to go in.  To borrow the words  of James Baldwin writing in <em>The New York Times</em> in 1962, and I quote, “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”</p>
<p>The 2,710 concrete stelae that make up the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe behind me show us where we Germans come from and what we are responsible for.  The history of murder, horror, and suffering inflicted upon millions of people, incomparable, incontrovertible in its manmade monstrosity here between these stelae, created by the great U.S. architect Peter Eisenman, feelings of profound unease, solitude, grief, responsibility become almost palpable.  Yes, remembrance can be painful.  Yes, remembrance is a test of our mettle and it has to be painful.</p>
<p>And yet we stand here today, side by side, Americans and Germans, Jews, Muslims, Christians and Atheists united in shared remembrance, united by our belief in values such as freedom, democracy, and tolerance, united too in our determination to build a better future on this foundation of values.  That is what Europe is based on and that is what our transatlantic friendship is based on.</p>
<p>Dear Tony, I know how much your family’s personal experiences of the Holocaust influence what you do every day.  You’ve just shared this with us.  On your first day in office as Secretary of State, you said, and I quote, “I remember that the nation’s power isn’t measured only by the size of its military and economy, but by the moral choices it makes,” end of quote.  And the field of stelae behind us is proof of this statement cast in concrete.  America’s power, Germany’s and Europe’s power does not come from glorifying history or glossing over the wrong turns of the past, of which none led into such a terrible abyss as did the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Our strength lies in accepting the burden of historical responsibility unconditionally without drawing a final line.  Our strength lies in joining forces as we search for the best path forward and to do so together, ideally.</p>
<p>And so I am delighted, Dear Tony, that we’re here today in this unique place in the country of the perpetrators to launch a dialogue on Holocaust issues between the United States and Germany.  One of our most pressing tasks will be to prepare our culture of remembrance for changing times.  The memorial foundation with its director, Dr. Uwe Neumarker and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum do outstanding work here every day.  The American Jewish Committee and its director David Harris as well as the Leo Baeck Institute with William Weitzer are also working with us for a lively culture of remembrance.</p>
<p>And I’m grateful for these approaches for their work because I believe that future generations will no longer be able to benefit from personal encounters with contemporary witnesses.  What a great loss.  But at the same time, what a great undertaking for us to find new forms of remembrance which do not allow the stories of individuals to fade from our consciousness.  We owe this to the victims and the survivors, and we’re delighted and honored – dear Margot Friedlander; Mr. Gardosch, dear Peter; and Franz Michalski – that you are with us today.  And we owe it to our children and grandchildren who we want to prevent as far as we can from repeating the errors of the past.</p>
<p>In recent years, we have seen anti-Semitism and racism eating into our societies on both sides of the Atlantic.  Just think of the yellow star badges seen at demonstrations against COVID measures, of the torrent of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on the internet, of the attacks on synagogues and on Jewish people living in our countries, of the rioters in front of the Bundestag, or the rampaging mob in the U.S. Capitol.  The U.S. philosopher, Susan Neiman, president of the Einstein Forum in Potsdam and one of the wisest transatlantic voices in this country gave us a piece of advice some years ago that I believe to be very sage, namely that we must refuse to give evil – and racism and anti-Semitism are nothing other than that – any justification and any weight.  Only through this refusal and not through inaction, silence, or relativization can we subdue the forces that seek to divide our societies.</p>
<p>What we are doing here today will help.  Of course, remembrance is no panacea.  People in societies cannot make peace with their past as easily as that.  It remains a test, a source of inner conflict.  But sharing in remembrance with friends, as we are doing here today, unites us as we face up to this conflict.  And it strengthens us, and above all it strengthens our societies for the future.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>SAUERBREY:</strong>(Via interpreter) Thank you, Minister.  We now turn to the signing of the letter of intent.</li>
</ol>
<p>(The letter of intent is signed.)</p>
<p>And we have two more people to address us now.  First Ms. Margot Friedlander.  She was born in Berlin.  She survived the Holocaust in a number of hiding places until being deported in 1944 to Theresienstadt.  Her father, her mother, her brother, and many other relatives of her were murdered.  Margot Friedlander immigrated to the United States with her husband in 1946 and in 2010 she returned permanently to Berlin.  Ms. Friedlander, thank you for addressing us today.</p>
<p><strong>MS FRIEDLANDER:  </strong>I will tell you a little bit of my experiences.  In mid-January 1943, at about 2:00 p.m., I was on my way home from the factory where I was working (inaudible).  When I approached the house, I noticed a man entering the house.  I did not know him.  Is he waiting for someone?  To be careful, I covered my Jewish star before I was leaving – our apartment door was – happened for him, it is waiting.  I pass him coolly, walk up another floor, and ring the bell of Christian neighbors.  I hardly knew, hoping that they will be home.</p>
<p>I hear steps.  The doors open and the neighbors asked me quietly into the house.  On her face, I see stress, and I feel right away that something has happened.  She asked me into her living room; we both sit down, and she’s – she is telling me time, a few hours ago, she heard noise at the house.  “Open up,” banging on the door, then the clatter at the stairway, and she went to the window.  She saw them come out and rudely pushed them into the police car.  “Whom?” do I ask the neighbor.  “Some people I did not know?”  “The lady, Mrs. Meissner, who also lives in the apartment, and a boy.”</p>
<p>“My brother, Ralph; my mother?”  She tells me my mother was not there.  But one hour after she came home, she found the door locked and (inaudible).  I told her all –  “Where is she now?”  My mother was not waiting for me.  But she left a message with neighbors.  “Tell my daughter, if you should see her, I am going to the police.  I’m going with Ralph, wherever that will be.  Try to make your life.”  With her words, in my mind, I was able to find help and went underground into hiding.</p>
<p>German gentile people I have never seen before, humans, people with character and courage, helped me, who did not look away, but to do something that could have cost their head.  For 15 months, I was hiding with different people.  But in April 1944, my look – my luck ran out.  I was snitched and saw some good fortune.  I was deported to Theresienstadt, where again I was lucky to be able to work in a factory producing the splitting of glimmer that was needed for war effort.  That probably saved me from deportation from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz.  That was the fate of hundred thousands.</p>
<p>In early February 1945, a transport arrived, and with it came Adolf Friedlander.  They came from a special work arrangement near Frankfurt/Oder and because the Russians came closer, they were sent back to Theresienstadt.  I knew Adolf Friedlander years ago in Berlin.  It was so good to meet someone you had known in past life.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) I’ve lost track of where I am, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>(In English) Together, we experience the arrival of a transport in late February, about 10 days before liberation.  I got the assignment to help at the arrival of the train.  As the cattle car door was opened, the people, who were no more human – the masses fell out and were pushed out.  Many were already dead.  Men only, but indistinguishable looking – in striped-looking things like pajamas, but were already tatters.  They wear before Auschwitz was liberated on January 27, 1945, put on the death march for weeks, and the left ones, humans, were put on the cattle cars that now arrived in Theresienstadt, the one camp not liberated at the time.  At the moment I was seeing the masses, I realized I will not ever see my mother and brother again.</p>
<p>Adolf and I experienced the liberation together on the 8th of May, 1945, as, at first, the people who treated us as – left.  The Swiss International Cross came and the Red Cross flag was flying instead of the <em>Hakenkreuz</em>.  About 10 days later, they handed Theresienstadt over to the Russians.  That was on the 8th of May.</p>
<p>Weeks later, sitting on a bench talking to Adolf, he asked me if I could think of starting a life together with him in America, where his sister was living.  We got married on the 28th of June in Theresienstadt, just a day before the last rabbi left Theresienstadt.  One day after our marriage, a cable from his sister arrived, telling him how happy she is that he is alive and expect him in USA.</p>
<p>We left Theresienstadt in early July 1945 and spent one year in a DP camp in Germany before we could leave.  We arrived in July 28th in America.  My husband passed away in December 1997, after almost 53 years of a very special marriage.  We both had the same experience.  We both knew how very special life is.</p>
<p>A few months after my husband had passed away, I was asked to join the senior club of the 92nd Street Y, where my husband was in a leading position for 28 years.  There, many courses were offered, and after more than two years, a writing course started.  I was asked to join.  I was hesitant, but I did.  One night after sleep did not come, the memories, the many memories – I took paper and pen into the bed and started at last to tell my story.</p>
<p>For more than one year, for every course, I did tell the class one more experience, realizing right at the first meeting how very little they knew of these years, almost into my unimaginable happenings what was taking place under the Nazi regime, what humans did, (inaudible).</p>
<p>After living for 57 years in USA, I went for the first time in 2003 to Berlin where I was born and for a visit, and the possibility of planning to make a film, a documentary.  A filmmaker had heard about my story.  He did.  The film was shown in 2005 in Berlin at Jewish Film Festival.  After that, my life took a different turn, because I was asked to write something in German. Always thinking that for 70 years, I live with the messages my mother left for me, “Try to make your life,” I started to write my book.  It was published in Germany by Rowohlt.  It came out in (inaudible) with the title of the words my mother left for me, <em>Try To Make Your Life</em>.  In German, <em>Versuche, dein Leben zu machen</em>.</p>
<p>Right now, I came very often to Berlin because right at the start, I was asked to give readings in schools, bookstores, but many different places.  I talked – well, in cities in Germany, always finding that the students are most attentive, interested to talk to me, to ask questions, and want to know more about what my life is now after much (inaudible) experiences.  In 2009, I got surprise in German for the book as the best autobiography.  In July of 2009, I came to Berlin and stayed for seven months, having such wonderful experiences, meeting fine people.</p>
<p>People thank me for doing what now became my mission.  I often give two or three readings a week, again traveling to many cities.  I was reading always for one hour very special pages from the book, and telling to whom I spoke what I want them to do, what I do, because we will not be on with a life many – much longer, and it is for them that it should never happen again, that I don’t want anyone to experience what has been done to the 5 million Jews and millions of other innocent humans.</p>
<p>I tell them that there is no Christian, Jewish, or Muslim blood – that there’s only human blood.  We are all the same, that people did it because they did not respect humans.  Please, be a human being.</p>
<p>In 2010 I did return to Berlin for good, and never did I regret it for one moment.  And here I am and gold still – it’s now almost hundred years to talk to people.  It is for you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Thank you, Ms. Friedlander, for your words, for everything you have done for Holocaust remembrance and for everything you continue to do.  Margo Wieseler, 25 years old, will speak to us now.  She served as a volunteer at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center in Chicago, Illinois, Skokie.</p>
<p><strong>MS WIESELER:</strong>  Good morning.  Again, I would just really like to thank Ms. Friedlander.  Your words really shook me in a way I didn’t even expect, although I expected it to be emotional, but yeah.  So thank you very much, and your words of wisdom and passion are truly an inspiring call to action for my generation.</p>
<p>I also want to thank Secretary Blinken and Secretary Maas for highlighting innovative ways to commemorate the Holocaust.  Initiatives to preserve the voices of our survivors are essential to prevent my generation from choosing the ease of forgetting over the pain or the shame of remembering.  And sometimes standard high-school-level history education can sadly reinforce this tendency, as it can make the Holocaust feel unpersonal and much more distant than it is.</p>
<p>I myself only recently really started confronting my family history and involvement when I began to prepare for my year abroad with <em>Aktion Suhnezeichen Friedensdienste</em>.  <em>Aktion Suhnezeichen</em> is a German NGO aiding reconciliation between victims of Nazi persecution and young Germans today.  And with the help of them, I had the unique opportunity and great privilege to spend a year volunteering at the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center, a world-leading institution in the field of digitalized Holocaust remembrance in Chicago.</p>
<p>So – and I did find my motivation for serving in the museum in my family history.  My great grandfather was a member of the Reichstag, appointed by the Nazi party.  I was, still am, and will always be ashamed of this piece of my family’s history, and I was especially anxious to share this with the survivors and their families.  They had every reason to be dismissive, hurt, or even hostile towards me, but to my great relief their response was full of love, understanding, and even curiosity towards me and my motivations.</p>
<p>This ability to distinguish between my generation and our ancestors left a lasting impression on me.  I was especially amazed by Fritzie Fritzshall, the museum’s longtime president and a teenage survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau, who heavily accepted an invitation to dinner from me and a friend.  And the cuisine would be German, obviously.</p>
<p>In devastating news, Fritzie sadly died last weekend, leaving another hole that will never be filled.  However, her impressing ability to disband black-and-white thinking in place of a more nuanced approach is, I think, something I learned from and everybody else can do.</p>
<p>My generation, young as we are, has been fortunate enough to hear the stories of the Holocaust directly from survivors, reminding us just how recent these atrocities truly were.  Because they were – they did happen before our lifetimes.  With each passing day, preserving and retelling these lessons gets more important, lest we begin to distance ourselves and forget the lessons learned.</p>
<p>My year with <em>Aktion Suhnezeichen </em>has forever changed me, and I can confidently say that I understand the importance of combating anti-Semitism and using that voice to fight for a free and fair society better than before.  If young people like me sincerely want to make “Never again” or “<em>Nie wieder</em>” a reality, we must never stop openly building bridges between the most painful hours of the past, our lives today, and the future we wish to see.</p>
<p>Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS SAUERBREY:</strong>  (Via interpreter) Thank you, Ms. Wieseler.  Ladies and gentlemen, the foreign ministers will now place a wreath on the Memorial to the Murdered Jews in Europe, and will then speak to the survivors who are with us today: Ms. Margot Friedlander, Peter Gardosch, and Franz Michalski.  Ms. Wieseler and a number of Anne Frank ambassadors are also here, peer guides and volunteers of the Anne Frank Center in Berlin.  Afterwards, this ceremony is concluded.  And I would like to use this opportunity to thank you on behalf of the foreign office and the U.S. Department of State for having come here.  Have a safe journey home.  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

<p><em>“President Macron and I stand together, ready to take on the toughest challenges we face.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><em>– President Biden, June 11, 2021</em></p>
<p>Secretary Antony J. Blinken will travel to Paris, France, June 24-27, 2021, where he will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and French Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian.  During this trip to engage with the United States’ oldest Ally, Secretary Blinken will emphasize the importance of maintaining Transatlantic cooperation, addressing our joint response to the ongoing health crisis, tackling the climate crisis, and highlighting the strength of our longstanding bilateral partnership.</p>
<p><strong>The United States and France are Close Allies</strong></p>
<p>France is America’s oldest friend and Ally.  Our relationship is built upon our shared commitment to the same values – democracy, human rights, the rule of law, security, and prosperity.  The closeness of our military, economic, and political cooperation form the basis of our enduring partnership.</p>
<p>The United States has counted on France as a close partner since the very foundation of our country.  We remember Gilbert du Mortier, Marquis de Lafayette, and Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, Comte de Rochambeau, as heroes of the American Revolution.  France came to the aid of our young country; the United States has not forgotten.</p>
<p>In 2021, we commemorated the 77th anniversary of D-Day and the sacrifices made on the beaches of Normandy.  As NATO Allies, France and the United States have built and sustained the post-war global order, which promotes freedom and prosperity.  Our joint commitment to shared Transatlantic values has brought us 77 years of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p><strong>Confronting Global Challenges: The United States Counts on France as a Partner</strong></p>
<p>Today’s global challenges underscore the importance of strong partnerships.  Security, economic, and cultural cooperation form the basis of our bilateral relationship.  France is a key NATO Ally and an important bilateral economic partner.  France will assume the presidency of the Council of the European Union in January 2022, and we look forward to working with France to revitalize and raise the level of ambition in the United States’ partnership with the EU.</p>
<p>Security cooperation underpins our bilateral relationship.  France remains a steadfast partner in the fight against terrorism, as both a member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and through its counterterrorism leadership in the Sahel.  Around the world, we look to France as a partner in global security.</p>
<p>The United States and France agree on the need to hold Russia accountable for its aggressive and destabilizing activities, including in Ukraine.  France is a partner in standing up to Russia’s attempts to undermine democratic systems.</p>
<p>We coordinate with France on issues like human rights, economic coercion, and corruption, to amplify our voices and combat the PRC’s attempts to erode the values and institutions that undergird the rules-based international order.</p>
<p>The United States is dedicated to raising global climate ambitions. In the lead up to COP26, we will continue to work with France in implementing climate finance to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and accelerating the transition to a clean energy economy to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century.</p>
<p><strong>The Thriving Bilateral Economic Relationship Supports Our Workers</strong></p>
<p>The United States and France share a deep trade and investment relationship.  France is the United States’ third largest trading partner in Europe with $99.7 billion of goods and services traded in 2020.  The United States is the top destination for French investment and the United States is the largest foreign investor in France.  In total, we have invested more than $394 billion in each other&#8217;s economies.  The 4,800 French firms in the United States support 780,000 jobs, while the 4,500 U.S. firms in France support nearly 500,000 jobs.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the United States and France share concerns about the health of our citizens as we seek to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and ensure equitable access to vaccines.  The United States and France have both committed to share vaccine doses through COVAX and will continue to support global vaccination efforts.  We must work together to safely restore global travel and trade on a sustainable basis, and the United States looks forward to partnering with France to increase global preparedness to better prevent and respond to future outbreaks.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Historical and Cultural Ties Cement Our People-to-People Bonds </strong></p>
<p>The enduring relationship between our two countries is apparent in our historical connection and people-to-people ties.  France and the United States share a strong commitment to educational exchanges.  Before the coronavirus pandemic, approximately18,000 Americans studied abroad in France each year, making France among the top four most popular study abroad destinations for American students.  French students are also attracted to educational exchange opportunities in the United States.  In the 2019/2020 academic year, 8,471 French students chose to study at a U.S. college or university.   Although COVID-19 has forced many of our exchange programs to pause this year, interest in exchanges remains strong, and we will make every effort to ensure that these exchanges between our two countries not only continue but grow.</p>
<p>Established in 1948, the U.S.-French Fulbright program is one of the oldest Fulbright programs in the world.  Every year, approximately 160 French and American students, scholars, teaching assistants, and higher education administrators receive Fulbright awards to study, teach, and conduct research.  Since its inception, the program has supported approximately 30,000 individual Fulbright exchanges between the United States and France and will celebrate its 75th anniversary in 2023.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>I would like to congratulate law professor Gay McDougall on her election as an independent expert to serve on the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).  Advancing racial equity and justice is a top priority for the United States, and in our pursuit of those ideals at home and around the world, the United States was proud to nominate her to serve a third term on the Committee.</p>
<p>The Committee is an important UN platform for addressing global systemic racism.  It is charged with the critical work of monitoring 182 States parties’ compliance with their treaty obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).  The United States takes our ICERD treaty obligations seriously and submitted our outstanding reports to the CERD Committee on June 2.</p>
<p>Professor McDougall is a globally acclaimed expert in international human rights law, a Fordham University law professor, and will serve as a principled and independent voice on the Committee.  She has successfully served on this Committee in the past, and I am confident she will continue to bring the important perspective of American jurisprudence towards the goal of eliminating global and systemic racism.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany </p>
<p>Clärchens Ballhaus</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Welcome, everyone, for our session today on the transatlantic relations.  I’m very happy that Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Maas could join us today.</p>
<p>Again, in German.</p>
<p>(Via interpreter) So first of all, I’d like to say, first of all, thank you and a very, very warm welcome to all of you.  I’m so happy that first, Foreign Minister Maas, and also Secretary of State Blinken are here.  It’s great that we have the opportunity to speak with them.  I’d like to give them the chance to speak.</p>
<p>Mr. Minister Maas, you have three minutes for brief remarks for – on German foreign policy and transatlantic relations.  Three minutes, they belong to you, and then we will pass the baton onto Secretary of State Blinken.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MAAS:</strong>  (Via interpreter) A word of welcome also on my behalf.  We are delighted to have the opportunity to not only talk to those people we tend to meet regularly – ministers, politicians – but to meet with people like you.  We are dying to hear your questions.  Please be courageous.  We are willing to take any questions you might have.  I really enjoy something like this, especially as the perspective of us being given a glass of beer is there visible on the horizon.  Why are you giving me a large one?  (Laughter.)  Bad news, bad press coverage.  And that this takes place in a location like this – those who know Berlin know Clarchens Ballhaus, and I am pleased that Tony accepted to have this here.  This is not the classical Berlin style.</p>
<p>So as I said, we look forward to having your questions.  And I don’t want to be too long.  I’ll just share a story with you, if I may, Tony.  From the very first telephone conversation we had after Tony took the office of Secretary of State, at the end of the telephone call I couldn’t help myself by saying Tony, I still have to get used to the fact that I can speak to the American Foreign Secretary and always be of the same view because that used to be different beforehand.</p>
<p>This is important for the bilateral relationship between Germany and the United States.  The election of Joe Biden is a genuine game-changer for international politics, the biggest for quite a while – for many years indeed as long as I have been following events in the field of foreign policy because you once said diplomacy is back, and I think the President also said that diplomacy is back, the United States are back on the international stage.  And that is really something that we missed for quite a while – transatlantic partnership, yes, indeed.</p>
<p>I think we have to have the same objectives, and that has improved as far as that situation is concerned.  And I think this is to do with the fact that we are linked by the same values.  We share the same values: democracy, freedom, rule of law.  And I believe that that is what the vast majority of the people on this globe actually wants to have as the foundation of their lives, and that is what links us.  I think that is what brings us together and what we have in common, Europe and North America.  And the times we are experiencing is the place to be.</p>
<p>Okay, let me give you one example, a somewhat problematic one.  When we look to the flows of migration we are confronted with, the people who want to come to Europe, why do they want to come to Europe?  I know about few people – migrants who are heading in the direction of China or Moscow.  They’re coming to us.  And the same is true for the United States when you look to Latin America – South America – they are heading in your direction, your way, and towards Canada.  And that is a clear indication of the fact that this is what the people are looking for: democracy, liberal societies, freedoms, and respect for the rights of minorities too.  These are the values that we share.</p>
<p>And if you share that set of values, it’s not that difficult also to define the same objectives.  And it is now about how we can cooperate in order to achieve these objectives.  And we are cooperating.  In the past, this hasn’t been the case often enough when you look to Russia and to China.  We won’t be able to achieve as much as we would if the United States and Europe were to pursue the same strategy; we would be playing in the same camp, so to speak.  And that is or has become obvious over the last few months – the same objectives, the same set of values.</p>
<p>And every – whenever this cooperation takes place, G7, G20, we are heading for a G20 ministerial meeting at the end of – at the beginning of next week – we’ll have to unite our forces in order to protect what is important to us, the values that – our foundation and our political sphere, but also those that we want to have as a foundation for our everyday life.  They need to be protected and to be upheld day in, day out.  And if that is possible, I think then it should be possible also to make sure that they are upheld in other parts of the world too.</p>
<p>So as I said, I’m delighted that we’re back here.  We need the United States.  And yeah, I want to be quite open because it sounds so political what I’ve been saying so far.  It’s more fun too.  I’m being very honest.  We had President Trump, then we had the virus.  It has made matters extremely complicated.  I now hope that we will overcome the virus too.  We have so many things in common.  And I think there is such a great degree of readiness and willingness on both sides of the Atlantic to cooperate.  So I look forward to that.</p>
<p>Minister, thank you very much indeed.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Welcome to Berlin, the transatlantic relations and the focus today.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, first, it’s wonderful to be with all of you.  And I’ve got to say, Heiko, as much as I love the foreign ministry and as much as the chancellor’s office is extraordinary, this is a pretty good place to have a conversation.  And I asked for the smaller one.  They were going to give me a larger one, but cheers, first of all.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  A couple of things.  First of all, it’s wonderful to see all of you, and I’m really looking forward to hearing from you and talking to you.  I have a deep personal affection for Germany that goes back many years.  I had the great experience and good fortune after being born in New York and living in New York until I was nine years old and moving when I was nine to Paris, and my closest friends in school in Paris were both, as it turned out, German – both when I first got there when I was nine, ten years old, and then later another good friend who was my closest friend through high school.  And we were in a band together.  He was actually talented, unlike me.  (Laughter.)  But we – one spring break we took a road trip, and we drove from Paris to Hamburg, and we – maybe we thought we were going to be like the Beatles when they spent time in Hamburg and then they got famous afterward.  That didn’t happen.</p>
<p>But I have wonderful memories of getting to Hamburg.  And it was a holiday weekend, and we were at a place not unlike this in Hamburg, and the band that was supposed to play that weekend was unable to do it, and it was a holiday weekend.  And my friend said, well, we’re a band, and they said oh, all right, come back tomorrow and play a few songs, and if you’re even – if you’re any good, we’ll let you play over the holiday weekend.  And we had another member of the band with us on this road trip, and we met up with a couple of my German friends – his name was Carsten Gerlach – Carsten’s friends who lived – were still living in Hamburg, who were actually very good musicians.  We practiced all morning, went to the bar at night, the late afternoon, played a few songs.  They said, well, not great but it’s better than having no band.  (Laughter.)  And we played for the – we played all of the shows for the weekend.  I think we were underage, but don’t tell anyone.  (Laughter.)  Anyway, I have extremely warm and strong and long memories of being in Germany and having very close friends.</p>
<p>But I want to pick up where Heiko left off, because as in so many things, we’re in violent agreement.  We have such powerful connections between our countries – the work that our – the governments are doing together, but in a sense even more important, just the connections between our people.  So many generations of Americans who have German ancestry; student-to-student, young people-to-young people exchanges that most of you are involved with; our scientists, including on COVID and bio and tech, for example, working together; businesses.  It’s powerful and it’s deep.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure in my small way that that endures and maybe even grows stronger.  And there are a number of important reasons for that, but it’s really what Heiko was saying that’s most important:  When you think about the problems that we have to deal with, the challenges that we face that are actually having an impact on our lives, your lives, my life, the life of our fellow citizens, whether it’s this pandemic, whether it’s climate change, whether it’s the way new technologies are changing our lives, whether it’s migration, I think the one thing we strongly agree on and believe together is that there’s not a single one of those big things that are having an impact that any one country can effectively deal with alone.  And there is no wall high enough or wide enough to prevent some of the problems that result.</p>
<p>So I think almost more than any time in my life, there is an imperative, a need, for countries to cooperate, to work together.  And the natural thing is when you have the same basic values, that brings you together in cooperation, but it doesn’t just happen; you have to work at it.  And we have – and sometimes we have differences of approach, tactics, et cetera, but the fundamentals are very, very strong.  And I think what so many of you are doing, especially in creating experiences, creating friendships, creating networks even with Americans, with Germans, these kinds of connections are exactly the way going forward we’re going to find ways to cooperate and deal together with the challenges that we face.</p>
<p>We both know that our responsibility in whatever way we can is to try to demonstrate that our countries, our democracies – that’s what joins us in terms of values – that we can actually produce results that – whether it’s a problem or an opportunity, we can help address it.  If we can’t do that, we are not going to have a lot of confidence of the people that we represent.  If we can do that, that’s how you make progress.  And you are all very much a part of that idea.  This can’t happen without the connections that you’re making, without the – I think the – hopefully the cooperation and work that you’ll do with people, not just United States and Germany, but across Europe and across the world.  It’s never been more important, and so I’m really glad to have this opportunity to exchange some ideas and to hear from you what you’re thinking about, what concerns you, because we have to be able to meet the things that are shaping your lives, that you care about, that you see as having an impact for good or for bad on your futures.  That’s our responsibility, but we need to know that we’re actually focused on the right thing.</p>
<p>And it’s – we talked about having an event with young people, and I said, “Oh, I don’t feel that old.”  (Laughter.)  But it really does make a big, big difference because – I won’t speak for Heiko, but you get to a certain age, and as much as you try to have an open mind, you can get set in your ways, in your viewpoint, in the way you approach things.  And it’s so important for me, for us, to hear from people from different backgrounds, different experiences, different generations.  So thank you for being here today.  (Applause.)</p>

<p>And if you share that set of values, it’s not that difficult also to define the same objectives.  And it is now about how we can cooperate in order to achieve these objectives.  And we are cooperating.  In the past, this hasn’t been the case often enough when you look to Russia and to China.  We won’t be able to achieve as much as we would if the United States and Europe were to pursue the same strategy; we would be playing in the same camp, so to speak.  And that is or has become obvious over the last few months – the same objectives, the same set of values.</p>
<p>And every – whenever this cooperation takes place, G7, G20, we are heading for a G20 ministerial meeting at the end of – at the beginning of next week – we’ll have to unite our forces in order to protect what is important to us, the values that – our foundation and our political sphere, but also those that we want to have as a foundation for our everyday life.  They need to be protected and to be upheld day in, day out.  And if that is possible, I think then it should be possible also to make sure that they are upheld in other parts of the world too.</p>
<p>So as I said, I’m delighted that we’re back here.  We need the United States.  And yeah, I want to be quite open because it sounds so political what I’ve been saying so far.  It’s more fun too.  I’m being very honest.  We had President Trump, then we had the virus.  It has made matters extremely complicated.  I now hope that we will overcome the virus too.  We have so many things in common.  And I think there is such a great degree of readiness and willingness on both sides of the Atlantic to cooperate.  So I look forward to that.</p>
<p>Minister, thank you very much indeed.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Welcome to Berlin, the transatlantic relations and the focus today.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, first, it’s wonderful to be with all of you.  And I’ve got to say, Heiko, as much as I love the foreign ministry and as much as the chancellor’s office is extraordinary, this is a pretty good place to have a conversation.  And I asked for the smaller one.  They were going to give me a larger one, but cheers, first of all.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  A couple of things.  First of all, it’s wonderful to see all of you, and I’m really looking forward to hearing from you and talking to you.  I have a deep personal affection for Germany that goes back many years.  I had the great experience and good fortune after being born in New York and living in New York until I was nine years old and moving when I was nine to Paris, and my closest friends in school in Paris were both, as it turned out, German – both when I first got there when I was nine, ten years old, and then later another good friend who was my closest friend through high school.  And we were in a band together.  He was actually talented, unlike me.  (Laughter.)  But we – one spring break we took a road trip, and we drove from Paris to Hamburg, and we – maybe we thought we were going to be like the Beatles when they spent time in Hamburg and then they got famous afterward.  That didn’t happen.</p>
<p>But I have wonderful memories of getting to Hamburg.  And it was a holiday weekend, and we were at a place not unlike this in Hamburg, and the band that was supposed to play that weekend was unable to do it, and it was a holiday weekend.  And my friend said, well, we’re a band, and they said oh, all right, come back tomorrow and play a few songs, and if you’re even – if you’re any good, we’ll let you play over the holiday weekend.  And we had another member of the band with us on this road trip, and we met up with a couple of my German friends – his name was Carsten Gerlach – Carsten’s friends who lived – were still living in Hamburg, who were actually very good musicians.  We practiced all morning, went to the bar at night, the late afternoon, played a few songs.  They said, well, not great but it’s better than having no band.  (Laughter.)  And we played for the – we played all of the shows for the weekend.  I think we were underage, but don’t tell anyone.  (Laughter.)  Anyway, I have extremely warm and strong and long memories of being in Germany and having very close friends.</p>
<p>But I want to pick up where Heiko left off, because as in so many things, we’re in violent agreement.  We have such powerful connections between our countries – the work that our – the governments are doing together, but in a sense even more important, just the connections between our people.  So many generations of Americans who have German ancestry; student-to-student, young people-to-young people exchanges that most of you are involved with; our scientists, including on COVID and bio and tech, for example, working together; businesses.  It’s powerful and it’s deep.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure in my small way that that endures and maybe even grows stronger.  And there are a number of important reasons for that, but it’s really what Heiko was saying that’s most important:  When you think about the problems that we have to deal with, the challenges that we face that are actually having an impact on our lives, your lives, my life, the life of our fellow citizens, whether it’s this pandemic, whether it’s climate change, whether it’s the way new technologies are changing our lives, whether it’s migration, I think the one thing we strongly agree on and believe together is that there’s not a single one of those big things that are having an impact that any one country can effectively deal with alone.  And there is no wall high enough or wide enough to prevent some of the problems that result.</p>
<p>So I think almost more than any time in my life, there is an imperative, a need, for countries to cooperate, to work together.  And the natural thing is when you have the same basic values, that brings you together in cooperation, but it doesn’t just happen; you have to work at it.  And we have – and sometimes we have differences of approach, tactics, et cetera, but the fundamentals are very, very strong.  And I think what so many of you are doing, especially in creating experiences, creating friendships, creating networks even with Americans, with Germans, these kinds of connections are exactly the way going forward we’re going to find ways to cooperate and deal together with the challenges that we face.</p>
<p>We both know that our responsibility in whatever way we can is to try to demonstrate that our countries, our democracies – that’s what joins us in terms of values – that we can actually produce results that – whether it’s a problem or an opportunity, we can help address it.  If we can’t do that, we are not going to have a lot of confidence of the people that we represent.  If we can do that, that’s how you make progress.  And you are all very much a part of that idea.  This can’t happen without the connections that you’re making, without the – I think the – hopefully the cooperation and work that you’ll do with people, not just United States and Germany, but across Europe and across the world.  It’s never been more important, and so I’m really glad to have this opportunity to exchange some ideas and to hear from you what you’re thinking about, what concerns you, because we have to be able to meet the things that are shaping your lives, that you care about, that you see as having an impact for good or for bad on your futures.  That’s our responsibility, but we need to know that we’re actually focused on the right thing.</p>
<p>And it’s – we talked about having an event with young people, and I said, “Oh, I don’t feel that old.”  (Laughter.)  But it really does make a big, big difference because – I won’t speak for Heiko, but you get to a certain age, and as much as you try to have an open mind, you can get set in your ways, in your viewpoint, in the way you approach things.  And it’s so important for me, for us, to hear from people from different backgrounds, different experiences, different generations.  So thank you for being here today.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>U.S. Embassy Berlin</p>
<p><strong>MS QUINVILLE:    </strong>Mr. Secretary, here and virtually, you have the community of mighty Mission Germany.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>All right.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>MS QUINVILLE:  </strong>This is our embassy and five consulates in Hamburg, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, and Leipzig.  We are 1,700 strong.  We are Americans from across our government.  We are Germans and folks from around the world who are resident here in Berlin and elsewhere in Germany.  We are creative, committed, energetic, and flexible.  In a crisis, we bend but never break.</p>
<p>When COVID hit, we knew it was going to define us as a community, so we were generous with each other.  We shifted to a mix of home office and in-office work with remarkable grace.  We accidentally met families and pets during our Zoom meetings, and we forgave each other our worst hair days.  For the 16 months of sometimes-tough-to-take lockdown, we have stood six feet apart and still supported each other.  And you will not find a better team to power our policy.  So I am proud to be part of this extraordinary group.</p>
<p>Now, for mighty Mission Germany, please welcome Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  (Applause.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you all so very, very much.  Robin, I think you&#8217;ve summed it up better than I could.  I&#8217;ve heard about mighty Mission Germany.  Now I get to see mighty Mission Germany here on the screen, and to hear it also in your words.  I am so grateful to have everyone or have so many of you together in this room, to get to meet face to face or maybe mask to mask, depending.</p>
<p>And I just can&#8217;t begin to tell you how proud I am of the work that you&#8217;ve been doing, the way that you&#8217;ve been doing it in a time of tremendous, tremendous challenge.  And to your point, Robin, I think what we&#8217;ve seen here – and I&#8217;ve got to tell you, what we&#8217;ve seen in our missions around the world that I&#8217;ve had the privilege in these past couple of months to visit – we have seen exactly what you described, which is our teams, our people coming together, and six feet apart but standing together, continuing the work that you’re entrusted with.  And I am truly grateful for that.</p>
<p>There are few more important places to be doing that then right here in Germany.  I said yesterday that it&#8217;s hard to think of a better friend or a stronger partner to the United States.  And we need those strong partners and those good friends.  Everything that we&#8217;re doing on behalf of our fellow citizens back home, the challenges that they face, the things that are going to have a real impact on their lives, we can&#8217;t do it alone, certainly not as effectively.</p>
<p>And whether it&#8217;s the big issues of our time like dealing with this pandemic, climate change, disruptive impact of technology, to smaller day-in/day-out things, we know that even the United States can&#8217;t get the job done alone, that we benefit profoundly from working in coordination and cooperation with others.  And to me, it&#8217;s a tremendous sense of strength and comfort to know that we have such a strong, committed partner in Germany.  And that partnership, the day-in/day-out work of making it strong, building it, keeping it resilient – that&#8217;s exactly what all of you, each and every one of you, is doing every single day.  And I couldn&#8217;t be more grateful for that.</p>
<p>We had a short but very, very good visit here in these last 24-plus hours, including a very, very productive meeting with Chancellor Merkel that I&#8217;m grateful for, a lot of time with my friend and a wonderful person, Heiko Maas, the foreign minister.  You all saw that we took part of the important conference that Germany brought together on Libya and its future.  And just now, just across the street, we launched the U.S.-Germany Dialogue on Holocaust Issues.  That, in just a small way, captures the incredible breadth as well as the depth of what we&#8217;re doing together.</p>
<p>Robin, I know you are heading back home in just a few days, and I just want to salute your remarkable leadership these last 16 months at this mission.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  With your very dynamic DCM, I think you&#8217;ve demonstrated what an incredibly powerful duo can do and get done with the remarkable team here at Mission Germany.</p>
<p>I do want to spend one more second just on the resilience that all of you showed during COVID. We are getting to the end of it.  I know we’ve had – continue to have ups and downs, but we&#8217;re getting there.  But I have some feeling and understanding for what these months of lockdowns and being closed in and quarantined and other restrictions have meant.  And again, I just want to say thank you for doing, in so many different ways, big and small, what it took to keep morale high, to keep the mission going, to keep working on behalf of the American people, to take care of Americans here in Germany, just to keep the work of this mission going.</p>
<p>I heard about a couple of things that just struck me.  And, again, we&#8217;re – when we&#8217;re doing a lot of this work we sometimes are talking in terms of big high-policy issues and strategic matters of one kind or another.  But the human things have such a powerful impact too.  So the mass community outreach initiative that I heard about handmade more than a thousand cloth masks donated to hospitals, to eldercare facilities, to refugee camps, to the Ronald McDonald House.  I can&#8217;t begin to tell you how even that kind of gesture has a lasting, profound impact on people.  That&#8217;s the human connection that you&#8217;re also making every single day.</p>
<p>Now, maybe on a more challenging note, I know that you&#8217;ve waited just a little bit for the completion of the annex renovations.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>MS QUINVILLE:  </strong>Yeah.  Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>I know I’m treading on dangerous territory, but this is a major endeavor.  I think it’s demanded two things: patience and you mentioned flexibility – well, there’s another example of it, but I think well worth the wait.  New fitness facilities, basketball court, a satellite health office, beautiful community spaces – I hope, indeed, well worth the wait.</p>
<p>Let me close with this:  Whether you are a direct hire, Foreign Service Officer, civil servant; whether you&#8217;re working with one of our many partner agencies, departments; whether you&#8217;re a family member; whether you&#8217;re locally employed staff – we count on each and every one of you to keep this relationship strong, to keep it vital, to keep it going, to do the work that is so important to our fellow citizens.  And let me just say to the locally employed staff, very simply, thank you. You are the lifeblood of this mission.  You&#8217;re the lifeblood of missions everywhere around the world.  The real connectivity between our communities, you&#8217;re bringing that every single day.  I know that a number of you are here in this room.  I&#8217;m grateful to you on behalf of the United States.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve – we&#8217;re getting to the – I think the end of a challenging period.  We have lots of other challenges that we have to grapple with every single day.  When I get a chance to see each and every one of you, it gives me incredible hope.  It gives me incredible confidence, conviction that we&#8217;re going to meet the tests and challenges of our time.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
