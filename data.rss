<p>The below is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke today with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba to reinforce the United States’ steadfast commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We are resolved to continue to provide security, economic, and humanitarian support to the government and people of Ukraine as they defend against President Putin’s brutal and unprovoked war. Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Kuleba discussed the most recent Presidential Drawdown for an additional $800 million for weapons, ammunition, and other security assistance for Ukraine’s defense. They noted that the steady supply of materiel from the United States and its Allies and partners has been instrumental in Ukraine’s successful fight against Russia’s forces. The Secretary provided an update on the most recent U.S. and global efforts to hold the Kremlin and its enablers accountable. The Secretary commended the bravery of the Ukrainian people, noting in particular those defending Mariupol.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announced today it will host a virtual panel discussion on gender equity in sport on Monday, April 18 at 12:00 p.m. EDT, as part of its year-long programming around the 50th anniversary of Title IX, the United States’ landmark legislation that afforded equal opportunity for women in education and sport.</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs Lee Satterfield will join sports icon and equality champion Billie Jean King, International Tennis Federation Vice President Katrina Adams, and award-winning filmmaker Dawn Porter for a conversation with embassies and audiences from around the world to share their perspectives on gender and racial equity, visibility and representation, and inclusion in and through sports.</p>
<p>Watch the live panel discussion online at: <a class="external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/SportsDiplomacyDivision" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">Facebook.com/SportsDiplomacyDivision.</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a></p>
<p>About the panelists: Billie Jean King, the first female athlete to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom and who LIFE magazine named one of the “100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Century,” will headline the panel with Katrina Adams, Vice President of the International Tennis Federation. Ms. Adams was the first African American to lead the United States Tennis Association (USTA), the first two term Chairman and President of USTA, and the first former player to hold that honor. The panel will be moderated by Dawn Porter, an award-winning documentary filmmaker and executive producer of the film 37 Words for ESPN’s initiative Fifty/50, an in-depth look at the progress and challenges associated with Title IX implementation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><span>Today, the White House released the U.S. Department of State’s Equity Action Plan to implement Executive Order (E.O.) 13985 on <em>Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government</em>.  On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued E.O. 13985 directing the federal government to take comprehensive action in policymaking and operations to address racial equity and barriers to opportunity for underserved communities.  E.O. 13985 also mandated every federal agency develop an Equity Action Plan outlining its implementation efforts. </span><span>Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Brian P. McKeon has led the enterprise-wide implementation of E.O. 13985 for the U.S. Department of State.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The U.S. Department of State’s Equity Action Plan targets five priority areas for embedding equity into foreign affairs work: (1) foreign policy development and implementation, (2) foreign assistance, (3) public diplomacy, (4) consular services, and (5) procurement, contracts, and grants.  The Equity Action Plan outlines specific actions, metrics, and accountability efforts to successfully integrate E.O. 13985 into the U.S. Department of State’s foreign affairs mission.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Inequity is a national security challenge with global consequences. The systematic exclusion of individuals from historically marginalized and vulnerable groups from full participation in economic, social, and civic life impedes equity globally, while fueling corruption, economic migration, distrust, and authoritarianism. That is why the Administration pledged to “defend and protect human rights and address discrimination, inequity, and marginalization in all its forms” in its interim national security strategy. It is also why President Biden on his first day in office directed his Administration to take comprehensive action to address barriers to opportunity for underserved communities with Executive Order (E.O.) 13985 on <em>Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government</em>. This E.O. mandated every federal agency produce an Equity Action Plan outlining its implementation efforts.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Deputy Secretary of State Brian P. McKeon has led the Department’s implementation of the E.O., and today, the White House released our Equity Action Plan to implement the E.O. In the coming months, we will also establish a Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice to continue operationalizing this E.O. across our foreign affairs work.</p>
<p>We know that embedding equity across our foreign affairs work will raise the visibility of racial and other inequities globally and generate better-informed foreign policies to decrease barriers to equity and equality worldwide. This Equity Action Plan identifies ways to successfully integrate the E.O. into our externally-facing efforts, such as diplomatic engagements, high-level dialogues, multilateral efforts, foreign assistance, public diplomacy and exchanges, procurement and contracts, and more.</p>
<p>The Department is committed to the principle of equity across all of our programs and policies, and the plan released today will serve as our blueprint for achieving that goal.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>I extend my congratulations to Jim O’Brien, who began serving this week after his confirmation by the Senate as the Department’s Head of the Office of Sanctions Coordination with the rank of Ambassador.  Ambassador O’Brien brings decades of foreign policy experience to this role, having held senior positions at the Department and in the private sector.</p>
<p>The new Office of Sanctions Coordination will oversee work on sanctions and further strengthen cooperation with allies and partners in the use of this critical tool.  It will also promote accountability for corruption and human rights abuse and deter and disrupt activities that threaten our national security.</p>
<p>This is a critical office at a critical time, and I am confident Ambassador O’Brien and his team will serve the Department and the American people extraordinarily well.</p>

<p>I extend my congratulations to Jim O’Brien, who began serving this week after his confirmation by the Senate as the Department’s Head of the Office of Sanctions Coordination with the rank of Ambassador.  Ambassador O’Brien brings decades of foreign policy experience to this role, having held senior positions at the Department and in the private sector.</p>
<p>The new Office of Sanctions Coordination will oversee work on sanctions and further strengthen cooperation with allies and partners in the use of this critical tool.  It will also promote accountability for corruption and human rights abuse and deter and disrupt activities that threaten our national security.</p>
<p>This is a critical office at a critical time, and I am confident Ambassador O’Brien and his team will serve the Department and the American people extraordinarily well.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Against tremendous odds, with extraordinary courage, and in the face of Russia’s relentless brutality against civilians, Ukraine’s forces are regaining ground, as Russian forces retreat from Kyiv and the surrounding region.  Still, Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, unjustified, and brutal war against Ukraine is far from over.  Russia is repositioning its forces for renewed attacks in eastern and southern Ukraine.  The United States, its Allies and partners must take action now to surge additional military assistance as Ukraine prepares for the next phase in the fight for its freedom and its very future.</p>
<p>I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation from the President earlier today, a drawdown to provide immediate military assistance to Ukraine valued at up to $800 million.  This authorization is the seventh drawdown of arms, equipment, and supplies from Department of Defense inventories for Ukraine since August 2021.  This new package features a host of additional capabilities in response to the Ukrainian Government’s requests, including artillery, armored vehicles, helicopters, and Unmanned Coastal Defense Vessels, as well as engineering and field support equipment, in addition to supplementing anti-armor and anti-personnel capabilities, counter artillery, and air defense radars, tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, body armor, and combat medical equipment.</p>
<p>Today’s authorization will bring the total U.S. security assistance commitment to Ukraine to more than $3.2 billion since the beginning of this Administration, and more than $2.5 billion since the beginning of Russia’s brutal assault against Ukraine began on February 24.  In addition to what we have provided, more than 30 countries have joined us to deliver security assistance to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began.  Together, we are working around the clock to deliver security assistance every day, and we are expediting shipments of even more of the arms and defense equipment Ukraine needs to defend itself.</p>
<p>We remain in close contact with Ukraine and are supportive of President Zelenskyy’s commitment to engage in diplomacy that leads to Russia stopping its attacks and withdrawing its forces.  We are focused on putting Ukraine in the strongest possible negotiating position by continuing to provide security assistance to help Ukraine defend itself and by increasing pressure on Putin by imposing severe costs on Russia.  We and our Allies and partners will continue to provide security assistance, humanitarian aid, and economic support to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia has failed in its initial objective of capturing Kyiv and failed to subjugate Ukraine, but we cannot become complacent.  The United States and the international community will make Putin’s war of choice a long-term strategic failure for the Kremlin.</p>
