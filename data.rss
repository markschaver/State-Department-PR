					<description><![CDATA[<p>Geneva, Switzerland</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  Great.  Hey, good evening, everyone.  So just a few things at the top, but then we’ll do some questions.</p>
<p>I think that you heard from the President at the press conference that in his view, there is no substitute for face-to-face diplomacy, and I think that bore itself out in the conversations today with President Putin and his colleagues from Russia.  It’s one thing to be trading messages through you all or even on a phone call; it’s another to actually be able to sit down directly and go through the many issues, both the profound differences but also some areas of potential cooperation in the relationship.</p>
<p>And I would say that in the one-on-one or the one-plus-one, I guess, as it was, it was – and I thought the way both – certainly the way President Biden described it and what I heard President Putin say was a very accurate description of the tone of the session, which was very direct, I thought constructive, nonpolemical, and very matter-of-fact.  And I think that is useful in trying to see if – one, in just clarifying the differences, being very clear about how we see those differences, but also exploring whether there are areas where we can actually cooperate because it’s in our mutual interest to do so.</p>
<p>And really, it matches the objectives the President had set for this meeting with President Putin. One, to try to identify areas of practical cooperation that would actually advance our interests, and presumably our mutual interests; to be very clear in communicating directly that we’ll respond when those interests are being threatened or challenged.  And also, in a broader sense, to make – to share directly with President Putin the values that undergird our foreign policy, the President’s approach, by way of at least sharing directly with President Putin why we say the things we say, why we focus on the things that we do.  Doesn’t mean that’s going to convince him at all.  It does mean that by sharing that, communicating it clearly, maybe it lessens a little bit the possibility of miscommunication, misunderstanding.  And I think the President believes very strongly in being – just being very clear and direct, and that was the nature of the meeting.</p>
<p>I’d say that, as you heard the President say, there is some productive movement in a few areas, particularly the launch of a process on strategic stability to see if we can look at additional arms control measures in areas that are not covered by existing agreements – well, existing agreement, singular, since we basically have New START and its extension.  So that is both practical and productive.</p>
<p>Similarly, we agreed on the importance of having our ambassadors return to their respective capitals, and Ambassador Sullivan, who’s here, hopefully has his bag packed and will be getting ready to go back to Moscow, and Ambassador Antonov will come back to Washington.  And more broadly, to look to see if we can work through the challenges that we have in sustaining our diplomatic missions.  So there’s an agreement to work on that.</p>
<p>And then importantly, an agreement to get our experts together to consult on issues of cyber security, particularly when it comes to critical infrastructure and making sure that, as the President said, we should be – we have certain things, and he gave President Putin a list of 16 types of infrastructure that we believe should be out of bounds, off limits to destructive actions, whether it’s coming from a state or coming from an individual group that happens to be harbored in a state.  And we’re going to get our experts together to see if we can pursue something in that area.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are looking to see whether Russia will take action against the – those responsible for the attack on the Colonial Pipeline recently, and the President was clear that he does not ascribe that attack to Russia, but to criminals, criminal organizations that may be resident there.  So I think that was all practical and productive.  As the President made clear in the press conference, this is not flipping a light switch.  It&#8217;s going to take some time to see if these areas of potential cooperation actually produce results.  We don&#8217;t know, but we can now test that proposition.</p>
<p>Similarly, there were a number of regional issues that that they discussed where our interests overlap at least, and where it was agreed we should see if we could find ways to work together, particularly Afghanistan, also Syria – and there&#8217;ll be a test coming up on that with regard to the extension or not of the humanitarian corridor at the United Nations in about a month&#8217;s time.  We spent a good deal of time on both Syria and Afghanistan and also Iran and the effort to return to compliance with the JCPOA.  They discussed, again, other areas of potential cooperation: climate – touched on COVID-19, not in any extensive detail, but touched on that – and as well, the Arctic, where Russia is in the chair of the Arctic Council, and where we make clear our determination to preserve the Arctic as a region for peaceful cooperation.  And there was a discussion of that.</p>
<p>They also talked about areas where we have real clear and significant differences, starting with Ukraine, where the President reiterated our commitment to Ukraine’s independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty, but also some discussion of whether there might be grounds to actually try to unstick the Minsk process.   We’ll see if there’s any – if there’s any there there.  And Belarus, another area where we&#8217;re clearly in a very different place, and, of course, human rights.  And, in fact, the President – what the President said in his press conference on that is – reflects very much what he said directly to President Putin.  I think you heard him talk about how this is part of our DNA, and he couldn&#8217;t as an American president not raise these issues and continue to raise them.</p>
<p>So again, like – so let me just stop where I started.  The real purpose is to have this direct engagement to be able to be very clear about what we stand for, why we stand for it, where our concerns are, and where we think there may be opportunities to work together and to bring a little bit more stability and predictability into the relationship.  But as I said, we&#8217;re not flipping a light switch.  This is going to be an ongoing process and the ultimate test is whether there are practical results.  And I think we&#8217;re not going to know that for some time.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>(Off-mike.)</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Is this on background?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>It’s on background, senior administration official.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Senior administration official?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Senior administration official.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Could you give us a little more information or detail on the 16 sectors that he talked about?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>What are those 16 and what was the threatened response?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>I think it&#8217;s actually on our website.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Yeah, it’s on <a href="http://state.gov/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://state.gov&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623975606945000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGhgkQDxk2-T9C446sR2EACemwqpw">state.gov</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>It&#8217;s not a state secret. There — there are things that are, for fairly obvious reasons when you take a look, are critical to the life of the nation and that we believe should be out of balance from disruptive cyber actions or otherwise.  And actually,  has pulled up the website.  So among other things, the chemical sector, communications sector, critical manufacturing, dams, defense-industrial base, emergency services, the energy sector, financial services sector, food and agriculture.  Anyway, there are 16 of them, and it has as a more detailed description if you go onto the website.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And he’s more specifically given his list to Putin?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>To President Putin, yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And what would the response be?  Can you detail that?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>So this is where there was an agreement that we should get our teams together to consult on whether there&#8217;s a way forward on this and whether we can start a process to see if we can come to agreement on areas that should be out of bounds, and go from there.  But this is early days.  I think, again, the positive, productive step was an agreement to get teams and experts together, but it – this is going to take a while to see if there&#8217;s any real traction.  But at the same time, the President made very clear that if our interests were imperiled, he was very resolute about acting.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Can I ask on the Arctic?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Okay.  Go ahead.  Jenny, go ahead and we’ll go to Will.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>, can you tell us why the meetings ended so much earlier than were anticipated?  And then, do you have any more details on the Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed case?  What was the discussion around that?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>So, well, a few things.  They actually didn’t end that much earlier than anticipated in that there were some – in the original schedule there were some breaks that were built in that we didn’t fully take advantage of.  But it’s as the President said:  The amount of ground that the President covered in the – with President Putin in the 1+1 was extensive.  They covered most of the things if not all – virtually all of the things that were on our agenda.  And it goes back to what I was saying at the outset about this was a very – this was a very focused, practical, nonpolemical discussion, and as a result of that it wasn’t people reading talking points at each other or just going on monologues about this or that.  It was very practically focused on these different, very important issues.  And as a result, they covered a lot of ground.  And some of the ground that we anticipated possibly covering with the full teams they actually covered in the 1+1.</p>
<p>As a result, when we got to the larger meetings, they agreed that we had covered a lot of ground; as a result, we could compress the – what had initially – what were initially going to be two sessions with the full teams got compressed into one.  And that allowed us to drill deeper on a few areas that the two presidents had discussed but where we thought it was – the President thought it would be useful to go even deeper.  And then there were a few – there were two or three things that hadn’t come up that we wanted to at least touch on.  So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Will.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>I just want to ask – oh, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Sorry.  Paul Whelan and Trevor &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>Oh, I’m sorry.  And what was the question about them?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Can you give us more details?  Was there discussion of any sort of swap?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>I don’t want to get into any detail other than to say that the President was very clear about the need to resolve these cases and to see them freed.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Putin seemed pretty upset about the Arctic issue that he brought up.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I remember he brought something like this up in Reykjavik.  Is that the – is that a freedom of navigation issue where they’re doing the Northern Sea Route and they’re using these ice walls to restrict what happens there, in addition to the broader (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>There are two things.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And what was their response to that, and what (inaudible) about it?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>Well, there are two things.  I mean, they profess to share our conviction that the Arctic should remain an area of peaceful cooperation.  That’s good.  And they’re in the chairmanship of the Arctic Council, and we – I was – I was actually, as you know, the – was there with Foreign Minister Lavrov, among others, and we said we look forward to cooperating and working with them during their chairmanship.</p>
<p>But we have two concerns.  One are steps we see Russia taking that suggest that it is interested in militarizing more the region, and we think that is exactly contrary to our stated desires to ensure that the Arctic remains an area of peaceful cooperation.  And then separate – related but separate is this Northern Sea Route, and because the ice is melting so fast and because the route is now passable for a much longer stretch in the year, that’s going to increase traffic and that has the potential to make accidents, misunderstandings, miscalculations more possible.  And so we think that there’s a real need to make sure that there’s a clear understanding on the rules of the road for traffic there, which is increasing.</p>
<p>The Russians – I don’t want to speak for them, but they clearly have a somewhat different perspective on the militarization question, and we just see that differently.  We have the same stated objective.  We see what’s going on differently.  We’ll have to see whether there are ways both within the Arctic Council and outside the Arctic Council to work through some of these differences.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  A couple final questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Do you have this issue with – is the issue that they&#8217;re claiming sovereignty and regulating their full exclusive economic zone (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  There are issues there too.  They&#8217;ve asserted claims that we believe are not consistent with Law of the Sea.  And in fact, in a recent instance at least, a claim that there were asserting they pulled because it was clear that it was inconsistent with Law of the Sea.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  A couple of final questions.  Humeyra.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Sir, did you get any – did the President get any commitment from Putin about continue or even expanding the UN cross-border aid operation to Syria?  You said that that was going to be a test.  I have one more.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yeah.  No, there was no commitment, but we made clear that this was of significant importance for us.  And if there was going to be any further cooperation on Syria, in the first instance we had to see an extension of the humanitarian crossing.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And I’m just wondering why you think on this occasion Russia would behave differently, specifically in the cyber area.  There’s been sanctions.  There’s been all sorts of penalties before, but they haven’t changed behavior.  Why do you think that this might be different?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  I’ll let the President’s words speak for themselves, but I think that we’ve made clear that we will respond.  We’ve already demonstrated that in the case of SolarWinds as well as the election interference and the attempt to murder Mr. Navalny with a chemical weapon.  I think the President was also clear about his determination to respond if – going forward if Russia continues these kinds of actions.  And then also, I think the President was very eloquent this evening about some of the larger risks that Russia faces if it is not seen as a responsible actor in the international community.  And we’re seeing countries come together in very significant ways to stand up against other countries that are taking actions that challenge the rules-based order, that challenge basic norms of behavior and conduct.</p>
<p>And I think coming off of the G7, NATO, and the EU, where there was strong alignment on that – on the basic proposition that we all need to defend these understandings, this order, because the alternative is law of the jungle and chaos, which is in no one’s interest.  I think the President was able to speak with not only his own very strong clarity and conviction, but with knowledge on the part of Russia that we have allies and partners fully with us in making sure that we are working together to defend the rules-based order and to take action when anyone tries to undermine it.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Rich.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks.  , was there any discussion of Havana syndrome, audio attacks?  And on COVID, you said it was a small part of the conversation.  Was that largely based on vaccine distribution or was the origins investigation – any role in that as well?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  On COVID, there was a reference on the need for the international community to get to the bottom of what happened if we were going to be effective in trying to prevent a recurrence – not a detailed discussion but the basic point made that it was – this was of real importance.  And with regard to the anonymous health incidents, there was a – I would say a reference to it, but not a discussion.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Has he changed at all, Putin, since last time you met him, do you think?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>I’m not sure I’m qualified to comment.  I’ve been in meetings with him maybe a handful of times, so &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Very quick final question from Joel.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Can I just take a look back at NATO a little bit?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>The – NATO and the EU, Brussels generally.  The NATO communique language on China – and there’s a couple paragraphs there, but the communique acknowledged Stoltenberg’s expert (inaudible) report, but it didn&#8217;t really (inaudible) recommendations.  There’s not really any specific tasking – or that’s – there’s not really any specific tasking in the communique for the alliance on what’s to go forward.  And some of that seems driven by Western Europe.  Macron said that NATO shouldn’t get confused, China’s not in the North Atlantic – not very much – and the EU is expected to unveil this strategic compass next year during France’s presidency of the – the rotating presidency.</p>
<p>So is there – do you see a strategic divergence there with Western Europe?  And is there a plan to bridge that apparent gap with France or coordinate between NATO and the EU as those different – those strategies are coming together on different timelines?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  No, I’ve got to say quite the opposite.  I see a strategic convergence.  I wouldn’t say it’s total, but it’s actually moving in that direction, not in the opposite direction.  I mean, the G7, the last time the leaders met in 2018, had that in-person meeting, China wasn’t even mentioned in what they did.  And with regard to NATO, we have an agreement, among other things, on the need to revise the strategic concept.  Last time it was put together, in 2010, China was not mentioned; Russia was a partner, I think even a strategic partner.  So there’s clear, I think, understanding in each of these institutions, and with regard to the EU, we just had – we just resumed the U.S.-EU dialogue on China just a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>So I think the paragraphs that are in the NATO communique, as well as what was written in the G7 communique, actually reflect a growing convergence on concerns about China.  And whether it is supply chains, whether it’s human rights, whether it’s different activities that seem to pose a challenge to the interests and values of the countries that are part of the G7 or NATO or the EU, I think there’s a growing recognition of that.</p>
<p>And again, I think there’s also – if you look at what was said in these meetings and what’s reflected in the communiques, a recognition, too, that the relationship with China is a complicated one.  It’s not – there’s not a simple bumper sticker that sums it up either, and I think there’s a general convergence around the proposition that for most of our countries, China has – the relationship with China is in parts adversarial, in parts competitive, and also in parts cooperative.  But we’re – in dealing with any of those aspects of the relationship, we’re all going to be much more effective and much stronger if we’re working in common purpose.  And that’s what, I think, you’re seeing.</p>
<p>With regard to the NATO specifics, take a look at paragraph 24 of the communique and the list of things that the Allies agreed we are going to pursue to make sure that NATO is actually adapted to the challenges of today and tomorrow.  There is a very detailed work plan, and the point was not to have resolved all of these issues, it was to set NATO on a course over the next year – between now and the next summit – to work on the details and to make sure that the alliance is resourced appropriately so that it can take on these new responsibilities and new missions.  So I’ve got to say we felt very good about the substance, where we landed, and the forward motion that was launched at this summit and that will carry us to the next one.</p>
<p>But again, as most things, nothing is flipping a light switch.  It’s do you have a clear roadmap, a clear plan, and clear, shared commitments.  I think the answer is yes.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Just a quick final data point:  The Under Secretary for Political Affairs along with Eric Green from the NSC tomorrow will travel to Brussels.  They’ll brief our NATO Allies.  They’ll brief the EU, along with the Japanese and the Ukrainians.  Important for us to consult both before and after these types of engagements and that’ll help with that.</p>

<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>So this is where there was an agreement that we should get our teams together to consult on whether there&#8217;s a way forward on this and whether we can start a process to see if we can come to agreement on areas that should be out of bounds, and go from there.  But this is early days.  I think, again, the positive, productive step was an agreement to get teams and experts together, but it – this is going to take a while to see if there&#8217;s any real traction.  But at the same time, the President made very clear that if our interests were imperiled, he was very resolute about acting.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Can I ask on the Arctic?</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Okay.  Go ahead.  Jenny, go ahead and we’ll go to Will.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>, can you tell us why the meetings ended so much earlier than were anticipated?  And then, do you have any more details on the Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed case?  What was the discussion around that?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>So, well, a few things.  They actually didn’t end that much earlier than anticipated in that there were some – in the original schedule there were some breaks that were built in that we didn’t fully take advantage of.  But it’s as the President said:  The amount of ground that the President covered in the – with President Putin in the 1+1 was extensive.  They covered most of the things if not all – virtually all of the things that were on our agenda.  And it goes back to what I was saying at the outset about this was a very – this was a very focused, practical, nonpolemical discussion, and as a result of that it wasn’t people reading talking points at each other or just going on monologues about this or that.  It was very practically focused on these different, very important issues.  And as a result, they covered a lot of ground.  And some of the ground that we anticipated possibly covering with the full teams they actually covered in the 1+1.</p>
<p>As a result, when we got to the larger meetings, they agreed that we had covered a lot of ground; as a result, we could compress the – what had initially – what were initially going to be two sessions with the full teams got compressed into one.  And that allowed us to drill deeper on a few areas that the two presidents had discussed but where we thought it was – the President thought it would be useful to go even deeper.  And then there were a few – there were two or three things that hadn’t come up that we wanted to at least touch on.  So &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:  </strong>Will.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>I just want to ask – oh, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Sorry.  Paul Whelan and Trevor &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>Oh, I’m sorry.  And what was the question about them?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Can you give us more details?  Was there discussion of any sort of swap?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>I don’t want to get into any detail other than to say that the President was very clear about the need to resolve these cases and to see them freed.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Putin seemed pretty upset about the Arctic issue that he brought up.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  I remember he brought something like this up in Reykjavik.  Is that the – is that a freedom of navigation issue where they’re doing the Northern Sea Route and they’re using these ice walls to restrict what happens there, in addition to the broader (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>There are two things.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>And what was their response to that, and what (inaudible) about it?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>Well, there are two things.  I mean, they profess to share our conviction that the Arctic should remain an area of peaceful cooperation.  That’s good.  And they’re in the chairmanship of the Arctic Council, and we – I was – I was actually, as you know, the – was there with Foreign Minister Lavrov, among others, and we said we look forward to cooperating and working with them during their chairmanship.</p>
<p>But we have two concerns.  One are steps we see Russia taking that suggest that it is interested in militarizing more the region, and we think that is exactly contrary to our stated desires to ensure that the Arctic remains an area of peaceful cooperation.  And then separate – related but separate is this Northern Sea Route, and because the ice is melting so fast and because the route is now passable for a much longer stretch in the year, that’s going to increase traffic and that has the potential to make accidents, misunderstandings, miscalculations more possible.  And so we think that there’s a real need to make sure that there’s a clear understanding on the rules of the road for traffic there, which is increasing.</p>
<p>The Russians – I don’t want to speak for them, but they clearly have a somewhat different perspective on the militarization question, and we just see that differently.  We have the same stated objective.  We see what’s going on differently.  We’ll have to see whether there are ways both within the Arctic Council and outside the Arctic Council to work through some of these differences.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  A couple final questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Do you have this issue with – is the issue that they&#8217;re claiming sovereignty and regulating their full exclusive economic zone (inaudible)?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  There are issues there too.  They&#8217;ve asserted claims that we believe are not consistent with Law of the Sea.  And in fact, in a recent instance at least, a claim that there were asserting they pulled because it was clear that it was inconsistent with Law of the Sea.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  A couple of final questions.  Humeyra.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Sir, did you get any – did the President get any commitment from Putin about continue or even expanding the UN cross-border aid operation to Syria?  You said that that was going to be a test.  I have one more.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  Yeah.  No, there was no commitment, but we made clear that this was of significant importance for us.  And if there was going to be any further cooperation on Syria, in the first instance we had to see an extension of the humanitarian crossing.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  And I’m just wondering why you think on this occasion Russia would behave differently, specifically in the cyber area.  There’s been sanctions.  There’s been all sorts of penalties before, but they haven’t changed behavior.  Why do you think that this might be different?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  I’ll let the President’s words speak for themselves, but I think that we’ve made clear that we will respond.  We’ve already demonstrated that in the case of SolarWinds as well as the election interference and the attempt to murder Mr. Navalny with a chemical weapon.  I think the President was also clear about his determination to respond if – going forward if Russia continues these kinds of actions.  And then also, I think the President was very eloquent this evening about some of the larger risks that Russia faces if it is not seen as a responsible actor in the international community.  And we’re seeing countries come together in very significant ways to stand up against other countries that are taking actions that challenge the rules-based order, that challenge basic norms of behavior and conduct.</p>
<p>And I think coming off of the G7, NATO, and the EU, where there was strong alignment on that – on the basic proposition that we all need to defend these understandings, this order, because the alternative is law of the jungle and chaos, which is in no one’s interest.  I think the President was able to speak with not only his own very strong clarity and conviction, but with knowledge on the part of Russia that we have allies and partners fully with us in making sure that we are working together to defend the rules-based order and to take action when anyone tries to undermine it.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Rich.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thanks.  , was there any discussion of Havana syndrome, audio attacks?  And on COVID, you said it was a small part of the conversation.  Was that largely based on vaccine distribution or was the origins investigation – any role in that as well?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  On COVID, there was a reference on the need for the international community to get to the bottom of what happened if we were going to be effective in trying to prevent a recurrence – not a detailed discussion but the basic point made that it was – this was of real importance.  And with regard to the anonymous health incidents, there was a – I would say a reference to it, but not a discussion.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Has he changed at all, Putin, since last time you met him, do you think?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>I’m not sure I’m qualified to comment.  I’ve been in meetings with him maybe a handful of times, so &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Very quick final question from Joel.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Can I just take a look back at NATO a little bit?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  </strong>Sure.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>The – NATO and the EU, Brussels generally.  The NATO communique language on China – and there’s a couple paragraphs there, but the communique acknowledged Stoltenberg’s expert (inaudible) report, but it didn&#8217;t really (inaudible) recommendations.  There’s not really any specific tasking – or that’s – there’s not really any specific tasking in the communique for the alliance on what’s to go forward.  And some of that seems driven by Western Europe.  Macron said that NATO shouldn’t get confused, China’s not in the North Atlantic – not very much – and the EU is expected to unveil this strategic compass next year during France’s presidency of the – the rotating presidency.</p>
<p>So is there – do you see a strategic divergence there with Western Europe?  And is there a plan to bridge that apparent gap with France or coordinate between NATO and the EU as those different – those strategies are coming together on different timelines?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:</strong>  No, I’ve got to say quite the opposite.  I see a strategic convergence.  I wouldn’t say it’s total, but it’s actually moving in that direction, not in the opposite direction.  I mean, the G7, the last time the leaders met in 2018, had that in-person meeting, China wasn’t even mentioned in what they did.  And with regard to NATO, we have an agreement, among other things, on the need to revise the strategic concept.  Last time it was put together, in 2010, China was not mentioned; Russia was a partner, I think even a strategic partner.  So there’s clear, I think, understanding in each of these institutions, and with regard to the EU, we just had – we just resumed the U.S.-EU dialogue on China just a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>So I think the paragraphs that are in the NATO communique, as well as what was written in the G7 communique, actually reflect a growing convergence on concerns about China.  And whether it is supply chains, whether it’s human rights, whether it’s different activities that seem to pose a challenge to the interests and values of the countries that are part of the G7 or NATO or the EU, I think there’s a growing recognition of that.</p>
<p>And again, I think there’s also – if you look at what was said in these meetings and what’s reflected in the communiques, a recognition, too, that the relationship with China is a complicated one.  It’s not – there’s not a simple bumper sticker that sums it up either, and I think there’s a general convergence around the proposition that for most of our countries, China has – the relationship with China is in parts adversarial, in parts competitive, and also in parts cooperative.  But we’re – in dealing with any of those aspects of the relationship, we’re all going to be much more effective and much stronger if we’re working in common purpose.  And that’s what, I think, you’re seeing.</p>
<p>With regard to the NATO specifics, take a look at paragraph 24 of the communique and the list of things that the Allies agreed we are going to pursue to make sure that NATO is actually adapted to the challenges of today and tomorrow.  There is a very detailed work plan, and the point was not to have resolved all of these issues, it was to set NATO on a course over the next year – between now and the next summit – to work on the details and to make sure that the alliance is resourced appropriately so that it can take on these new responsibilities and new missions.  So I’ve got to say we felt very good about the substance, where we landed, and the forward motion that was launched at this summit and that will carry us to the next one.</p>
<p>But again, as most things, nothing is flipping a light switch.  It’s do you have a clear roadmap, a clear plan, and clear, shared commitments.  I think the answer is yes.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong>  Just a quick final data point:  The Under Secretary for Political Affairs along with Eric Green from the NSC tomorrow will travel to Brussels.  They’ll brief our NATO Allies.  They’ll brief the EU, along with the Japanese and the Ukrainians.  Important for us to consult both before and after these types of engagements and that’ll help with that.</p>

<p>Yesterday, an overwhelming majority of Organization of American States (OAS) member states sent a clear message of support for the Nicaraguan people and their fight for free and fair elections, respect for human rights, and accountability. The resolution approved yesterday condemns the Ortega-Murillo regime’s repression in Nicaragua and calls for the immediate release of the four presidential candidates recently detained, along with over 130 other political prisoners. It also concludes that, in the wake of the regime’s recent repression and its lack of meaningful electoral reform, the conditions for free and fair elections this November do not exist. The United States strongly supports the OAS Permanent Council’s call for President Ortega to take urgent action to restore full respect for human rights and to create the conditions for free and fair elections.</p>
<p>It is time for the Ortega-Murillo regime to change course, respect both its own constitution as well as its commitments under the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and allow the Nicaraguan people to fully exercise their rights—including their right to choose their leaders in free and fair elections. We look forward to continuing to work with OAS member states, as well as other democratic governments around the world, including with our partners in the European Union, to press for greater freedom for the Nicaraguan people. Through yesterday’s vote, the members of the OAS made clear that Ortega and Murillo’s actions have no place in this hemisphere, given our shared commitments to democracy and human rights.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Today marks the tenth anniversary of the unanimous endorsement by the UN Human Rights Council of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). These principles recognize a three-pronged approach to protecting human rights in the context of business activity: States have the duty to protect human rights; businesses have a responsibility to respect human rights; and victims affected by business-related human rights issues should have access to remedy. We commemorate the achievements made over the last decade in these areas, and take heed of the substantive work that still needs to be done toward realization of these principles.</p>
<p>Businesses can provide crucial support for democratic principles, including respect for human and labor rights. They have the capacity to help shape society and the environment – raising local wages, improving working conditions, building trust with communities, and operating sustainably. As a result, businesses have a key role in addressing human rights abuses, including throughout their value chains.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the next decade, we must go further in shaping the business and human rights agenda. This will take concerted efforts by governments, businesses, and other stakeholders. Doing so is not only the right thing to do but the smart thing to do. We know that companies thrive and economies prosper when there is strong rule of law and adherence to human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as respect for international labor, environmental, and technical standards, good governance, and accountable institutions. Businesses in the rapidly evolving emerging technology sector have a particular opportunity to shape its deployment and establish guardrails against misuse. There also needs to be more attention on the leverage wielded by investors, including private equity, venture capital firms, and multilateral development banks to address human rights abuses, including those committed against environmental defenders. That is why today I am pleased to announce that the State Department, working with the White House and other federal departments and agencies, will soon begin the process of updating and revitalizing the United States’ National Action Plan (NAP) on Responsible Business Conduct.</p>
<p>The Department is renewing its commitment to advance business and human rights under the framework set out in the UNGPs, and in comparable provisions in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, which were updated 10 years ago as well. As we look forward to the next decade under the UNGPs, we recognize there is still much work to be done. The success of future efforts to build upon the UNGPs will depend upon maintaining the approaches that have made them such a success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Today marks the tenth anniversary of the unanimous endorsement by the UN Human Rights Council of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). These principles recognize a three-pronged approach to protecting human rights in the context of business activity: States have the duty to protect human rights; businesses have a responsibility to respect human rights; and victims affected by business-related human rights issues should have access to remedy. We commemorate the achievements made over the last decade in these areas, and take heed of the substantive work that still needs to be done toward realization of these principles.</p>
<p>Businesses can provide crucial support for democratic principles, including respect for human and labor rights. They have the capacity to help shape society and the environment – raising local wages, improving working conditions, building trust with communities, and operating sustainably. As a result, businesses have a key role in addressing human rights abuses, including throughout their value chains.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the next decade, we must go further in shaping the business and human rights agenda. This will take concerted efforts by governments, businesses, and other stakeholders. Doing so is not only the right thing to do but the smart thing to do. We know that companies thrive and economies prosper when there is strong rule of law and adherence to human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as respect for international labor, environmental, and technical standards, good governance, and accountable institutions. Businesses in the rapidly evolving emerging technology sector have a particular opportunity to shape its deployment and establish guardrails against misuse. There also needs to be more attention on the leverage wielded by investors, including private equity, venture capital firms, and multilateral development banks to address human rights abuses, including those committed against environmental defenders. That is why today I am pleased to announce that the State Department, working with the White House and other federal departments and agencies, will soon begin the process of updating and revitalizing the United States’ National Action Plan (NAP) on Responsible Business Conduct.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Jalina Porter, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p>2:11 p.m. EDT</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you so much for joining today’s State Department press briefing. I have two updates at the top before I start taking your questions.</p>
<p><a id="post-252304-CentralAmerica"></a> I would like to draw your attention to the joint statement issued by Secretary Blinken and Secretary Mayorkas today about the expansion of the Central American Minors, or CAM, program, which provides certain Guatemalan, Honduran, or Salvadoran children access to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.</p>
<p>As a part of our focus on a responsible, phased approach to humanely managing migration and expanding legal pathways, we continue to reopen cases in our efforts to reunite families. Since we announced CAM’s reopening in March, we have reopened approximately 1,100 cases.</p>
<p>As we continue to develop and expand initiatives that provide a safe, legal, and orderly alternative to dangerous irregular migration, we are announcing today the second phase of the CAM reopening that will expand the ability of tens of thousands of U.S.-based individuals to petition for children to access the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program through CAM.</p>
<p>Petitioner eligibility will now be extended to legal guardians, in addition to parents, who are lawfully present in the United States.</p>
<p>This expansion will also allow certain parents and legal guardians who have a pending asylum application or a pending U visa petition, filed prior to May 15th, 2021, the ability to reunite with their children.</p>
<p>This is just one component of the President’s multi-pronged approach to address the challenges of irregular migration through and from Central America.</p>
<p>The steps we are taking reflect our values as a nation and represent our continued commitment to ensure that we treat people with dignity and respect, and that we protect the most vulnerable people, especially our children.</p>
<p><a id="post-252304-DRC"></a> And as you might have seen, Acting Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Lisa Peterson is in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC, from June 14th through June 16th – I’m sorry, June 18th – representing the United States in the first ever U.S.-DRC bilateral human rights dialogue.</p>
<p>The dialogue is an opportunity to have an open discussion about the most pressing democratic and human rights issues facing the country and how the United States can support the DRC in its efforts to advance respect for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p>This dialogue is focused on promoting accountability for human rights abuses, ongoing Congolese preparations for an on-time, free, and fair election in 2023, continued progress in combating trafficking in persons under President Tshisekedi, and protecting and preserving fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p>With that, we’ll give it a few minutes before we start taking your questions.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Shaun Tandon.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you. Shaun Tandon’s line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Jalina. Hope you’re well. I was wondering if you had anything to say about the march that’s going ahead today in Jerusalem. Does the State Department have any concerns about it? What’s your assessment of how it’s going, and what’s your message to the two sides on how to handle this?</p>
<p>If you can allow me, just briefly something else as well. The Hungarian parliament passed a law that – it aimed at prohibiting quote-unquote “promotion of homosexuality.” How does the State Department see that? Will this at all affect relations with Prime Minister Orban? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thank you, Shaun. <a id="post-252304-MiddleEastPeace"></a>To your first question, well, we certainly don’t have an assessment to state from here, but what we can say is we believe that it’s essential for all parties to refrain from any steps that exacerbate tensions.</p>
<p>And to your second question, I’ll just lead with, of course, <a id="post-252304-Hungary"></a>as you know, the United States is centering our foreign policy around human rights. And of course, that includes the struggle to end discrimination, criminalization, as well as stigma against LGBTQI persons all around the world. And of course, that is essential to the commitment that we have to fundamental freedoms for people who are individuals not only in the United States, but to our partners and allies globally as well.</p>
<p>So we’re certainly aware of the law that passed today, and of course it raises concerns about, again, what I said about freedoms of expression, as well as the restrictions on – which have no place in democratic societies. The United States is actually committed to strengthening our partnership with Hungary, as well as advancing the Biden administration’s support for democratic institutions, human rights, as well as rule of law globally.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Jiha Ham.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Ms. Ham’s line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Okay. Hi, Jalina. Thank you for taking my question. So North Korea yesterday released a statement criticizing Japan because Japan is holding a symposium in the UN over the abduction issue later this month. North Korea claimed that the abduction issue was already resolved. But as you know, not only Japanese but also many South Koreans were taken to North Korea in the past. How do you view this issue? Could you tell us if the new policy on North Korea can handle this abduction issue, along with other critical issues? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Jiha. <a id="post-252304-NorthKoreaJapan"></a>So to your specific question on North Korea and Japan, I’d have to refer you to those governments. But from our end, our policy on the DPRK has not changed.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Simon Lewis, please.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Simon Lewis’s line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. Thanks, Jalina. I wanted to see if you have any response to some calls coming out of meeting of Arab states in Qatar today, who are asking for the UN Security Council to discuss and step in over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, or the GERD. Does the U.S. – would the U.S. sort of welcome that, and would you like to see that brought up in the Security Council, and is there any specific action that you would advocate for in that forum? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> <a id="post-252304-EthiopiaGERD"></a>So on that issue, we don’t have any updates or any announcements today. But what I will say, broadly speaking, is that the United States continues to support collaborative as well as constructive efforts by Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan in order to reach an arrangement on the GERD. And of course, we understand the importance of the Nile water to all three of those countries, and we’ll continue to encourage resumption of productive dialogue on the GERD. But outside of that, I have nothing to preview at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Tracy Wilkinson.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Hi.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> He didn’t say my line was open; I was waiting. Okay. On the Central American Minors Program, can you – so this is going to vastly or largely expand the number of potential petitioners for people who want to bring their kids up. Do you have any estimate, ballpark figures of how many people – how many additional cases and kids we’re talking about could come up, could be – their arrival could be applied for? And I understand all of the processing is going to take place in the home country, so my question – the second question is whether you’ve had – what kind of discussions you’ve had with the governments of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala for their cooperation in this. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> <a id="post-252304-CentralAmerica2"></a>So I’ll just say at the top – so in the restart of the CAM Program we’ve identified a little over 3,100 cases – that’d be 3,162 cases to be exact – representing 3,828 individuals. Right now we just can’t speculate on how many may ultimately be resettled as refugees or be admitted via parole status.</p>
<p>Now to your second question on any dialogue, I have nothing to preview at this time.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Laura Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Laura Kelly, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you so much. Hi, Jalina. Thanks for taking my question. The Iranian presidential elections are set to take place this Friday and polling indicates a low turnout of voters. How is the administration viewing the legitimacy of these elections? And if I may, what is the impact that the Iranian presidential elections have on U.S. discussions in Vienna to rejoin the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> <a id="post-252304-Iran"></a>Well, we’re – I’m certainly not in the position to determine or state from here – to determine the legitimacy of Iran’s elections, and we certainly won’t get ahead of that this Friday. That’s something for the Iranian people to decide for themselves.</p>
<p>And just to your point on the talks in Vienna, as you know our Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley is in his sixth round of talks in Vienna this week, and again, I’ll continue to underscore that meaningful process continues to be made on the language necessary to address nuclear and sanctions-related issues. But of course, there are – outstanding issues remain on both of them, as well. These meetings, of course, have been productive but they’re ongoing, so outside of that I don&#8217;t have anything to announce as well.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Jessica Donati.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Jessica Donati, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up with Tracy’s question. In the opening, you said that this could affect potentially tens of thousands of cases for children, but then later you said that there was just going – you only identified three to four thousand. I was wondering if you could clarify.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> <a id="post-252304-CentralAmerica3"></a>Yeah, my clarification was, again, in the restart of the CAM Program where identified – where we identified over 3,000 cases, which was 3,162 cases representing 3,828 individuals. Beyond that, if you have any other specific questions we’d be happy to take that for you, but that’s all we have to preview for today.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Michele Kelemen.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Michele Kelemen, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. The new Israeli foreign minister is indicating that he wants to improve relations with Democrats in Washington, restore kind of the bipartisan nature of the U.S.-Israel relationship. And I’m wondering, would the State Department help facilitate that, and when might we see a visit by Yair Lapid? I saw that Blinken has – the Secretary has invited Lapid to Washington.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> <a id="post-252304-Israel"></a>For now, we don’t have any visits to announce at this time. And when it comes to their relations with Congress, we’ll leave that to members of the House and senators to determine their engagement, but that’s something that we wouldn’t facilitate or do anything like that from here.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Soyoung Kim.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Soyoung Kim, your line is open.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. South Korea’s minister of reunification was supposed to visit the U.S. for the U.S.-South Korea working group meeting to mainly discuss North Korea issues sometime this month, but it was called off with no official details. Do you know the reason why the plan was canceled, and when do you think the next meeting is possible and reschedule?</p>
<p>And just a briefly follow-up question: Is the U.S. still trying to reach out to the North Korea or waiting until there is response from the North? Any update? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> <a id="post-252304-NorthKoreaSouthKorea"></a>So your – the first question you asked, we’re going to have to take back to you. And to your second question on engagement, we don’t have anything to update you on today or any announcements to make.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Soyoung’s line is open again.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Oh, the first question? Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks. I believe we’ve asked – we’ve answered Soyoung’s questions. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> We can go to Doug Byun.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> There is no one by that name in the question queue.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Okay. We’re going to take our last question from Said.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Jalina. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Jalina, just to follow up on Shaun’s question, it is really getting out of hand with this march. The Israelis are arresting all kinds of Palestinians, including my colleagues, journalists who are covering the event. And it’s a very volatile situation. The Israelis did not heed your call to hold back on this march. So are you not concerned that this may get out of hand and we may end up in a situation that we had in last May? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> <a id="post-252304-MiddleEastPeace2"></a>Thank you for your question, Said. From here, again, I’ll continue to underscore that we believe it’s essential for all parties to refrain from any steps that would exacerbate tensions.</p>
<p>And with that, thank you all for joining today’s press briefing, and I hope you have a wonderful week ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:31 p.m.)</p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken delivered virtual remarks today to congratulate Brazil on signing the Artemis Accords.  Brazil is the first South American country to join the Accords.  Led by the Department of State and NASA, the Artemis Accords build a path toward peaceful and responsible space exploration beyond Earth’s orbit and are a keystone of our space diplomacy.  The Secretary thanked President Bolsonaro, Minister Pontes, Minister França, and all those gathered in Brasília, emphasizing that the United States looks forward to expanding space cooperation with international and commercial partners while aiming to land the first woman and the first person of color on the surface of the Moon.  NASA’s Artemis program will allow us to develop the technologies and experience necessary to mount a historic human mission to Mars.</p>

		<title>Joint Statement by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Homeland Security on the Expansion of Access to the Central American Minors Program</title>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The following joint statement was released by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas.</p>
<p><em>Begin Text:</em></p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration have been making progress toward reinstituting and improving the Central American Minors (CAM) program since our agencies launched the first phase of its reopening on March 10.  As part of this focus on a responsible, phased approach, we continue to reopen cases that were closed when CAM was terminated in 2018.  This is just one component of the President’s multi-pronged approach to address the challenges of irregular migration throughout North and Central America.</p>
<p>Today, we are proud to announce the second phase of the CAM reopening, which will expand access to the program to a greater number of qualifying individuals.  Eligibility to petition will now be extended to include legal guardians (in addition to parents) who are in the United States pursuant to any of the following qualifying categories: lawful permanent residence; temporary protected status; parole; deferred action; deferred enforced departure; or withholding of removal.  In addition, this expansion of eligibility will now include certain U.S.-based parents or legal guardians who have a pending asylum application or a pending U visa petition filed before May 15, 2021.  It will allow them to petition for access to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program on behalf of their children who are nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras for potential resettlement in the United States.  These new changes will dramatically expand access to the CAM program.</p>
<p>We are firmly committed to welcoming people to the United States with humanity and respect, as well as providing a legal alternative to irregular migration.  We are delivering on our promise to promote safe, orderly, and humane migration from Central America through this expansion of legal pathways to seek humanitarian protection in the United States.</p>
