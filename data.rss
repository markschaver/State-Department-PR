					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Department of State is taking additional actions to hold accountable those engaged in human rights abuses, to impose severe costs on the Government of the Russian Federation (GoR), and to degrade the Kremlin’s ability to support Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine and fund its war of aggression.</p>
<p><strong>Visa Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Today, the Department of State is announcing a series of actions to promote individual accountability for human rights abuses, to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new visa restriction policy under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that applies to Russian Federation military officials and Russia-backed or Russia-installed purported authorities who are believed to have been involved in human rights abuses, violations of international humanitarian law, or public corruption in Ukraine, including in the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” or “Luhansk People’s Republic.” Family members of those who fall under the policy will also be ineligible for visas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Action to impose visa restrictions on 2,596 members of the Russian Federation military and 13 Belarusian military officials pursuant to a policy under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that applies to those who are believed to have supported, been actively complicit in, or been responsible for ordering or otherwise directing or authorizing actions that threaten or violate the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Designation of three Belarusian officials, Dzmitry Paulichenka, Yury Sivakov, and Viktar Sheiman, pursuant to Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2022 for their involvement in a gross violation of human rights. Under this authority, immediate family members are also ineligible for entry to the United States, to include Viktar Sheiman’s wife, Elena Sheiman, and his adult son, Sergei Sheiman.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Targeting Russia’s Maritime Sector</strong></p>
<p>The GoR leverages maritime shipping and other marine sector companies to advance its strategic aims, including by supporting the resupply of its troops and the continuation of its occupationof Crimea, and exploiting and exporting energy reserves.  Today, the Department of State is designating eight Russian maritime-related companies.  This includes the Russian Ministry of Defense’s shipping company, Oboronlogistika OOO, which has been involved in Russia’s illegal seizure and occupation of  Crimea since 2014, as well as private Russian maritime shipping companies that transport weapons and other military equipment for the GoR.  The Department of State also took action against vessels these maritime shipping companies have an interest in with the addition of 69 vessels  to the Department of the Treasury’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.  The Department of State is also designating one maritime engineering company that works with the GoR and Russian state-owned entities. This action serves as a warning to private Russian companies that those who support Putin’s war machine risk severe costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Department of State is taking additional actions to hold accountable those engaged in human rights abuses, to impose severe costs on the Government of the Russian Federation (GoR), and to degrade the Kremlin’s ability to support Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine and fund its war of aggression.</p>
<p><strong>Visa Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Today, the Department of State is announcing a series of actions to promote individual accountability for human rights abuses, to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new visa restriction policy under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that applies to Russian Federation military officials and Russia-backed or Russia-installed purported authorities who are believed to have been involved in human rights abuses, violations of international humanitarian law, or public corruption in Ukraine, including in the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” or “Luhansk People’s Republic.” Family members of those who fall under the policy will also be ineligible for visas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Action to impose visa restrictions on 2,596 members of the Russian Federation military and 13 Belarusian military officials pursuant to a policy under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that applies to those who are believed to have supported, been actively complicit in, or been responsible for ordering or otherwise directing or authorizing actions that threaten or violate the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Designation of three Belarusian officials, Dzmitry Paulichenka, Yury Sivakov, and Viktar Sheiman, pursuant to Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2022 for their involvement in a gross violation of human rights. Under this authority, immediate family members are also ineligible for entry to the United States, to include Viktar Sheiman’s wife, Elena Sheiman, and his adult son, Sergei Sheiman.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Targeting Russia’s Maritime Sector</strong></p>
<p>The GoR leverages maritime shipping and other marine sector companies to advance its strategic aims, including by supporting the resupply of its troops and the continuation of its occupationof Crimea, and exploiting and exporting energy reserves.  Today, the Department of State is designating eight Russian maritime-related companies.  This includes the Russian Ministry of Defense’s shipping company, Oboronlogistika OOO, which has been involved in Russia’s illegal seizure and occupation of  Crimea since 2014, as well as private Russian maritime shipping companies that transport weapons and other military equipment for the GoR.  The Department of State also took action against vessels these maritime shipping companies have an interest in with the addition of 69 vessels  to the Department of the Treasury’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.  The Department of State is also designating one maritime engineering company that works with the GoR and Russian state-owned entities. This action serves as a warning to private Russian companies that those who support Putin’s war machine risk severe costs.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony J.

<p>On May 5, the people of Northern Ireland voted in the seventh election for their devolved legislature since the 1998 Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.  The political and economic progress enjoyed over this period is a testament to the benefits of a locally accountable power-sharing government that reflects Northern Ireland’s diverse traditions.</p>
<p>We call on Northern Ireland’s political leaders to take the necessary steps to re-establish a power-sharing executive, which is one of the core institutions established by the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.  Critical and immediate challenges concerning the economy, health, and education are best addressed through the collective efforts of a devolved government chosen by, and accountable to, its people.</p>
<p>The United States enjoys a deep and long-standing relationship with Northern Ireland, grounded in ties of kinship, culture, commerce, and shared values.  We remain deeply committed to preserving the peace dividend of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and will always strive to protect these gains for all communities.  We look forward to continuing our work with democratic partners in Northern Ireland, and with the Governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland, to support peace, prosperity, and stability across the region.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>More than two months into the Kremlin’s unjustified and brutal war, it is impossible not to be moved by what the people of Ukraine have achieved.  It is also impossible not to believe that they will keep succeeding, because they have demonstrated that they have the will and skill to fight.  Despite the suffering they have endured, and the widespread death and destruction that Russia’s brutal and unprovoked war continues to inflict, Ukraine is and will continue to be a free and independent country.</p>
<p>I am authorizing today, pursuant to a delegation from the President, a drawdown to provide further immediate military assistance to Ukraine, valued at up to $150 million worth of additional arms and equipment from U.S. Department of Defense inventories.  This authorization is the ninth drawdown of arms, equipment, and supplies from Department of Defense inventories for Ukraine since August 2021.  This brings total U.S. security assistance to Ukraine to approximately $3.8 billion in arms and equipment since Russia launched its brutal and unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24.</p>
<p>We will continue to provide Ukraine the arms its forces are effectively using to defend their country and the freedom of their fellow citizens.  In addition to military assistance, we also continue to provide direct U.S. financial support to Ukraine, support for documenting evidence of Russia’s atrocities against Ukraine’s civilians, and measures to continue ratcheting up the pressure on Putin’s crumbling economy.  Taken together, these efforts will help strengthen Ukraine’s position at the negotiating table while continuing to isolate Russia from the world until it ends its senseless war of choice on Ukraine.</p>
<p>The United States, our Allies, and our partners are proud to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine in their just cause  ̶  the defense of their country and their democracy.  Together, we will continue to support Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and we will continue to fund humanitarian assistance for those in need.  Ukraine won the battle for Kyiv and we will help Ukraine keep up the fight for as long as it takes. We stand united with Ukraine.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p><span>The Department of State is offering a reward of up to $10,000,000 for information leading to the identification and/or location of any individual(s) who hold a key leadership position in the Conti ransomware variant transnational organized crime group.  In addition, the Department is also offering a reward of up to $5,000,000 for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of any individual in any country conspiring to participate in or attempting to participate in a Conti variant ransomware incident.</span></p>
<p><span>The Conti ransomware group has been responsible for hundreds of ransomware incidents over the past two years.  The FBI estimates that as of January 2022, there had been over 1,000 victims of attacks associated with Conti ransomware with victim payouts exceeding $150,000,000, making the Conti Ransomware variant the costliest strain of ransomware ever documented.  In April 2022, the group perpetrated a ransomware incident against the Government of Costa Rica that severely impacted the country’s foreign trade by disrupting its customs and taxes platforms.  In offering this reward, the United States demonstrates its commitment to protecting potential ransomware victims around the world from exploitation by cyber criminals.  We look to partner with nations willing to bring justice for those victims affected by ransomware.</span></p>
<p><span>This reward is offered under the Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program (TOCRP).</span></p>
<p><span>The Department manages the TOCRP in close coordination with our federal law enforcement partners as part of a whole of government effort to disrupt and dismantle transnational organized crime globally, including cybercrime.  More than 75 transnational criminals and major narcotics traffickers have been brought to justice under the TOCRP and the Narcotics Rewards Program (NRP) since 1986.  The Department has paid more than $135 million in rewards under these programs to date.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Jalina Porter, Principal Deputy Spokesperson</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><a id="post-341695-Israel"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you so much for joining today’s briefing. I have two elements at the top and then I will take your questions.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate that we vehemently condemn the terrorist attack in Elad, Israel, which killed at least three and wounded many others. This was a horrific attack targeting innocent men and women and was particularly heinous coming as Israel celebrated its Independence Day. Our hearts are with the victims and loved ones of those killed, and we wish those injured a speedy recovery. We remain in close contact with our Israeli friends and partners and stand firmly with them in the face of this attack.</p>
<p><a id="post-341695-IsraelPalestinianAffairs"></a> Separately, we understand that Israel announced a meeting to advance new West Bank settlements for – West Bank settlement units for May 12. The Biden administration has been clear from the outset. We strongly oppose the expansion of settlements which exacerbates tensions and undermines trust between the parties. Israel’s program of expanding settlements deeply damages the prospect for a two-state solution.</p>
<p>Let’s go to the line of Ron Kampeas, please.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you for taking the call. What if anything will be the repercussions for Israel’s announcement of approvals for 4,000 more units? I know that you’re saying that you – you’re condemning this, but will there be any repercussions, particularly related to President Biden’s visit next month?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks for your question. I’ll just say from here that we have been clear about the need to avoid unilateral steps that would exacerbate tensions and make it more difficult to preserve the viability of a two-state solution. I have nothing to comment about the President’s upcoming trip.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Endale Getahun.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Yes. Good morning, Jalina. Can you hear me? This is Endale.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Good afternoon. I can hear you, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks so much. I have two questions.</p>
<p>One is – will be on the statement that was made by our Secretary Blinken on April 29 regarding Tigrayan for Ethiopia. I think the statement was – I hope you have seen it, I believe. But on the statement was given, it says Ethiopia’s conflict since like most of the statement was given, it says conflict. But 10 months ago, when he appears in front the lawmakers to make a statement, he did mention by saying ethnic cleansing. But when it says conflict, it seems to make the situation in east Africa and even Tigray and the whole – seems to – not a conflict but as an actual war. So I was wondering why the word was lowered from ethnic cleansing to conflict. It seems to most Tigrayans and around the world was asked – made in statements on Twitter. So that’s the comment that was on Twitter that was based on the Secretary of State made the statement there is a piece that the coming – direction is going. But has anyone spoke to the Tigray region? Have he visited, just like he visited Ukraine? Has anyone – has a State Department official visited in Tigray region, as has only visited in Addis Ababa?</p>
<p>The second question I have is regarding the Tigrayan general, former general commander, which he used to be an African Union mission in Somalia, which he has worked with U.S. African Command, which is AFRICOM. He just passed away in the custody of Ethiopian Government. As you know, al-Shabaab was a threat to U.S. security. So this commander has worked shoulder to shoulder with American officials and service folks, and so have you heard or are you going to ask the death – the cause of the death? Because some said that he was poisoned or so, but I’m not ready to confirm that, but I just wanted to make sure if you know about from the general commander government, Fikadu. It’s is spelled G-e-b-r-e-m-e-d-h-i-n. Last name is F-i-k-a-d-u, Fikadu. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><a id="post-341695-Ethiopia"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Endale. To your most recent question on the cause of death, I’m actually just learning of these reports. So if we have anything to share, we’ll certainly update you and get back to you.</p>
<p>To your first question regarding the conflict in Ethiopia, I certainly don’t have any travel to announce for the Secretary. But what I would underscore from here is what we’ve said previously, in that we’re encouraged that the Government of Ethiopia as well as regional authorities in Tigray and Afar have taken steps to enable the delivery of desperately needed food and aid in the war-affected communities. And we also urge parties to accelerate, uphold, and expand these efforts to ensure, as President Biden has said, the immediate, sustained, and unimpeded humanitarian access to all Ethiopians who are impacted by this conflict.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Shannon Crawford.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks so much for briefing. I just wanted to ask: Are there any updates on the Victory Day show of support for Ukraine from the U.S. and its allies that Ned previewed yesterday? Specifically, can we expect that announcement to come from the State Department or the White House?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Shannon. We don’t have anything to share at the moment, but I imagine you’ll be hearing something pretty soon. Thank you.</p>
<p>Let’s go over to Eunjung Cho.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Jalina. Thank you for taking my question. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Yes, I can hear you, Eunjung.</p>
<p><a id="post-341695-NorthKorea"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you. The CNN reports quoting three U.S. officials that the U.S. military and intelligence agencies assess that North Korea could be ready to conduct a nuclear test by the end of this month. Does the State Department hold the same assessment that North Korea could be ready for a nuclear test by the end of this month?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Eunjung. The United States assesses that the DPRK is preparing its Punggye-ri test site and could be ready to conduct a test there as early as this month, which would be its seventh test. This assessment is consistent with the DPRK’s own recent public statements.</p>
<p>We’ve shared this information with allies and partners, and we’ll continue closely coordinating with them as well. We’ll also build on this close coordination when the President travels to the Republic of Korea and Japan later this month to strengthen our alliances and demonstrate our commitment to their security is ironclad.</p>
<p>I’ll have the operator repeat the instructions on if anyone wants to get in the Q&amp;A queue.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATOR:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your telephone keypad.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Let’s go over to Rosiland Jordan.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, Jalina. Happy Friday. I wanted to get an update on the Secretary’s health, what he’s been doing today. Has he had any engagements on Ukraine or on Russia?</p>
<p>And separately, is there any update on the status of Brittney Griner and other Americans being held in Russia? Thanks.</p>
<p><a id="post-341695-Department"></a><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Ros. The Secretary continues to experience mild symptoms, but we don’t have anything to read out from today.</p>
<p><a id="post-341695-Russia"></a> And on to your question about Brittney Griner and others who are detained in Russia, what we’ve said and will continue to say from here is that we have no other priority than the safety and security of the United States citizens who are overseas, and we continue to insist that the Government of Russia allow for consistent and timely consular access to all U.S. citizens – U.S. citizen detainees in Russia, including those in pretrial detention – in compliance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and bilateral consular convention with the United States. Our requests for access are consistently delayed or denied, and we will continue to press for fair and transparent treatment for all U.S. citizen detainees in Russia.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Matt Lee.</p>
<p><a id="post-341695-NorthKorea2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thank you, Jalina. I’m sorry, I’m on my cell phone and it cut out like three quarters of your response to that question on North Korea. I just want to – could you repeat that, your answer?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Matt. I think you’re referring to Eunjung’s question. What we said before is that the United States assesses that the DPRK is preparing its Punggye-ri test site and could be ready to conduct a test there as early as this month, which would be its seventh test. This assessment is also consistent with the DPRK’s own recent public statements. We’ve shared this information with allies and partners and will continue to closely coordinate with them, and we’ll also build on this close coordination when the President travels to the Republic of Korea and Japan later this month to strengthen our alliances and demonstrate that our commitment to their security is ironclad.</p>
<p>Let’s go over to Paulina Smolinski.</p>
<p><a id="post-341695-Russia2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on the Brittney Griner statement. Do you guys have any (inaudible), any comment on former U.S. Ambassador to the UN Bill Richardson helping out with this?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> If we still have you, Paulina, do you mind repeating your question a tad bit louder, please?</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Sorry. Do you have any comment on reports that former U.S. Ambassador to the UN Bill Richardson is helping with Brittney Griner’s case?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Paulina. We don’t have any updates to share on her specific case. We continue to be in contact with her legal team, and, of course, we continue to press again for fair treatment for not only her, but all U.S. citizen detainees in Russia.</p>
<p>Let’s go back over to Shannon Crawford.</p>
<p><a id="post-341695-Sanctions"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Thanks again. I just wanted to ask about those sanctions on the cryptocurrency Blender – cryptocurrency mixer Blender, excuse me. Do you – does the State Department think that is going to be effective, and is it pushing for more proactive measures to stop this illicit financial activity before it takes place?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Shannon. We don’t have anything further to announce, but I would say as a result of today’s action, all property and interest in the property of the entity of Blender.io that’s in the United States or in possession or control of U.S. persons is blocked and must be reported to OFAC, or the Office of Foreign Asset Control. In addition, any entities that are owned directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked.</p>
<p>We’ll take the final question back to Rosiland Jordan.</p>
<p><a id="post-341695-Department2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hey, thanks again. Completely different topic: The U.S. Government, as do many other governments, use social media in order to connect with its citizens. In light of Elon Musk’s attempt to buy Twitter, there is a lot of discussion about how much control one private citizen should have over what is a de facto public space. Is there that concern within the State Department that a private citizen, no matter who it is, could decide who has access to this platform, could possibly interfere with the communication between a government and its citizens? And is the State Department looking at alternatives to using Twitter should this purchase go through? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Ros. We use a range of platforms from the State Department, which would include Twitter and other social media platforms, not only to connect with Americans but to connect with the global community abroad. I don’t have anything to share from here. It wouldn’t be appropriate for me to share whether that would change or whether we would interfere in a platform as large as Twitter, but we certainly appreciate that we do have that platform and are able to connect not only with other governments, but the American people and the global community.</p>
<p>Thank you all for joining today. That concludes today’s briefing. I hope you have a wonderful weekend ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:20 p.m.)</p>

Do you – does the State Department think that is going to be effective, and is it pushing for more proactive measures to stop this illicit financial activity before it takes place?</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Shannon. We don’t have anything further to announce, but I would say as a result of today’s action, all property and interest in the property of the entity of Blender.io that’s in the United States or in possession or control of U.S. persons is blocked and must be reported to OFAC, or the Office of Foreign Asset Control. In addition, any entities that are owned directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked.</p>
<p>We’ll take the final question back to Rosiland Jordan.</p>
<p><a id="post-341695-Department2"></a><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Hey, thanks again. Completely different topic: The U.S. Government, as do many other governments, use social media in order to connect with its citizens. In light of Elon Musk’s attempt to buy Twitter, there is a lot of discussion about how much control one private citizen should have over what is a de facto public space. Is there that concern within the State Department that a private citizen, no matter who it is, could decide who has access to this platform, could possibly interfere with the communication between a government and its citizens? And is the State Department looking at alternatives to using Twitter should this purchase go through? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>MS PORTER:</strong> Thanks, Ros. We use a range of platforms from the State Department, which would include Twitter and other social media platforms, not only to connect with Americans but to connect with the global community abroad. I don’t have anything to share from here. It wouldn’t be appropriate for me to share whether that would change or whether we would interfere in a platform as large as Twitter, but we certainly appreciate that we do have that platform and are able to connect not only with other governments, but the American people and the global community.</p>
<p>Thank you all for joining today. That concludes today’s briefing. I hope you have a wonderful weekend ahead.</p>
<p>(The briefing was concluded at 2:20 p.m.)</p>
