					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Treaty Room</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good morning, everyone.  It’s a real pleasure to be here with my friend and colleague, the foreign minister of Indonesia.  Retno, thank you for being here, but thank you more broadly for Indonesia’s remarkable leadership.  We just had – we’re still having what is truly a historic summit between the United States and ASEAN.  And the success of this effort is in no small measure due to Indonesia’s leadership as our country coordinator, but also as the leader of ASEAN.  I know from speaking to President Biden that the meetings have been already a significant success.  And it just puts an emphasis on the great importance that we attach, the United States attaches to ASEAN, our relationship, ASEAN centrality.  But so much of this is due to Indonesia’s leadership.</p>
<p>We are working together across the board to advance a shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region.  We’re working to strengthen economic ties among countries in the region.  We’re working together to deal with global challenges, like COVID-19.  Just yesterday at the summit that the President was also convening, I had the opportunity to do a session with your health minister about how we can strengthen the global health security system for the future.  So here, again, Indonesia is playing a leadership role.</p>
<p>We have a lot to talk about, including the situation in Myanmar and other occupations, but I think most important is that what I’ve seen over the last year and a half is a increasingly strong relationship, partnership between our countries, for which the United States is truly appreciative.  So welcome.  It’s great to have you.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MARSUDI:</strong>  Well, thank you very much, Secretary Blinken.  Thank you very much, Tony.  It’s very – I feel so glad to be back to D.C. again, and this time is for the ASEAN-U.S. Summit.  And I’m also very glad that we are able to have separately a bilateral meeting to discuss various issues of bilateral relation as well as regional and global issue.</p>
<p>U.S. and Indonesia are strategic partner.  With this strategic partnership, I am very glad to see intensified communication and cooperation between our two countries.  And we should use this strategic partnership also to contribute to the peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>So, I also hope to see synergy between the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework with implementation of cooperation under the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>On the global issue, I would like to reiterate the very consistent of the principle of Indonesia on the importance of respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty of a country to another country.  So, this principle is upheld by Indonesia very consistently.</p>
<p>Our hope is to see the war in Ukraine stop as soon as possible, and we give the peaceful resolution of a conflict a chance to succeed.  Because we know that if the war continues, all of us will suffer.</p>
<p>And finally, looking forward to welcoming you on the foreign ministers meeting of the G20 in July 2022 in Bali.</p>
<p>So once again, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you very much, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER MARSUDI:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Come on in.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The text of the following statement was released by the G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union.</p>
<p><i>Begin Text.</i></p>
<p>We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, express our strongest opposition and deplore the increasing restrictions imposed on the rights and freedoms of women and girls in Afghanistan by the Taliban.</p>
<p>We stand with the Afghan people in their demand for equal rights in line with the Taliban’s commitments to all Afghans and Afghanistan’s obligations under international law. We condemn the imposition of increasingly restrictive measures that severely limit half the population’s ability to fully, equally, and meaningfully participate in society, including the recent announcement on women’s appearance in public along with new punishments for family members to enforce compliance with these restrictions.</p>
<p>With these moves, the Taliban are further isolating themselves from the international community. Echoing our joint statement, together with Norway, from March 24, we call on the Taliban to urgently take steps to lift restrictions on women and girls, respect their human rights, and meet the expectations of Afghans and the world to permit their full, equal, and meaningful participation in work, education and public life, as well as freedom of movement and freedom of speech, which is crucial for long-term peace, stability and development of the country.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Treaty Room</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It’s a really great pleasure to welcome my colleague, my friend, the deputy prime minister, Don here to the State Department in Washington.  I’m particularly eager to continue the very good conversations we started in the fall.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER PRAMUDWINAI:</b>  Yes.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  We were supposed to continue them during a trip that I was making to Thailand.  Unfortunately, that was – that trip was shortened by COVID.  This meeting was almost shortened by COVID, but happily I’m back in time to receive my friend.</p>
<p>This is a momentous week with the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit, and we’re gratified to have Thailand here in Washington for that.  Also in your leadership year of APEC, which we’ll be taking on &#8212;</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER PRAMUDWINAI:</b>  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  &#8212; after you finish.  But a very strong shared agenda for a stable, peaceful Indo-Pacific that we’ll be working on.  We just came off of the first joint Strategic and Defense Dialogue between our countries, that I think was very successful, and I welcome you here to pursue the conversations we’ve been having.  Welcome.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER PRAMUDWINAI:</b>  Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, very nice to see you, members of the press, for the second time.  The first time was when I was here bilaterally, but this time around it was for the ASEAN 45th anniversary, a special leaders meeting.  But I’m glad I’m part of it, and then we can continue where we left off last time.</p>
<p>You mentioned about APEC.  Yes, definitely, we will be hosting it in November, and then you will take over chairmanship.</p>
<p>We have a lot more things to talk about, including the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.</p>
<p>So let me assure that this encounter that we are having now will be much more productive than last time.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good.  Thank you.  Thank you, everyone.</p>

<p align="left">By arresting Cardinal Joseph Zen, Margaret Ng, Hui Po-keung, and Denise Ho under the National Security Law, Hong Kong authorities have again demonstrated they will pursue all means necessary to stifle dissent and undercut protected rights and freedoms.  Hui Po-keung&#8217;s arrest at Hong Kong International Airport prior to his departure further indicates local authorities maintain a politically motivated exit ban on certain residents. These individuals served as trustees of the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, which helped thousands of arrested Hong Kong democracy protestors access funds for medical aid, legal advice, psychological counseling, and emergency financial relief.</p>
<p align="left">We call for the immediate release of those who remain in custody and continue to stand with people in Hong Kong.</p>
