					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of any person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of a foreign government, participates in malicious cyber activities against U.S. critical infrastructure in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).</p>
<p>Certain malicious cyber operations targeting U.S. critical infrastructure may violate the CFAA. Violations of the statute may include transmitting extortion threats as part of ransomware attacks; intentional unauthorized access to a computer or exceeding authorized access and thereby obtaining information from any protected computer; and knowingly causing the transmission of a program, information, code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, intentionally causing damage without authorization to a protected computer. Protected computers include not only U.S. government and financial institution computer systems, but also those used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication.</p>
<p>Commensurate with the seriousness with which we view these cyber threats, the Rewards for Justice program has set up a Dark Web (Tor-based) tips-reporting channel to protect the safety and security of potential sources. The RFJ program also is working with interagency partners to enable the rapid processing of information as well as the possible relocation of and payment of rewards to sources. Reward payments may include payments in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>More information about this reward offer is located on the Rewards for Justice website at <a class="external-link" href="https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">www.rewardsforjustice.net</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>. We encourage anyone with information on malicious cyber activity, carried out against U.S. critical infrastructure in violation of the CFAA by actors at the direction of or under the control of a foreign government, to contact the Rewards for Justice office via our Tor-based tips-reporting channel at: he5dybnt7sr6cm32xt77pazmtm65flqy6irivtflruqfc5ep7eiodiad.onion (Tor browser required).</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1984, the program has paid in excess of $200 million to more than 100 people across the globe who provided actionable information that helped prevent terrorism, bring terrorist leaders to justice, and resolve threats to U.S. national security. Follow us on Twitter at <a class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://twitter.com/RFJ_USA</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>At the 47th session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), June 21 – July 14, the United States pushed forward on priority issues as an observer state while actively pursuing election to the Council for the 2022-2024 term.  We continued to model the integrity we intend to bring to Council leadership, recognizing that we are most credible and effective in our international engagement when we remain forthright about our own human rights struggles.  During HRC 47, the United States helped advance resolutions, joint statements, and interventions responding to dire human rights situations.</p>
<p><strong>Countering Systemic Racism:  </strong>Building off the U.S.-led joint statement on racial justice at HRC 46, the United States looks forward to cooperating with a new mechanism on systemic racism to advance racial justice and equality in the context of law enforcement.  We welcome the High Commissioner’s report underscoring that systemic racism demands a systemic response and calling for an agenda that promotes accountability and redress for victims.</p>
<p><strong>Elimination of Violence Against Women and Girls:  </strong>The United States co-sponsored a resolution on “Accelerating efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: preventing and responding to violence against women and girls with disabilities,” led by Canada.  The resolution urges stakeholders to address the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination that women and girls with disabilities face.  We also support the ongoing work of the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, Dubravka Simonovic.</p>
<p><strong>Human Rights on the Internet:</strong>  The United States re-joined the core group and served as a main co-sponsor for a resolution on the promotion, protection, and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet, along with Sweden, Brazil, Nigeria, and Tunisia.  The resolution affirms that the same rights people have offline must be protected online and includes thematic focuses on bridging the digital divide and the importance of the internet during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Ethiopia’s Tigray Region:  </strong>The United States co-sponsored the EU-led resolution on human rights in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, which calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the swift, verifiable withdrawal of Eritrean troops, and the holding accountable those responsible for human rights abuses and violations.  The resolution builds upon the ongoing OHCHR-Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) joint investigation, requests the High Commissioner keep the Council updated on progress of the joint investigation, and keeps the situation in Ethiopia’s Tigray region on the HRC’s agenda for upcoming sessions.</p>
<p>The United States also co-sponsored resolutions on the human rights situations in <strong>Eritrea, Belarus, and Syria</strong>, along with resolutions on the <strong>Right to Education; Right to Education for Girls; Civil Society Space; Preventable Maternal Mortality and Morbidity; Human Rights of Migrants; New and Emerging Digital Technologies and Human Rights; and Technical Assistance and Capacity Building for Ukraine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joint Statements:</strong>  Overall, the United States signed onto 16 thematic or country-specific joint statements.  The United States joined 43 countries in co-signing a Canada-led joint statement expressing concern over human rights abuses in <strong>Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong</strong>.  The United States also signed onto country-specific joint statements on <strong>Belarus, Iraq, Nicaragua, </strong>and <strong>Venezuela.  </strong>We led a statement on <strong>the 10th anniversary of the UN Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on Business and Human Rights (BHR)</strong>, signed by 50 countries<strong>.</strong>  We supported a Norway-led joint statement reaffirming the UN’s role in promoting and defending <strong>democracy</strong>, which garnered signatures from 64 countries.  We also joined statements on the<strong> Freedom Online Coalition; announcing the creation of the Group of Friends on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity; disinformation and freedom of expression; violence against transgender women; female genital mutilation; sexual and reproductive health and rights; promoting human rights through sport; and the economic rights of women. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Side Events:  </strong>On June 22, the United States co-hosted a side event on the global <strong>#MeToo movement </strong>with the Executive Director of Georgetown’s Institute for Women, Peace, and Security, Melanne Verveer.  On June 23, the United States led, and 20 countries co-sponsored, its <strong>first-ever side event on the human rights of transgender women</strong>, highlighting the violence and structural, legal, and intersectional barriers faced by transgender women of color.  On July 1, the United States led a side event on<strong> </strong>the impact of<strong> Hong Kong’s National Security Law</strong> on its one-year anniversary, garnering 20 government and nine NGO co-sponsors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, DC</p>
<p>French Ambassador’s Residence</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  (Speaks in French.)</p>
<p>(In English) And it’s wonderful to see so many friends here this afternoon.  The rain is about to come down on us.  I will do my best to be brief.</p>
<p>But the individual who first had the idea for the statue was actually a history professor and a jurist from the <em>College de France</em>, Edouard Rene Lefebvre de Laboulaye.  Early in his studies, Laboulaye became enamored with the American Revolution and the country’s experiment in democracy, which he saw as a model for France.</p>
<p>I hope everyone else is getting protected too.  (Laughter.)  It’s very unfair.</p>
<p>But when a coup led to a return to the French monarchy, a climate of political repression and self-censorship set in, and Laboulaye stopped writing and lecturing on America.</p>
<p>Two events rekindled his flame.</p>
<p>The first was the American Civil War, which Laboulaye saw as an existential threat to the world’s greatest example of self-government.</p>
<p>The second was a visit in 1861 from an American diplomat and anti-slavery advocate, John Bigelow, who had been dispatched by President Lincoln to drum up support for the North, at a time when both the French Government and public largely sympathized with the South.</p>
<p>Bigelow wanted Laboulaye to write and speak out more for the Union cause and against slavery, and brought along resources from the State Department to sponsor the effort.  Laboulaye refused the support, the resources, but he told Bigelow, and I quote, that he’d “be charmed to serve a cause which is the cause of all  the friends of liberty.”</p>
<p>And he did serve the cause.  He churned out articles, pamphlets, books on how slavery threatened the ideals at the core of America’s democracy.  People crammed into his lectures, which, like his writing, was impassioned, persuasive.  And not only for people in France, but for Americans too.  Arguably no individual did more to win French support for the Union.</p>
<p>Of course, even if America was his subject, Laboulaye was never writing only about the United States.</p>
<p>He was also making the case implicitly for French democracy, and for what he saw as the universal aspiration of human beings to be free to chart their own course.  As he wrote, and I quote, “One is never cured of a yearning for freedom.”  He saw these principles as a joint heritage, French and American.</p>
<p>And, in a way, that’s how it’s always been for our two nations.  Our revolutions were over a dozen years apart, but the trajectories of our experiments in self-government – and their shared foundation in freedom and in human rights – they’ve always been intertwined.  Throughout our history, in many ways we’ve been mirrors to one another, holding up not only our greatest achievements but also our greatest flaws.</p>
<p>The same is true for Liberty That Lights the World.  For as long as she’s stood, she’s forced us to reconcile with the gap between our ideals and our reality; between who we are and who we strive to be.</p>
<p>Including the struggle for equality.  An editorial published in a black-owned newspaper days after the statue was unveiled captured this sentiment, and I quote:</p>
<p><em>“Shove the statue, torch and all, into the ocean until the same ‘liberty’ of this country…make it possible for an industrious and inoffensive colored man in the south to earn a respectable living, without being ku-kluxed, perhaps murdered, his daughter and wife outraged.”</em></p>
<p>Yet in a way, that’s exactly what the statue was intended to do: to project outwards and inwards our values and where we’re falling short.</p>
<p>That’s the journey of America, that’s the journey of France, that’s the journey of all free democracies: not the perfect embodiment of principled self-government, but the perpetual effort to fix our flaws and, as we like to say in the United States, “to form a more perfect Union.”</p>
<p>In this journey, the United States has no greater or more enduring ally than France.  It’s impossible to imagine the success of revolutions and emergence of our democracies without the people of our nations believing – and being willing to give their lives – for similar ideals.</p>
<p>From the Revolutionary War to World War II; from the fight against slavery to the fight against fascism.  We see it today, too, in the joint effort to tackle the climate crisis, to beat back this deadly pandemic, to remedy deep inequality.  And Jean-Yves captured it so well.</p>
<p>It’s the reason that France and the United States are working more closely than ever to lead our allies and partners around the world to defend and strengthen our democracies, whether that’s by revitalizing or modernizing NATO; deepening our cooperation with the European Union; working together at the United Nations and other multilateral institutions to uphold the international rules-based order that’s been the basis for unprecedented security and prosperity since 1945.</p>
<p>It’s why we’re working together to push back against economic coercion and promote new global norms to address 21st century threats such as cyber attacks and disinformation.</p>
<p>And it’s why we continue to invest in efforts to advance freedom and human rights around the world, including safeguarding a free, independent press and shoring up the rule of law, because our shared experience has taught us that these institutions are some of the best guardrails of democracy, and that every nation needs help along the way.</p>
<p>As Jean-Yves mentioned, before this ceremony we had the immense honor of seeing four American veterans of World War Two receive <em>la Legion d&#8217;honneur</em>.  One of them, William Allison, was just 17 years old when he enlisted to serve.  When he and his battalion arrived in Marseille in 1944, a Frenchwoman who had come out to welcome them exclaimed, “My god, they’re children.”</p>
<p>But these young Americans would go on to help liberate France, fight valiantly along the Maginot Line, and clear deadly mines that allowed the French people to return to their homes.  To William, the most gratifying moment of his service came when he freed a group of French prisoners from a Nazi labor camp near Munich.  In other words, his greatest achievement was restoring freedom.  <em>Liberte</em>.</p>
<p><em>Liberte</em> and <em>egalite</em> – they translate very easily into English.  But there’s no single word in English – brotherhood, sisterhood, solidarity, fraternity – that I think perfectly captures the essence of <em>fraternite</em>.</p>
<p>But I think it’s fair to say that <em>fraternite</em> is the word that best defines the relationship between our people, and our ongoing struggle to improve our democracies and advance the ideals embodied in the light that shines the world &#8212; at home and around the world.</p>
<p>So may she continue remind us of the principles we share and the work that remains to live up to them. And may we never be cured of yearning for freedom.</p>
<p>Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
