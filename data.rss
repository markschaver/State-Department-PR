					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of United States of America, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to His Majesty the Emperor of Japan on the occasion of his 62nd birthday this February 23.  As His Majesty reflected in his New Year’s message, overcoming many of the global challenges we face today starts with cherishing our people-to-people connections.  Maintaining the strength of the U.S.-Japan Alliance and our treasured friendship with the Japanese people has never more been more important.</p>
<p>As Secretary Austin and I reaffirmed in our meeting with Foreign Minister Hayashi and Minister of Defense Kishi last month, the U.S.-Japan Alliance is the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in a free and open Indo-Pacific.  Together, the United States and Japan will continue to advance our shared vision of a world that is open, connected, prosperous, resilient, and secure.  We look forward to deepening our cherished partnership with the people of Japan and continuing our efforts to strengthen and modernize the U.S.-Japan Alliance in the year ahead.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>As part of its interagency coordination responsibilities for the preservation of cultural heritage, the U.S. Department of State announces the imposition of unilateral restrictions on the importation of certain categories of Afghan archaeological and ethnological material into the United States.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, the Department of State determined that circumstances in Afghanistan warrant unilateral emergency import restrictions. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of the Treasury published the import restrictions in the February 22, 2022, Federal Register, and the import restrictions are effective immediately.</p>
<p>These import restrictions are intended to prevent illicitly trafficked materials from entering the U.S. art market, thus reducing the incentive for pillage of Afghanistan’s cultural heritage and combatting profit from the sale of these cultural objects by terrorists and criminal organizations.</p>
<p>Additional information, including the Designated List describing the types of objects or categories of material subject to import restrictions, can be found in the <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-08-15/pdf/2016-19491.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">Federal Register</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a>.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today marks six years since the Iranian government wrongfully detained Baquer Namazi solely for the purpose of using him as a political pawn.  In 2016, Baquer Namazi was arrested after traveling to Iran to help free his son, wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Siamak Namazi.  Both father and son were sentenced to ten years in prison on baseless charges.  Despite commuting Baquer’s sentence in 2020, the Iranian government still refuses to allow him to depart Iran.  Now 85 years old, Baquer needs specialized medical care and continues to be separated from his grandchildren and the rest of his family in the United States.</p>
<p>We call on the Iranian government to allow Baquer Namazi to return home, and release his son Siamak, as well as their fellow U.S. citizens Emad Shargi and Morad Tahbaz, who is also a U.K. citizen.  Iran’s wrongful detention of U.S. citizens for use as political leverage is outrageous.  Our priority is bringing all our wrongfully detained citizens home safely and as soon as possible  and resolving the cases of missing and abducted U.S. citizens, including Bob Levinson.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>We strongly condemn President Putin’s decision to recognize the so-called “Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics” as “independent.”  As we said when the Duma first made its request: this decision represents a complete rejection of Russia’s commitments under the Minsk agreements, directly contradicts Russia’s claimed commitment to diplomacy, and is a clear attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>States have an obligation not to recognize a new “state” created through the threat or use of force, as well as an obligation not to disrupt another state’s borders.  Russia’s decision is yet another example of President Putin’s flagrant disrespect for international law and norms.</p>
<p>President Biden will sign an Executive Order that will prohibit all new investment, trade, and financing by U.S. persons to, from, or in the so-called “Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics” regions of Ukraine. We will continue to coordinate with Ukraine and our Allies and partners to take appropriate steps in response to this unprovoked and unacceptable action by Russia. The E.O. is designed to prevent Russia from profiting off of this blatant violation of international law. It is not directed at the people of Ukraine or the Ukrainian government and will allow humanitarian and other related activity to continue in these regions.</p>
<p>Our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as for the government and people of Ukraine is unwavering.  We stand with our Ukrainian partners in strongly condemning President Putin’s announcement.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We go now to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was also in Munich and is here in Washington this morning.  Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good morning, Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  President Biden says Vladimir Putin has made up his mind to invade.  But we spoke with Russia’s ambassador earlier this morning, and he insists there’s no invasion, no plan to invade, and only has troops on his own soil.  Do you have reason to believe Vladimir Putin is changing his mind?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  No, we don’t.  As President Biden said the other night, everything we’re seeing tells us that the decision we believe President Putin has made to invade is moving forward.  We’ve seen that with provocations created by the Russian or separatist forces over the weekend, false flag operations.  Now the news just this morning that the quote, unquote “exercises” Russia was engaged in in Belarus with 30,000 Russian forces that were supposed to end this weekend will now continue because of tensions in eastern Ukraine, tensions created by Russia and the separatist forces it backs there.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We understand President Biden is calling a meeting of his National Security Council today.  What decisions will be made at that meeting?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, it’s an opportunity to review the latest information, the latest intelligence, to check signals, to check plans.  I just came back from Munich with the Vice President.  She led our delegation there to make sure that we are in lockstep with allies and partners on everything that we’re going to do both to see if we can still prevent President Putin from carrying forth his decision, and if not, making sure that we’re fully coordinated with allies and partners on the response.  They reiterated that massive consequences will follow if President Putin carries forth with the aggression.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Well, when we last spoke on January 23rd, you told me that if Russia engages in other tactics short of invasion – hybrid actions, cyber attacks, efforts to bring the government down – there will be a swift, calibrated, and united response.  Aren’t they doing all of those things right now?  And where is the U.S. response?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>First of all, we’ve taken significant action over the – in recent months supplying Ukraine with more defensive – lethal defensive assistance over the last year than at any previous years.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  But those cyber attacks were just attributed by the White House on Friday.  Those just happened.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  And we’ve worked closely with Ukraine to ward them off, to get back up and running.  We’ve now made an attribution to Russia for those cyber attacks.  We’re looking closely at the response that that may call for.  And we’re doing all of this in coordination with allies and partners.  If Russia commits the aggression that may be in train, all of that has been part of our plan, and we’re carrying it forward.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  You said that you will meet with Russia’s top diplomat, but only if Russia does not invade.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  But it seems contradictory because what you are saying is that’s tanks and that’s planes, but does that mean Russia has carte blanche to continue cyber attacks, to continue funding separatists in the east?  If they keep tensions at this low boil, is that acceptable to you?  Will you still sit down and negotiate?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  It’s – it’s not acceptable.  Two things.  There are two separate things there.</p>
<p>First of all, it’s not acceptable, and it’s one of the things that we’ve talked about in some detail with allies and partners this weekend.  That is a scenario by which Russia just keeps things at a low or medium boil, and there will be a response to that, too.</p>
<p>But in terms of engaging Russia, my job as a diplomat is to leave absolutely no stone unturned and see if we can prevent a war.  And if there’s anything that I can do to do that, I’m going to do it.  President Biden has made very clear that he’s prepared to meet President Putin at any time in any format if that can help prevent a war.  And as long as – even if the die is cast, until it’s settled, until we know that the tanks are rolling, the planes are flying, and the aggression has fully begun, we’re going to do everything we can to prevent it.</p>
<p>But we’re prepared either way, and we’re prepared with a response that will have massive consequences for Russia if it actually carries this through.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  You have consistently described sanctions as a deterrent, but I know you heard President Zelenskyy really light into the Western allies in that speech in Munich.  And he accused you and the West of appeasement of Vladimir Putin over the past few years.  He said, “We don’t need your sanctions after the bombardment or after we have no borders or after we have no economy or after parts of our country will be occupied.  What are you waiting for?”</p>
<p>What are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I can’t speak, Margaret, to the last few years.  I can speak to the last few months and to the last year.  And in that period of time, the United States, again, has provided to Ukraine more assistance, including lethal military assistance, defense assistance, more in the past year than at any time in any previous year.  We have rallied other countries to stand in support of Ukraine, as well, to provide their own assistance.  We’ve rallied other countries to make clear and to put together in great detail the massive consequences that will befall Russia if it engages in this aggression.  The purpose of that is to do everything we can to deter it, to prevent a war, to deter the aggression.  And we don’t want to pull the trigger until we have to because we lose the deterrent effect.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also don’t want to detail in public exactly what we’re going to do because that will forewarn Russia; it will be able to prepare more effectively to try to mitigate the sanctions.  So, all of this is very well thought through.  And look, I recognize President Zelenskyy is in a very difficult position as the leader of a country that is under siege by Russia.  We are doing everything we can to both help Ukraine defend itself and to make clear what will happen to Russia if it undertakes this aggression.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  When I spoke with the Russian ambassador, he referred to Crimea, that part of southern Ukraine that was annexed by Russia in 2014, as part of the Russian Federation.  Will the U.S. in any way consider recognizing that, ceding that territory or any territories in the east of Ukraine, as a diplomatic way out to avoid a larger war?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  No.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  No.  Hard stop.  That is not up for negotiation.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  The President has said that the United States will continue to support Ukraine in the future after an invasion.  If there is an occupation, does that mean the United States is committed to funding and arming an insurgency?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  The President said that we will, in the event of an invasion, double down on our support for Ukraine, and that means in terms of security assistance, economic assistance, diplomatic assistance, political assistance, humanitarian assistance – you name it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Secretary Blinken, good luck this week.  Thank you for your time this morning.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thanks, Margaret.  Good to be with you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We go now to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was also in Munich and is here in Washington this morning.  Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Good morning, Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  President Biden says Vladimir Putin has made up his mind to invade.  But we spoke with Russia’s ambassador earlier this morning, and he insists there’s no invasion, no plan to invade, and only has troops on his own soil.  Do you have reason to believe Vladimir Putin is changing his mind?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  No, we don’t.  As President Biden said the other night, everything we’re seeing tells us that the decision we believe President Putin has made to invade is moving forward.  We’ve seen that with provocations created by the Russian or separatist forces over the weekend, false flag operations.  Now the news just this morning that the quote, unquote “exercises” Russia was engaged in in Belarus with 30,000 Russian forces that were supposed to end this weekend will now continue because of tensions in eastern Ukraine, tensions created by Russia and the separatist forces it backs there.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  We understand President Biden is calling a meeting of his National Security Council today.  What decisions will be made at that meeting?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, it’s an opportunity to review the latest information, the latest intelligence, to check signals, to check plans.  I just came back from Munich with the Vice President.  She led our delegation there to make sure that we are in lockstep with allies and partners on everything that we’re going to do both to see if we can still prevent President Putin from carrying forth his decision, and if not, making sure that we’re fully coordinated with allies and partners on the response.  They reiterated that massive consequences will follow if President Putin carries forth with the aggression.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Well, when we last spoke on January 23rd, you told me that if Russia engages in other tactics short of invasion – hybrid actions, cyber attacks, efforts to bring the government down – there will be a swift, calibrated, and united response.  Aren’t they doing all of those things right now?  And where is the U.S. response?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>First of all, we’ve taken significant action over the – in recent months supplying Ukraine with more defensive – lethal defensive assistance over the last year than at any previous years.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  But those cyber attacks were just attributed by the White House on Friday.  Those just happened.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  And we’ve worked closely with Ukraine to ward them off, to get back up and running.  We’ve now made an attribution to Russia for those cyber attacks.  We’re looking closely at the response that that may call for.  And we’re doing all of this in coordination with allies and partners.  If Russia commits the aggression that may be in train, all of that has been part of our plan, and we’re carrying it forward.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  You said that you will meet with Russia’s top diplomat, but only if Russia does not invade.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  But it seems contradictory because what you are saying is that’s tanks and that’s planes, but does that mean Russia has carte blanche to continue cyber attacks, to continue funding separatists in the east?  If they keep tensions at this low boil, is that acceptable to you?  Will you still sit down and negotiate?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  It’s – it’s not acceptable.  Two things.  There are two separate things there.</p>
<p>First of all, it’s not acceptable, and it’s one of the things that we’ve talked about in some detail with allies and partners this weekend.  That is a scenario by which Russia just keeps things at a low or medium boil, and there will be a response to that, too.</p>
<p>But in terms of engaging Russia, my job as a diplomat is to leave absolutely no stone unturned and see if we can prevent a war.  And if there’s anything that I can do to do that, I’m going to do it.  President Biden has made very clear that he’s prepared to meet President Putin at any time in any format if that can help prevent a war.  And as long as – even if the die is cast, until it’s settled, until we know that the tanks are rolling, the planes are flying, and the aggression has fully begun, we’re going to do everything we can to prevent it.</p>
<p>But we’re prepared either way, and we’re prepared with a response that will have massive consequences for Russia if it actually carries this through.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  You have consistently described sanctions as a deterrent, but I know you heard President Zelenskyy really light into the Western allies in that speech in Munich.  And he accused you and the West of appeasement of Vladimir Putin over the past few years.  He said, “We don’t need your sanctions after the bombardment or after we have no borders or after we have no economy or after parts of our country will be occupied.  What are you waiting for?”</p>
<p>What are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  I can’t speak, Margaret, to the last few years.  I can speak to the last few months and to the last year.  And in that period of time, the United States, again, has provided to Ukraine more assistance, including lethal military assistance, defense assistance, more in the past year than at any time in any previous year.  We have rallied other countries to stand in support of Ukraine, as well, to provide their own assistance.  We’ve rallied other countries to make clear and to put together in great detail the massive consequences that will befall Russia if it engages in this aggression.  The purpose of that is to do everything we can to deter it, to prevent a war, to deter the aggression.  And we don’t want to pull the trigger until we have to because we lose the deterrent effect.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And joining me now is the Secretary of the State Antony Blinken.  Secretary Blinken, welcome back to Meet the Press.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks, Chuck.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Based on everything you had hinted at, and U.S. intelligence had hinted at, between yourself and the President, has the invasion already begun?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, it certainly looks like everything we said was likely to occur in the leadup to the actual invasion is happening.  We’re seeing false flag operations taking place in eastern Ukraine, the manufacturing of provocations and justifications for Russia to go in.  We just heard this morning that “exercises” that – and I put that in quotation marks – that Russia was engaged in in Belarus with 30,000 Russian forces that were supposed to end are now not ending because of the alleged tension in eastern Ukraine that, of course, is being created by Russia and its proxies there.</p>
<p>So, all of this seems to be following the script that I laid out at the United Nations Security Council and that President Biden talked about to the nation just the other day.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I want to get you to respond to President Zelenskyy in Munich over the last 24 hours.  He’s clearly frustrated, and he essentially said, well, if you’re so sure the invasion is here, you’re telling me that it’s 100 percent that the war will start in a couple of days, well, then, what are you waiting for?  He’s referring to the harsh sanctions, like it’s essentially if the war has begun, then let’s go.  Well?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  You also heard – Chuck, you also heard the President say that while the die may be cast, until it actually settles, until the tanks are rolling and the planes are in the air, that we’re going to try everything we possibly can to get President Putin to reverse the decision we believe he’s made and to dissuade him.  Part of that is the prospect of massive sanctions.  And just in Munich a day ago where we were all gathered, the G7 countries, the leading democratic economies in the world, reiterated very forcefully the massive consequences that would befall Russia and President Putin with sanctions if the aggression actually goes forward.</p>
<p>We continue to try to build everything we can to deter him from the course that he’s now set on.  And until the last minute, there is still an option to – for him to pull back.  That’s what we’re trying to do.  We’re trying to prevent a war.  As soon as you trigger the sanctions, of course, any deterrent effect they may have is gone.  They get absorbed by President Putin, and he moves on.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Why do you think Putin appears to not be taking these threats seriously?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, one of the challenges that we have, Chuck, I think, is that we all put our own frame of logic on what President Putin is doing that may not be the same frame that he has.  And it’s hard to put yourself in someone else’s mind, but he has decades of built-up grievances.  He has, I think, a conviction that Ukraine cannot in any way be Western-oriented, that it cannot be a successful democracy on his borders, and that fundamentally is what this is about.  He wants to reconstitute if not the Soviet empire at least a sphere of influence, and if not that at least to Finlandize his neighbors.</p>
<p>So, our logic is very different because what we’re seeing is President Putin precipitating everything he says he wants to prevent.  He’s alienated the Ukrainian people from Russia.  He’s actually caused NATO to bolster itself, and we’ll continue to do that, especially if the aggression actually goes forward.  And NATO is now closer to Russia than it was.  And so in terms of what would appear to us logically to be his interests, he is running – everything he is doing runs counter to them.  In his own logic, there may be a rationale.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  So, if he goes through with this invasion and he goes to Kyiv, as President Biden seemed to indicate that this isn’t going to be just a limited thing, that he’s going all-in to Kyiv, then is President Zelenskyy right when he said yesterday in Munich that the security architecture of our world is obsolete?</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  The architecture is not obsolete.  On the contrary, what we’re seeing is it’s actually being reinforced, again, largely because of what President Putin is doing.  I just came back from Munich.  I was with all our allies and partners along with the Vice President.  And what the Vice President said very forcefully in Munich, and what I heard in private from all of our partners, is that NATO now is – has more cohesion, more solidarity than it’s had at any time in recent memory.  Leading officials from Europe said that publicly.  The Vice President certainly heard that in her meetings and in the response to her speech.  So, I think we’re seeing NATO solidified, unified by the actions that President Putin has taken.</p>
<p>Now, having said that, this aggression from Russia against Ukraine is a direct challenge to the basic principles that have undergirded our security and our peace for decades, the notion that one country doesn’t simply go in and change the borders of another by force – that it doesn’t try to subjugate another country to its will, to force its decisions on another country, including with whom that country may associate.</p>
<p>So that’s exactly why we are all standing up and standing firmly against what Russia is doing, coming together not only in support of Ukraine but also to bolster NATO and to make it clear that there will be massive consequences for Russia if it continues down this course.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Look, President Zelenskyy also brought up the fact that this isn’t vague promises that the West made to Ukraine, that Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons.  And one of the reasons it – one of the prompt reassurances it got was essentially of protection from the West, from Europe, from the United States.  What do we owe Ukraine if Russia invades?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, first, Chuck, over the last year we’ve provided more than a billion dollars in assistance to Ukraine – in 2021, $650 million in security assistance, defensive lethal assistance.  That’s more in that year than in any previous year, along with humanitarian and economic assistance.  Just the other day we announced a billion-dollar loan guarantee for Ukraine.  We’ve been rallying other countries to do the same thing, to support it economically, militarily, diplomatically.  And if this aggression goes forward, that will continue.  Support for Ukraine across the board diplomatically, militarily, and economically will not only continue, it will deepen.  As the President said, we’ll double down on that.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Any Americans that – in Ukraine right now, will the United States Government do whatever it takes to get them out if war begins?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Chuck, we’ve been very clear for many, many weeks that in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine we will not be in a position to evacuate any remaining Americans from Ukraine.  I’ve said that repeatedly.  We’ve been in direct contact with every American we can possibly be in contact with – someone who is a resident, typically this is someone who is a long-term resident of Ukraine who happens to have an American passport.  We’ve communicated that directly to Congress.  We’ve urged them to communicate that to any Americans and groups that they’re in contact with.  We’ve been repeatedly clear about this, and we have seen people leave in recent weeks.</p>
<p>But we are not going to be in a position – our embassy is now shuttered in Kyiv.  We’ve moved it to Lviv toward – near the Polish border.  We are going to do everything we can to guide Americans who want to leave, to help them get out through – by telling them the best way to do that, to support them as best we can, to have consular services available for them, for example, along the border with Poland.  But in terms of an evacuation, that’s not going to happen.  And by the way, that almost never happens.  Every time in places around the world where for one reason or another we’ve had to shut down an embassy, Americans have remained.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  So, the President, President Biden, indicated that Americans probably should be prepared for perhaps higher gas prices for a short period of time, if these sanctions go through.  What about the issue of cyber attacks?  How concerned are you that the Russians are going to attack us in cyber, if you will, to try to dissuade us from helping the Ukrainians?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  It’s certainly part of their playbook.  And we’ve been engaged for many months now, first of all in helping Ukraine itself bolster its cyber defenses, and of course very much focused on doing the same for ourselves in anticipation of the possibility that Russia would engage in cyber attacks in response to us standing up to their aggression.  This is a very, very dangerous game.  We’re, as I said, strengthening our own defenses.</p>
<p>When President Biden was with President Putin in Geneva a few months ago – this was at the time of ransomware attacks, including the Colonial pipeline – and the President was conveying to President Putin how seriously we take this and the need for Russia to do something about it because those engaged in the attacks were doing it from Russian soil.  And he noted to President Putin that if he were in President Putin’s shoes with this large oil and gas infrastructure, he knows how difficult it would be for President Putin, if something were to happen to that infrastructure.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Let me ask this question.  In your assessment, why did Putin – why is he escalating with Ukraine now?  Why didn’t he do this under the previous administration who wasn’t as supportive of NATO?  If you just look at it observationally, if he really wanted Ukraine and he didn’t want the United States getting in the way, he perhaps had a – more of a friendlier administration in the previous one.  Why do you think he didn’t act then?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I hope you get a chance to ask him.  But look, here’s what I can say.  I think, and I really don’t want to put myself in his mind because that – it’s very hard to do.  But I think it’s reasonable to think that as President Putin sees it, Ukraine was slipping further and further away from his grasp over time, increasingly Western-oriented, desirous of a future with Europe.  And as that was continuing year after year – by the way, largely, again as a result of his actions and alienating the Ukrainians by seizing Crimea and invading via separatists the Donbas – as that was happening, it no doubt got to a point where he thought if he didn’t do something to change the dynamic, it was just going to happen.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  It feels like that your meeting with Sergey Lavrov this week, if it happens, it means no war; if it doesn’t happen, it means war has begun.  Is that the fair way to look at that meeting?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s a pretty good summary, Chuck, yes.  Look, we’re doing everything we can, and it’s my responsibility to do everything I can to try diplomatically to prevent a war.  And so, I will leave no stone unturned to do that.  I reached out to Foreign Minister Lavrov some days ago, suggested we meet this coming week in Europe to see if we can pursue conversations that would allow us to prevent a war and address the security concerns that we all have – the United States, Europe, and Russia – in that conversation.  He came back and said, yeah, let’s meet.  And we responded and said the meeting’s on provided you don’t invade Ukraine in the meantime.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  So right now, that meeting’s on?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Right now, that meeting’s on.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Okay.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Stay tuned over the next few days.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Appreciate you coming on and sharing your perspective with us.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks, Chuck.</p>

<p>When President Biden was with President Putin in Geneva a few months ago – this was at the time of ransomware attacks, including the Colonial pipeline – and the President was conveying to President Putin how seriously we take this and the need for Russia to do something about it because those engaged in the attacks were doing it from Russian soil.  And he noted to President Putin that if he were in President Putin’s shoes with this large oil and gas infrastructure, he knows how difficult it would be for President Putin, if something were to happen to that infrastructure.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Let me ask this question.  In your assessment, why did Putin – why is he escalating with Ukraine now?  Why didn’t he do this under the previous administration who wasn’t as supportive of NATO?  If you just look at it observationally, if he really wanted Ukraine and he didn’t want the United States getting in the way, he perhaps had a – more of a friendlier administration in the previous one.  Why do you think he didn’t act then?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  I hope you get a chance to ask him.  But look, here’s what I can say.  I think, and I really don’t want to put myself in his mind because that – it’s very hard to do.  But I think it’s reasonable to think that as President Putin sees it, Ukraine was slipping further and further away from his grasp over time, increasingly Western-oriented, desirous of a future with Europe.  And as that was continuing year after year – by the way, largely, again as a result of his actions and alienating the Ukrainians by seizing Crimea and invading via separatists the Donbas – as that was happening, it no doubt got to a point where he thought if he didn’t do something to change the dynamic, it was just going to happen.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  It feels like that your meeting with Sergey Lavrov this week, if it happens, it means no war; if it doesn’t happen, it means war has begun.  Is that the fair way to look at that meeting?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  That’s a pretty good summary, Chuck, yes.  Look, we’re doing everything we can, and it’s my responsibility to do everything I can to try diplomatically to prevent a war.  And so, I will leave no stone unturned to do that.  I reached out to Foreign Minister Lavrov some days ago, suggested we meet this coming week in Europe to see if we can pursue conversations that would allow us to prevent a war and address the security concerns that we all have – the United States, Europe, and Russia – in that conversation.  He came back and said, yeah, let’s meet.  And we responded and said the meeting’s on provided you don’t invade Ukraine in the meantime.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  So right now, that meeting’s on?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Right now, that meeting’s on.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Okay.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Stay tuned over the next few days.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Appreciate you coming on and sharing your perspective with us.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks, Chuck.</p>
