					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>In August 2021, as part of Vice President Kamala Harris’s trip to Singapore, the United States and Singapore agreed on the importance of creating a safe and transparent environment that facilitates space exploration, science, and commercial activities for all of humanity to enjoy. Vice President Harris and Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong discussed opportunities to expand bilateral cooperation in the field of space.</p>
<p>Today, as a product of that expanded dialogue and cooperation on space, Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong signed the Artemis Accords on behalf of the Republic of Singapore in a ceremony in Washington, DC.  This important statement of commitment to the peaceful and safe exploration of space was welcomed by Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary J.R. Littlejohn and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy.</p>
<p>Led by the Department of State and NASA, the Artemis Accords are grounded in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and promote values-based cooperation and encourage responsible and safe behavior in space.  These principles for space exploration also underpin NASA’s Artemis Program, which seeks to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon, while preparing to conduct a human mission to Mars.</p>
<p>Singapore is the 18th country to sign the Accords, joining Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  These nations are leading the world in operationalizing principles for the responsible exploration of space.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>President Biden believes deeply in the ability of U.S. global leadership to solve challenges, and the Administration recognizes that diplomacy and development are vital tools for advancing U.S. interests and values. That is why the Fiscal Year 2023 President’s Budget requests $60.4 billion for the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), $1.9 billion, or 3 percent, above the Fiscal Year 2022 Request, and $7.4 billion, or 14 percent, above FY 2021 enacted levels. With these resources, we can advance our foreign policy agenda and deliver for the American people.</p>
<p>The Budget will fund a range of Department of State and USAID priorities, including:</p>
<p><strong>Support for Ukraine and Our Allies and Partners in the Region</strong>: The Request includes $1.6 billion to support Ukraine against Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified invasion and assist other countries across Europe and Central Asia threatened by regional insecurity. The Request provides significant assistance to our allies and partners while building their capacity to counter actions from malign actors.</p>
<p><strong>Affirming U.S. Alliances and Renewing U.S. International Leadership</strong>: The Request maintains longstanding commitments to key partners; advances peace, prosperity, and security across the Indo-Pacific and Europe; expands diplomatic and development initiatives in Africa and Asia; and positions us to effectively compete with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Russia. This Request includes $4 billion to support U.S. commitments to international organizations and affirms U.S. leadership at a moment when our competitors are seeking to expand their influence.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing the Climate Crisis</strong>: The Request has $2.3 billion to support U.S. leadership in addressing the existential climate crisis through diplomacy; scaled-up international climate programs that accelerate the global energy transition to net zero by 2050; support to developing countries to enhance climate resilience; and the prioritization of climate adaptation and sustainability principles in Department and USAID domestic and overseas facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthening Global Health Systems</strong>: The United States is the international leader in advancing global health outcomes that benefit the American people and millions of others around the world. The Budget requests $10.6 billion in Department and USAID funding to continue to collaborate with international partners to invest in cross-cutting health systems to prevent child and maternal deaths, combat infectious diseases, and control HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>Revitalizing Alliances and Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific</strong>: To strengthen and modernize America’s alliances and partnerships in a vital global region and affirm U.S. leadership in strategic competition, the Request includes $1.8 billion to implement the Indo-Pacific Strategy to support a free, open, connected, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific Region, and an additional $400 million for the Countering PRC Malign Influence Fund (CPMIF).</p>
<p><strong>Defending Democracy Globally</strong>: In response to increasing authoritarianism around the world, the Request has more than $3.2 billion to advance democratization, protect universal human rights, bolster anti-corruption work, and increase programming that builds inclusive, legitimate, and effective governance – consistent with the commitments made during the President’s Summit for Democracy.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting Gender Equity and Equality Worldwide</strong>: The Request includes $2.6 billion to advance gender equity and equality across a broad range of sectors, more than doubling such funding over the FY 2022 Budget. This entails $200 million for the Gender Equity and Equality Action (GEEA) Fund to advance the economic security of women and girls.</p>
<p><strong>Revitalizing and Expanding the Diplomatic and Development Workforce</strong>: This Request would equip the Department and USAID to continue to recruit, retain, and develop a diverse, dynamic, and highly capable workforce to tackle 21st century challenges. It advances diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility; supports professional development opportunities; and builds capacity in critical new areas such as cyberspace and emerging technology.</p>
<p>The Budget Request makes these smart investments while also reducing deficits and improving our country’s long-term fiscal outlook.</p>
<p>The State Department and USAID are also releasing today the new 2022-2026 Joint Strategic Plan (JSP), a four-year joint plan that serves as the primary State and USAID strategy for advancing our foreign policy and development priorities in both organizations. The JSP is organized around five goals, as reflected in the Request as well: renewing U.S. leadership and mobilizing coalitions to address the global challenges that have the greatest impact on Americans’ security and well-being; promoting global prosperity and shaping an international environment in which the United States can thrive; strengthening democratic institutions, upholding universal values, and promoting human dignity; revitalizing the diplomatic and development workforce and institutions, and serving U.S. citizens around the world and facilitating secure international travel.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the publication of the Joint Strategic Plan and in support of the <em>Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018, </em>the Department will release the 2022 Capacity Assessment for Research, Evaluation, Statistics and Other Analysis, and the Annual Evaluation Plan. The Department’s first enterprise–wide Learning Agenda will be released in April. Together these three documents will promote building evidence and learning in pursuit of the objectives detailed in the Joint Strategic Plan.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Ramallah, the West Bank </p>
<p>Muqata’a </p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT ABBAS: </strong>(Via interpreter)  In the name of God, the merciful, it gives me great pleasure to welcome U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in his visit to Palestine.  This was an opportunity for me to inform him of the recent developments here.  We also extended the thanks of the – to the administration for the support it provides to the Palestinian people, especially the UNRWA.</p>
<p>We would like to assert at the outset that the priority should always be towards finding a political solution that would end the Israeli occupation of the land of Palestine along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, and to resolve all permanent status issues, including the issues of the refugees and the release of all prisoners under the supervision and sponsorship of the Quartet and according to the – to international resolutions.</p>
<p>We would also like to stress that the state of Palestine abides by international law and all signed agreements, and is – also adheres to the path of peaceful popular resistance and working with the other countries and with the U.S. in – on combating terrorism in our region and the world.  On the other hand, we also stress the importance of the implementation of what the administration of President Biden believes in, which is its belief in a two-state solution and the putting an end to settlements and the violence of settlers, and maintaining the historical status in al-Aqsa Mosque and preventing unilateral actions inside, and also the reopening of the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, and the annulment of all American laws that consider the PLO a terrorist organization inciting violence.</p>
<p>The latest incidents in Europe have proven that there are double standards being flagrantly observed around the world.  For in spite of the crimes of the Israeli occupation that have reached a stage of ethnic cleansing and racial discrimination, as conceded by human rights organizations, and its continuous aggression against sanctities and a lack of respect for international law, we don’t find any party that would hold Israel accountable for its actions as it acts as a state above all law.  And the continuation of these Israeli unilateral actions will lead in the near future to a decision by the Palestinian central committee that would be implemented soon.  What is happening in Palestine is something that we cannot be silent about, and international law cannot be partitioned or divided.  And we here ask again, is it possible for the Israeli occupation authorities’ domination over the Palestinian people and the usurpation of its legitimate rights and dignity – can this continue without any other measures being taken in order to end this occupation?</p>
<p>So in conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Palestinian people for the success of the local elections that were held yesterday in an atmosphere of democracy.  And we had hoped that these elections were – could have happened also or taken place in Gaza Strip, but Hamas agreement with that, in spite of Hamas’s participation in elections in the West Bank.  We would like to express our sadness also for Israel’s prevention of the conduct of the presidential and legislative elections in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary, once again I welcome you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Mr. President, thank you.  Thank you for your hospitality and for the good exchange.  The United States is committed to rebuilding our relationship with the Palestinian Authority and with the Palestinian people.  We’ve been focused on concrete ways to help improve the lives of Palestinians.  That includes: rejoining UNRWA, half a billion dollars in humanitarian assistance since April of last year, and economic support to the Palestinian private sector, to small businesses, job training for young people, and support for food-insecure families in the West Bank and in Gaza.</p>
<p>But this support is more than simply economic.  We’re focused on advancing Palestinian civil and human rights, supporting civil society.  Indeed, I just met, as I think you know, with civil society leaders in East Jerusalem.  They are part of an incredibly rich mosaic that makes up the city.  With them, and here as well with the president and his team, we talked about the importance of responsive, responsible governance.  And at the heart of all of this is an ongoing, enduring commitment to the basic principle of the two-state solution.  Palestinians and Israelis alike deserve to live with equal measures of freedom, of opportunity, security, of dignity, and we believe that the most effective way, ultimately, to give expression to that basic principle is through two states.</p>
<p>Of course, the two sides are very far apart, so we’ll continue our work, step by step, to try to bring them closer.  We’ll work to prevent actions by either side that could raise tensions.  That includes settlement expansion, settler violence, home demolitions, evictions, payments to people convicted of terrorism, incitements to violence.  And today we also emphasized the imperative of having a peaceful Ramadan, Easter, Passover, all of which come together in a month’s time.</p>
<p>Mr. President, again I appreciate the opportunity to discuss all of this with you.  I’m grateful for your hospitality.  And we will continue to work together for the advancement of the lives and livelihoods of the Palestinian people.  We’re committed to that.</p>

<p>Ramallah, the West Bank </p>
<p>Muqata’a </p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT ABBAS: </strong>(Via interpreter)  In the name of God, the merciful, it gives me great pleasure to welcome U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in his visit to Palestine.  This was an opportunity for me to inform him of the recent developments here.  We also extended the thanks of the – to the administration for the support it provides to the Palestinian people, especially the UNRWA.</p>
<p>We would like to assert at the outset that the priority should always be towards finding a political solution that would end the Israeli occupation of the land of Palestine along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, and to resolve all permanent status issues, including the issues of the refugees and the release of all prisoners under the supervision and sponsorship of the Quartet and according to the – to international resolutions.</p>
<p>We would also like to stress that the state of Palestine abides by international law and all signed agreements, and is – also adheres to the path of peaceful popular resistance and working with the other countries and with the U.S. in – on combating terrorism in our region and the world.  On the other hand, we also stress the importance of the implementation of what the administration of President Biden believes in, which is its belief in a two-state solution and the putting an end to settlements and the violence of settlers, and maintaining the historical status in al-Aqsa Mosque and preventing unilateral actions inside, and also the reopening of the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, and the annulment of all American laws that consider the PLO a terrorist organization inciting violence.</p>
<p>The latest incidents in Europe have proven that there are double standards being flagrantly observed around the world.  For in spite of the crimes of the Israeli occupation that have reached a stage of ethnic cleansing and racial discrimination, as conceded by human rights organizations, and its continuous aggression against sanctities and a lack of respect for international law, we don’t find any party that would hold Israel accountable for its actions as it acts as a state above all law.  And the continuation of these Israeli unilateral actions will lead in the near future to a decision by the Palestinian central committee that would be implemented soon.  What is happening in Palestine is something that we cannot be silent about, and international law cannot be partitioned or divided.  And we here ask again, is it possible for the Israeli occupation authorities’ domination over the Palestinian people and the usurpation of its legitimate rights and dignity – can this continue without any other measures being taken in order to end this occupation?</p>
<p>So in conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Palestinian people for the success of the local elections that were held yesterday in an atmosphere of democracy.  And we had hoped that these elections were – could have happened also or taken place in Gaza Strip, but Hamas agreement with that, in spite of Hamas’s participation in elections in the West Bank.  We would like to express our sadness also for Israel’s prevention of the conduct of the presidential and legislative elections in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary, once again I welcome you.</p>

<p>Jerusalem</p>
<p>The David Citadel</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR NIDES:</strong>  Welcome, everybody.  Thank you all for coming.  This is a spectacular day.  Not only do I have my friend, a phenomenal Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, but this program is one of the highlights of this administration, which is the Nita Lowey Fund, which allows and has given and granted – Nita Lowey was a member of Congress who was a friend both of mine and the Secretary’s, and this was named after her – $250 million which will be going to partnerships.</p>
<p>But I want to just take a second to have Aler – are you there, Aler?</p>
<p><strong>MS GRUBBS:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR NIDES:</strong>  Who runs the USAID mission here in Israel and has done a spectacular job, to introduce the Secretary.  Aler.</p>
<p><strong>MS GRUBBS:</strong>  Good afternoon, and thank you to mark this event on the Nita Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act, which is also known as MEPPA.  And through MEPPA, this represents the United States commitment to supporting an eventual two-state solution and peaceful coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis.  The MEPPA will support building economic bridges between Palestinians and Israelis, as well as supporting people-to-people peace building.</p>
<p>On March 8th, the U.S. Government announced the first two grants under MEPPA, and it is a great honor to welcome the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken here today to make another announcement on MEPPA.  Please.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </strong>Thank you so much.  Well, Tom, thank you so much.  First of all, I just want to say how grateful we are to be working every single day with USAID because what I see around the world is extraordinary work that AID is doing, and no more so than with this project with the State Department because it is literally bringing people and bringing communities together to meet shared challenges and to discover in the process that, ultimately, they have a lot more in common than separates them.  And that is the power of the MEPPA program.  It’s the power of the work that we’re doing, and with the grants that are being awarded, including one that will go to dealing with a common challenge faced by Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs alike, and that is water scarcity.</p>
<p>So in this way and so many other ways, through practical cooperation, bringing people together, it builds habits of cooperation and breaks down barriers in ways that ultimately, I think, will help set the foundation for what we continue to believe is the necessary and important future of two states.</p>
<p>So it’s an honor to be here today.  It’s an honor to see this get off the ground.  And I wish you all very good luck in actually pursuing this project.  Congratulations, as well.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Jerusalem </p>
<p>Prime Minister’s Office</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:  </strong>Secretary of State, Tony, it’s a pleasure to have you here in Jerusalem, and, my friend, welcome.  We had a very meaningful meeting and I think we learned a lot one from another, and we were in sync.</p>
<p>Today is a historic day.  We’re hosting the Negev Summit here in Israel, where the foreign ministers of Egypt, the UAE, Morocco, Bahrain will gather together with Israel and the United States in Sde Boker, southern Israel, for this momentous occasion.  I’d like to convey my thanks to you, Secretary of State Blinken, and to Israel’s foreign minister, my friend Yair Lapid, for the important parts you’re playing in this summit.</p>
<p>The Middle East is changing, and it’s changing for the better.  We’re cultivating old ties and building new bridges.  We’re rejuvenating old peace and charging it with the new energy of the Abraham Accords.  We’re working together to overcome the old forces of darkness and build a new future that’s better, brighter, and promising.  And I want to thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your personal commitment to the Abraham Accords and for your continued efforts to grow, nurture, and further expand this important regional partnership.</p>
<p>Israel’s doors are as open as ever, as you’ve seen.  In a turbulent world, Israel is a force for peace, prosperity, stability, and for doing good.  That’s what we’re about: to be strong here and do good.  And unfortunately, there are other forces in the region that are still violent and destructive.  As I just shared with you in the meeting, we’re concerned about the intention to delist the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.  Their proxy, the Houthis, just this weekend carried out a horrific attack on Saudi Arabia.  I hope the United States will hear the concerned voices from the region, Israel’s and others’, on this very important issue.</p>
<p>On a different note, this week, the end of the week, the holy month of Ramadan will begin, and our government is working very hard to improve the lives of the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza.  Just earlier today, my cabinet approved 20,000 workers from Gaza to be able to work in Israel.  We’re going to be investing almost 40 million shekel in improving the crossings between Israel and Gaza Strip to allow smooth and a dignified movement between Gaza and Israel.  While we can’t solve everything, we can improve the lives of people on ground, and thanks to your help, this is happening; it’s materializing.  So even if you can’t solve everything, it doesn’t mean you don’t do anything.</p>
<p>As for the war in Ukraine, Israel stands firm with the people of Ukraine and is going to continue our effort to help reduce the suffering and end the bloodshed.  We’ve already sent our top medical teams to set up the most advanced field hospital inside Ukraine, on the western side.  I’ve been reported that they’re already taken care and treated over 500 patients.  At this moment, at this very moment, doctors and nurses are risking their lives to save lives of those in need.  I’m proud of what Israel is doing.</p>
<p>And of course, we’re doing what we can, when asked, to contribute to the efforts to end this war.  We do this while maintaining close coordination with the United States and with our European partners.</p>
<p>Tony, please, send my gratitude to President Biden for his friendship and for keeping his promise regarding the Iron Dome, which saves lives.  Israel greatly appreciates America’s commitment to our security.  The alliance between the United States and Israel is as strong as ever, and though we may have our differences, as friends do, it remains unbreakable.  Thank you and have a productive visit here in Israel.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you so much for this really, more than good, very productive exchange between us, which I deeply appreciate; so does my whole team.  We covered a lot of ground in our discussion, and I want to highlight, if I can, a couple of the issues.</p>
<p>But first, a point of personal privilege.  It is particularly great to have our new ambassador here, Tom Nides.  He’s a close friend of mine, a longtime colleague, but more important than that, he’s a good friend of President Biden and is deeply committed to the relationship between Israel and the United States.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Yeah, he’s okay.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, now, I will say – I’ve said this to Tom – I think we got the better &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We got the better end of the bargain because we have Mike Herzog.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Right.  There you go.  Wonderful ambassadors.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  You mentioned this, Prime Minister.  Last August, when the prime minister visited the White House, President Biden made clear America and our administration’s ironclad commitment to Israel’s security.  It’s something we say, but it’s also something that we do and that I reaffirmed today.</p>
<p>President Biden, in that meeting, promised his full support for replenishing Israel’s Iron Dome, and he delivered on that pledge, signing a funding bill that includes $1 billion for this crucial defense system just some days ago.</p>
<p>We also share and we are united in addressing the challenges posed by Iran, including its nuclear program.  And there is no daylight between us on the fundamental proposition that Iran must never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.  And whether there is a return to the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear agreement, or not, that principle will not change nor will our commitment to it.</p>
<p>I had a chance to update the prime minister on the ongoing diplomatic efforts around the JCPOA, as we’ve done consistently with our Israeli partners, and as we’ll continue to do.  And deal or no deal, we will continue to work together and with other partners  to counter Iran’s destabilizing behavior in the region, as indeed we’ve seen most recently in the Houthi attacks against civilian infrastructure in the United Arab Emirates and in Saudi Arabia – acts of terrorism enabled by Iran.</p>
<p>I thanked the prime minister for his diplomatic efforts, important diplomatic efforts, to end the Russian Government’s aggression against Ukraine.  We value these efforts and we’ve been closely coordinated throughout.  It’s important, and your insights as well are very meaningful, so I thank you for that.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We appreciate all efforts by allies and partners to stop the catastrophic suffering that Russia’s aggression is causing for the people in Ukraine.  And I have to say, we’re also grateful for the Israeli Government’s efforts to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine – including more than 100 tons of food, medicine, generators, other vital supplies, and the field hospital.  I had a chance earlier today when I was with Foreign Minister Lapid to actually connect directly with those who are running the field hospital.  We did it virtually, and it was very powerful to see that in action.</p>
<p>This support is crucial as more and more Ukrainian men, women, and children are being killed, maimed, displaced by Moscow’s attacks; more are trapped in barbaric sieges, where they are denied food, water, medicine; and where people are starving.  Fully half the children in Ukraine have been displaced by Russia’s aggression.  Half the children in the country.</p>
<p>I also made clear the conviction that the United States has that Israelis and Palestinians deserve to enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, and dignity.  And that’s one of the principal reasons we support a negotiated two-state solution.</p>
<p>The prime minister and his government have made important efforts to address some of the challenges facing Palestinians, increasing Israeli water sales to Gaza, granting permits now to 20,000 people from Gaza to work in Israel, legalizing the status of thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank.  And we very much hope to see more efforts along these lines in the near term.</p>
<p>We’re also encouraged to see members of the prime minister’s cabinet meeting with Palestinian leaders – including Defense Minister Ganz, whom I’ll see in a short while.</p>
<p>Our administration is also rebuilding America’s relationship with the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people, something I’ll continue to do today in Ramallah with President Abbas, and in East Jerusalem with leaders of that community’s vibrant and diverse civil society.  We’re increasing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people, totaling half a billion dollars since April 2021.</p>
<p>Today, we also discussed ways to foster a peaceful Passover, Ramadan, and Easter across Israel, and Gaza and the West Bank, particularly in Jerusalem, a city of such profound importance to Jews, to Christians, to Muslims.</p>
<p>And that means working to prevent actions on all sides that could raise tensions, including settlement expansion, settler violence, incitement to violence, demolitions, payments to individuals convicted of terrorism, evictions of families from homes they’ve lived in for decades – it’s a message that I’ll be underscoring in all of my meetings on this trip.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are increasing our efforts to foster partnerships between Palestinian and Israeli grassroots organizations, businesses, young people, other parts of society, through a five-year, $250 million Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act.</p>
<p>Right after this, in fact, I will have a chance to meet with one of the program’s first grantees – a project that brings together groups in Gaza, the West Bank, and Israel to tackle the interconnected problem of water scarcity.  Efforts like this will not only improve people’s lives, but build relationships that can help defuse tension and violence, and ultimately, lay a foundation for dialogue and for peace.</p>
<p>Finally, as the prime minister said, we discussed how we can continue to build on the significant progress of the Abraham Accords and normalization – including in the summit starting this evening, the Negev.  The United States will continue not only to support and to work with those who already normalized relations, but also to urge more governments to take this important step – to the benefit of people in their countries and far beyond.</p>
<p>Mr. Prime Minister, your recent trilateral summit with President al-Sisi and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed as well as President Herzog’s visit to Turkey for meetings with President Erdogan and others – these are just the latest demonstrations of broader engagement that is made possible as normalization becomes the new normal throughout the region.  And again, I applaud Israel’s leadership, its engagement, its diplomacy in building these agreements and making them real.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for hosting us today – and again, for such a constructive, important exchange on everything we’ve just talked about and more.  And thank you for continuing to strengthen what is an enduring and powerful friendship between Israel and the United States.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Thank you.</p>

<p>But first, a point of personal privilege.  It is particularly great to have our new ambassador here, Tom Nides.  He’s a close friend of mine, a longtime colleague, but more important than that, he’s a good friend of President Biden and is deeply committed to the relationship between Israel and the United States.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Yeah, he’s okay.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, now, I will say – I’ve said this to Tom – I think we got the better &#8212;</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  (Inaudible.)</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We got the better end of the bargain because we have Mike Herzog.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Right.  There you go.  Wonderful ambassadors.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  You mentioned this, Prime Minister.  Last August, when the prime minister visited the White House, President Biden made clear America and our administration’s ironclad commitment to Israel’s security.  It’s something we say, but it’s also something that we do and that I reaffirmed today.</p>
<p>President Biden, in that meeting, promised his full support for replenishing Israel’s Iron Dome, and he delivered on that pledge, signing a funding bill that includes $1 billion for this crucial defense system just some days ago.</p>
<p>We also share and we are united in addressing the challenges posed by Iran, including its nuclear program.  And there is no daylight between us on the fundamental proposition that Iran must never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.  And whether there is a return to the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear agreement, or not, that principle will not change nor will our commitment to it.</p>
<p>I had a chance to update the prime minister on the ongoing diplomatic efforts around the JCPOA, as we’ve done consistently with our Israeli partners, and as we’ll continue to do.  And deal or no deal, we will continue to work together and with other partners  to counter Iran’s destabilizing behavior in the region, as indeed we’ve seen most recently in the Houthi attacks against civilian infrastructure in the United Arab Emirates and in Saudi Arabia – acts of terrorism enabled by Iran.</p>
<p>I thanked the prime minister for his diplomatic efforts, important diplomatic efforts, to end the Russian Government’s aggression against Ukraine.  We value these efforts and we’ve been closely coordinated throughout.  It’s important, and your insights as well are very meaningful, so I thank you for that.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  We appreciate all efforts by allies and partners to stop the catastrophic suffering that Russia’s aggression is causing for the people in Ukraine.  And I have to say, we’re also grateful for the Israeli Government’s efforts to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine – including more than 100 tons of food, medicine, generators, other vital supplies, and the field hospital.  I had a chance earlier today when I was with Foreign Minister Lapid to actually connect directly with those who are running the field hospital.  We did it virtually, and it was very powerful to see that in action.</p>
<p>This support is crucial as more and more Ukrainian men, women, and children are being killed, maimed, displaced by Moscow’s attacks; more are trapped in barbaric sieges, where they are denied food, water, medicine; and where people are starving.  Fully half the children in Ukraine have been displaced by Russia’s aggression.  Half the children in the country.</p>
<p>I also made clear the conviction that the United States has that Israelis and Palestinians deserve to enjoy equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, and dignity.  And that’s one of the principal reasons we support a negotiated two-state solution.</p>
<p>The prime minister and his government have made important efforts to address some of the challenges facing Palestinians, increasing Israeli water sales to Gaza, granting permits now to 20,000 people from Gaza to work in Israel, legalizing the status of thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank.  And we very much hope to see more efforts along these lines in the near term.</p>
<p>We’re also encouraged to see members of the prime minister’s cabinet meeting with Palestinian leaders – including Defense Minister Ganz, whom I’ll see in a short while.</p>
<p>Our administration is also rebuilding America’s relationship with the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people, something I’ll continue to do today in Ramallah with President Abbas, and in East Jerusalem with leaders of that community’s vibrant and diverse civil society.  We’re increasing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people, totaling half a billion dollars since April 2021.</p>
<p>Today, we also discussed ways to foster a peaceful Passover, Ramadan, and Easter across Israel, and Gaza and the West Bank, particularly in Jerusalem, a city of such profound importance to Jews, to Christians, to Muslims.</p>
<p>And that means working to prevent actions on all sides that could raise tensions, including settlement expansion, settler violence, incitement to violence, demolitions, payments to individuals convicted of terrorism, evictions of families from homes they’ve lived in for decades – it’s a message that I’ll be underscoring in all of my meetings on this trip.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are increasing our efforts to foster partnerships between Palestinian and Israeli grassroots organizations, businesses, young people, other parts of society, through a five-year, $250 million Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act.</p>
<p>Right after this, in fact, I will have a chance to meet with one of the program’s first grantees – a project that brings together groups in Gaza, the West Bank, and Israel to tackle the interconnected problem of water scarcity.  Efforts like this will not only improve people’s lives, but build relationships that can help defuse tension and violence, and ultimately, lay a foundation for dialogue and for peace.</p>
<p>Finally, as the prime minister said, we discussed how we can continue to build on the significant progress of the Abraham Accords and normalization – including in the summit starting this evening, the Negev.  The United States will continue not only to support and to work with those who already normalized relations, but also to urge more governments to take this important step – to the benefit of people in their countries and far beyond.</p>
<p>Mr. Prime Minister, your recent trilateral summit with President al-Sisi and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed as well as President Herzog’s visit to Turkey for meetings with President Erdogan and others – these are just the latest demonstrations of broader engagement that is made possible as normalization becomes the new normal throughout the region.  And again, I applaud Israel’s leadership, its engagement, its diplomacy in building these agreements and making them real.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for hosting us today – and again, for such a constructive, important exchange on everything we’ve just talked about and more.  And thank you for continuing to strengthen what is an enduring and powerful friendship between Israel and the United States.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER BENNETT:</strong>  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Israel Presidency</strong></p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT HERZOG:  </strong>So <i>shalom</i>, welcome, Secretary of State Antony, Tony, Blinken, a good friend, a long-time friend, and a great friend of the State of Israel.  Your visit means a lot to us, and we welcome you whole-heartedly here in Jerusalem.  And we congratulate you for joining this wonderful summit which will take place today, the Negev Summit, which will include foreign ministers from regional states that are so important to this unified front, which has been built in the region, which is based on the Abraham Accords, and which moves forward in peace and mutual cooperation and respect.</p>
<p>I want to commend Foreign Minister Yair Lapid for convening this summit, and wish him success in this very important gathering.  We will work together to find further regional cooperations, and for the benefit of all peoples in the region, and the benefit of peace, and, of course, preventing any threats against Israel, as well as my own personal commitment to move forward and try to help in all relevant cooperations and activities that are pushing forward together with our friends and allies in this region.</p>
<p>I will conclude by saying, Foreign Minister, that – Foreign Secretary, that we all welcome you here not only because you are a friend, but also because the United States is Israel’s most important ally and closest friend in the world.  And we see you as friends and part of the family.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Thank you so much, Mr. President.  It’s wonderful to be with you, it’s wonderful to be in Israel, it’s wonderful to be here in this very special place.  And it’s also an honor.</p>
<p>To your point, this evening, when we head to the Negev, what is happening there is something that I think would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.  And what we’re seeing is normalization become the new normal for this region.  And I think it’s going to attract more and more countries, as they see the benefits of these partnerships among so many of the leading countries in – from the region.</p>
<p>The United States is very proud to be a part of that, to support the efforts to deepen the partnerships with countries that have already normalized with Israel, and to help seek new partners, and to make sure that, as we’re working together, we’re doing it in a way that, of course, stands up for our common security – because we face common challenges – but also finds ways to make meaningful difference in the lives of our citizens.</p>
<p>And that’s the tremendous opportunity of what is coming together in the Negev later today:  the opportunity to work together, invest together in infrastructure, in global health, in dealing with climate change, renewable energy, bringing our businesses together, bringing our people together.  It’s an incredibly powerful and positive vision for the future, and Israel is making that real, and I applaud that.</p>
<p>And I also have to say, Mr. President, how much we applaud the leadership of this government, including, for example, on trying to bring an end to Russia’s horrific aggression against Ukraine.  Prime Minister Bennett has made important efforts to see if there’s a diplomatic path forward.  We applaud them.  We applaud the support that you’re providing, including the humanitarian hospital, a field hospital in Israel that is set up that is able to see directly, by a video link with –</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT HERZOG:</strong>  Yes, I spoke to them on Friday night, (inaudible) congratulated them all.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  It’s a wonderful thing.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT HERZOG:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  And, of course, there is much to discuss about the relationship to Palestinians, and our support for them, and the work that’s being done to try to improve their lives, as well.</p>
<p>So lots to talk about.  But for me it’s always especially wonderful and meaningful to be in Israel.  The United States has a deep attachment to this country, to this relationship, to this partnership, to this alliance.  We have a sacrosanct commitment to Israel’s security.  President Biden reaffirmed that again recently with the provision of $1 billion for Iron Dome, something that has saved lives in the past and, if necessary, will do so in the future.</p>
<p>And I will just say simply, in concluding, it’s also very meaningful to me on a personal level, as well.  So thank you.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT HERZOG:</strong>  Thank you very much.  I – no, I will just say to all the visitors in the Negev Summit:  Secretary of State Tony Blinken, foreign ministers of the UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, and Egypt.  (In Hebrew.)  We welcome you all to the State of Israel.  (In Hebrew.)  Thank you.</p>
