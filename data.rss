					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Our partnership with the people of Ukraine is steadfast and enduring, and we are focused on Ukraine&#8217;s urgent humanitarian needs as an important part of our response to Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack.  It is with the welfare of ordinary Ukrainians in mind that we are announcing the provision of nearly $54 million in humanitarian assistance to those affected by Russia’s further invasion.  This funding includes nearly $26 million from the Department of State and $28 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development.</p>
<p>The United States is one of the largest humanitarian donors to Ukraine, and our humanitarian assistance now amounts to nearly $405 million to vulnerable communities since Russia invaded Ukraine eight years ago.  This latest tranche of humanitarian assistance will flow through independent humanitarian organizations that deliver needs-based assistance with impartiality, humanity, neutrality, and independence.</p>
<p>This additional assistance will enable international humanitarian organizations to further support the people of Ukraine, working closely with the Government of Ukraine and European allies and partners at the forefront of any response.  This includes the provision of food, safe drinking water, shelter, emergency health care, winterization, and protection. Our funding will also help humanitarian organizations maintain contact between family members who have been separated due to the conflict, hopefully leading to reunification in some cases.</p>
<p>The United States commends the hospitality of the neighboring countries in the region hosting fleeing Ukrainians, and we are engaging diplomatically to support their efforts to keep their borders open and assist those seeking international protection.  As with any refugee situation, we call on the international community to respond to the needs of those seeking protection in a way consistent with the principle of non-refoulement and our shared obligations under international law.  We welcome the contributions of other donors toward this crisis response and urge still others to generously support the immediate humanitarian needs in Ukraine and the region.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Ukraine is a sovereign, democratic, and peace-loving nation. The United States and Ukraine have been partners since Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union more than 30 years ago. After Russia invaded and partially occupied Ukraine in 2014, the United States intensified efforts to help Ukraine deter further Russian aggression, and, if needed, to defend itself from additional attacks. Last fall, as the present threat against Ukraine from Russia developed, under authority delegated by the President, I authorized the Department of Defense to provide $60 million in immediate military assistance to Ukraine. In December, as that threat materialized, I authorized a further drawdown worth $200 million. Today, as Ukraine fights with courage and pride against Russia’s brutal and unprovoked assault, I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation by the President, an unprecedented third Presidential Drawdown of up to $350 million for immediate support to Ukraine’s defense. This brings the total security assistance the United States has committed to Ukraine over the past year to more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>This package will include further lethal defensive assistance to help Ukraine address the armored, airborne, and other threats it is now facing. It is another clear signal that the United States stands with the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereign, courageous, and proud nation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Joining us now is Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good to be with you, Norah.  Thanks.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Well, there were a number of alarming developments today.  Do you believe that Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv could soon fall to Russian forces?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, it’s certainly under threat and it could well be under siege.  This is this opening salvo of a massive invasion, and we see this continuing and threatening Kyiv and threatening other major cities in Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And where is Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy, and how concerned are you about his safety right now?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  To the best of my knowledge, President Zelenskyy remains in Ukraine at his post.  And of course, we’re concerned for the safety of all of our friends in Ukraine, government officials and others.  And we’re doing everything we can to stand with them, to support them.  We’re there for them – not only us, countries throughout Europe and countries around the world.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And we learned today that Russia captured Chernobyl.  Ukraine’s foreign minister raised the specter of another nuclear disaster.  Is that something the U.S. Government is concerned about?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, they’re going after various utilities, power facilities.  Chernobyl is one of them.  Obviously, that causes heightened concern and scrutiny.  It’s something we’re looking very carefully at.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  When President Biden addressed the nation today, he said that Putin wants a new Soviet Union.  Is there intelligence to suggest that President Putin will advance beyond Ukraine?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  You don’t need intelligence to tell you that that’s exactly what President Putin wants.  He’s made clear that he’d like to reconstitute the Soviet empire.  Short of that, he’d like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc.  Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine’s borders, there’s something very powerful standing in his way.  That’s Article 5 of NATO – an attack on one is an attack on all.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  So on that point, I mean, while U.S. troops are not in Ukraine, they are close by.  So what’s being done to lower the risk of some accidental escalation with Russian forces?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, you always want to make sure that you don’t have miscalculations, accidents, and so one of the things we’re looking to do is to be in communication with Russia on a military basis to make very clear what it risks if it miscalculates.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I want to ask you about some of the troubling words from Vladimir Putin’s speech.  He warned of consequences never seen in history.  Was he threatening a nuclear attack?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, I can’t begin to get into his head and to say exactly what he means by that – by those kinds of words, that kind of bluster.  But again, we’ve been prepared for whatever course that he chooses to take.  We were prepared to engage diplomatically, if we could, to divert him from the aggression that he has pursued.  We were also equally prepared now that he’s committed that aggression.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Russia’s economy is fueled by gas, and the U.S. is a consumer.  So would the U.S. consider cutting off oil and gas purchases from Russia?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, what we’re doing, Norah, across the board is making sure that we inflict maximum pain on Russia for what President Putin has done while minimizing any of the pain to us.  We’re in full coordination with other countries, both consumers and producers alike, to minimize any impact that this may have on energy prices and on gasoline.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks, Norah.  Good to be with you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Joining us now is Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good to be with you, Norah.  Thanks.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Well, there were a number of alarming developments today.  Do you believe that Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv could soon fall to Russian forces?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, it’s certainly under threat and it could well be under siege.  This is this opening salvo of a massive invasion, and we see this continuing and threatening Kyiv and threatening other major cities in Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And where is Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy, and how concerned are you about his safety right now?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  To the best of my knowledge, President Zelenskyy remains in Ukraine at his post.  And of course, we’re concerned for the safety of all of our friends in Ukraine, government officials and others.  And we’re doing everything we can to stand with them, to support them.  We’re there for them – not only us, countries throughout Europe and countries around the world.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And we learned today that Russia captured Chernobyl.  Ukraine’s foreign minister raised the specter of another nuclear disaster.  Is that something the U.S. Government is concerned about?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, they’re going after various utilities, power facilities.  Chernobyl is one of them.  Obviously, that causes heightened concern and scrutiny.  It’s something we’re looking very carefully at.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  When President Biden addressed the nation today, he said that Putin wants a new Soviet Union.  Is there intelligence to suggest that President Putin will advance beyond Ukraine?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  You don’t need intelligence to tell you that that’s exactly what President Putin wants.  He’s made clear that he’d like to reconstitute the Soviet empire.  Short of that, he’d like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc.  Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine’s borders, there’s something very powerful standing in his way.  That’s Article 5 of NATO – an attack on one is an attack on all.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  So on that point, I mean, while U.S. troops are not in Ukraine, they are close by.  So what’s being done to lower the risk of some accidental escalation with Russian forces?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, you always want to make sure that you don’t have miscalculations, accidents, and so one of the things we’re looking to do is to be in communication with Russia on a military basis to make very clear what it risks if it miscalculates.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I want to ask you about some of the troubling words from Vladimir Putin’s speech.  He warned of consequences never seen in history.  Was he threatening a nuclear attack?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, I can’t begin to get into his head and to say exactly what he means by that – by those kinds of words, that kind of bluster.  But again, we’ve been prepared for whatever course that he chooses to take.  We were prepared to engage diplomatically, if we could, to divert him from the aggression that he has pursued.  We were also equally prepared now that he’s committed that aggression.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Russia’s economy is fueled by gas, and the U.S. is a consumer.  So would the U.S. consider cutting off oil and gas purchases from Russia?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, what we’re doing, Norah, across the board is making sure that we inflict maximum pain on Russia for what President Putin has done while minimizing any of the pain to us.  We’re in full coordination with other countries, both consumers and producers alike, to minimize any impact that this may have on energy prices and on gasoline.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks, Norah.  Good to be with you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And once again tonight I am joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Mr. Secretary, nothing the U.S. or Europeans have done has been able to stop any of this from happening.  Now the President has announced new and harsher sanctions.  What’s the goal at this point?  Do you believe Putin will suddenly turn around his tanks and head home because of harsher sanctions?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Lester, we’ve been warning about this for a long time.  We’ve been planning on this for a long time.  We’ve gotten allies and partners together for a long time.  And we’ve made it clear that, on the one hand, if President Putin decided to pursue the path of diplomacy and dialogue, we’re ready for that and prepared to engage on that; but equally, if he pursued the path of aggression – which, tragically, is exactly what he’s done – we’re prepared on that too.  And as a result, we have responded in a united way, swiftly, and with real consequence to impose very severe costs on Russia for the aggression it’s committing against Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  If Russia begins to feel cornered and maybe even desperate in all this, do you worry they could become more dangerous and perhaps directly threaten NATO countries?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, first, Lester, when it comes to threatening NATO countries, we have something very powerful called Article 5 – an attack on one is an attack on all.  Russia knows that, and that’s exactly why, among other things, one of our responses has been to shore up NATO’s defenses – to put more forces, to put more equipment on its eastern flank, the countries closest to Russia – to deter any aggression that Russia might be contemplating against NATO countries.</p>
<p>But in terms of doing other things, look, I think you just have to listen to President Putin’s own words.  This is something he was planning all along.  We made every possible effort to deter him, to dissuade him from taking this course.  But clearly, this has been something that he’s planned for a long time, and it’s much bigger than NATO.  This is all about trying to get Ukraine back into his orbit, to reconstitute, if he could, something approximating the Soviet empire, short of that re-exerting a sphere of influence to subjugate countries on his borders to his will.  That’s what’s going on.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  And very quickly, any signs that he is losing support at home?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Look, much, much too early to say.  We’ve seen protests.  We’ve seen at least reports of more than a thousand people being arrested for protesting against war, but much too soon to say.  As the impact of this is felt, as the consequences of what President Putin has done is felt, including in Russia, that will have an impact.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Secretary Blinken, always good to talk to you.  Thank you for joining us.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks.  Thanks for having me.</p>
