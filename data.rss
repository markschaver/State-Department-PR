					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Chisinau, Moldova</p>
<p>Novitas</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR LOGSDON:</strong>  All right.  So, Secretary Blinken, welcome back to Chisinau.  We’re glad to have you here.  You all know the Secretary has had multiple positions at the Department of State, and we’re glad to have him back this time at the helm of the Department of State.  It’s very great.</p>
<p>I’m here to introduce him to you, but I also want to introduce you to him.  This is an amazing team.  The last time a secretary of state visited us was 2013, so we’ve been waiting a while – no pressure – and it’s also one month from today that Michelle and I arrived.  So thanks for dropping in to celebrate our one-month anniversary.  I appreciate that.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>We have another VIP visitor here today, Carol Spahn, the acting director of the Peace Corps.  Very happy to have you.  (Applause.)  Peace Corps Moldova is one of the most successful Peace Corps programs I think in the world, and we’re eager to have the volunteers back, so no pressure, Carol.  (Laughter.)</p>
<p>February 18th, we celebrated 30 years of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Moldova and the United States.  It was an exciting time.  Obviously, we didn’t get a lot of time to celebrate it because of everything that’s been happening in the region, but it was a really important 30 years and we have another 30 years ahead.  It’s a historic moment, historic opportunity, and we’re really glad to have the Secretary here to celebrate it with us.</p>
<p>That said, I’d have to take a moment and talk about COVID.  This community has really dealt with a very difficult past two years, especially under Chargé Laura Hruby’s leadership.  Well, we’ve lost people, lost people in our community, and we know that.  It’s been really tough.  So we want to go forward, but we also know that it’s been a tough time.</p>
<p>One more important aspect of this community I want to highlight, Mr. Secretary, is what this community has done to be part of the community here in Moldova, in Chisinau, taking care of the literally hundreds of thousands now of refugees from Ukraine who’ve crossed the border into Moldova over the last week.  This community organized, they jumped up, they said what can we do to help.  They connected with a former Peace Corps volunteer and his local business partner at a restaurant here, and they started collecting.  They started collecting everything you need – blankets, sheets, baby goods, food.  It’s been amazing, and I have to take just a minute and highlight Hannah Gardi for the work she’s done as really our (inaudible).  (Applause.)  So Hannah, thank you for your leadership.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary, thank you again for coming back to Moldova.  All of us here in the room, on the screen, we appreciate what you’re doing, what you’ve done for us, and we look forward to welcoming you back again very soon.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  It is wonderful to see you all in this room.  So now I think I have a new way of saying this.  I used to say it’s great to meet mask to mask; now it’s great to meet at least face to mask, and we’re getting there.  By the way, back in Washington at Main State, following the rules of the District of Columbia, we’ve once again taken our masks off, and hopefully that will last.  The State Department is coming back piece by piece, bit by bit to where it needs to be – cafeteria reopening, various other important landmarks like the sort of Starbucks hopefully coming back online.</p>
<p>But I’m really here for a couple of reasons.  The main reason, and I’ll come to that, is simply to say thank you, thank you to each and every one of you for the remarkable service that you’re performing for our country and for this relationship between the United States and the Republic of Moldova.  Kent, it seems like a month ago – and it was – that we were sending you off, and things were a little bit different then, so I guess timing in life is everything.  You can decide whether the timing was good or something else, but in all seriousness, it is so great to have both of you here representing the country, leading this mission.  It’s making a huge difference at a time when that could not be more important.</p>
<p>And Laura, thank you so much for your extraordinary leadership here as well.  I’ll come back to that in a minute too, but this has been in so many ways a challenging time for missions around the world and certainly here as well.  And Carol, it’s great to be with you today.  I second what Kent said.  No pressure, but I definitely second that.</p>
<p>And to everyone here in the room, our family members and other colleagues who are there with us virtually, it is great to be back.  I was here I think almost exactly seven years ago, and some things have changed, other things haven’t.  It was particularly meaningful to me to see one of my favorite landmarks, the Malldova.  (Laughter.)  So whoever came up with that gets big points in my book.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, why are we here right now?  We’re here first and foremost because we are dealing with an egregious aggression by Russia against Ukraine, but an aggression that, of course, is having a horrific impact on the Ukrainian people – men, women, children – many of whom we saw just yesterday in Poland at the border, many of whom you’re seeing every single day here in Moldova, who’ve been forced to flee the violence; but also an impact on the very international order that we have worked so hard over so many decades to try to maintain, as imperfectly as we do it.</p>
<p>What Russia is doing, what Vladimir Putin is doing, is not only terrible violence to men, women, and children.  He’s doing terrible violence to the very principles that lie beneath that order and are working to keep peace and security around the world.  And, simply put, we can’t let either of those things go forward with impunity, because if we do, it opens a Pandora’s box that we will deeply, deeply regret not just in Europe but potentially around the world.</p>
<p>It’s basic principles that underlie the order, include the proposition that countries are entitled to sovereignty, to decide for themselves what their policies will be, with whom they’ll associate, to have their – the integrity of their borders respected, to basically allow their own people to decide their own future.  And all of that is on the line with this aggression.</p>
<p>But all of that equally applies here to the Republic of Moldova, and just as we’re standing strongly for Ukraine, for its territorial integrity, its independence, its sovereignty, so too do we stand with Moldova and any other country that may be threatened in the same way.  And that’s very much the message that I brought to the president, the prime minister, the foreign minister today.  It’s important that our friends here in Moldova understand that we and the world are with them too.</p>
<p>And I hope that at the very least one of the things that President Putin has seen in the unprecedented response to the aggression in Ukraine from virtually the entirety of the international community, starting with the United States and European allies and partners through NATO, the European Union, the OSCE, the G7, but also most of the international community – 141 countries at the United Nations standing up and saying we condemn this aggression and we stand with Ukraine – I hope that message is not lost on him, because it applies not just to Ukraine.  It would apply everywhere that we might face such aggression, including here.</p>
<p>What you’re doing every day, before this episode, now during it, and after it, is extraordinary because it’s supporting a relationship with an extraordinary country.  I have to tell you – and I suspect many of you feel the same way – it’s inspiring to see the work that our friends here are doing.  At a time in the world when over the last decade or 15 years we’ve seen in many places democratic backsliding, in country after country – we’ve had our own challenges – here in Moldova, we see a country with extraordinary leaders trying to move forward, to strengthen their democracy, to build it, and in so doing, of course, benefit the people of Moldova, but also set an example for the world.  So it’s a small country, but it is setting a very big example.</p>
<p>And you are a critical part of making that happen, because the work that you’re doing, the support you’re providing, the guidance you’re giving, all of that I think is essential to the success of this project.  And I just want to thank you for doing it.</p>
<p>I also know that under normal times, a visit by me or by someone from Washington puts a little extra burden on an embassy.  This is not an ordinary time.  I know people have been driving back and forth, three hours each way, to the border, including to help bring some of our folks back and forth.  Some of you will be doing that in just a short while.  At the same time, helping the refugees who are coming in, helping our Moldovan friends help them, and that support is extraordinary, and I really want to thank you as well because I know we’ve added to the burden.</p>
<p>And I know that some people in particular have been doing exceptional things.  Is Valeriu Cernea here?  Maybe on the screen?  I wanted to single out Valeriu and also Sam Ludwig – anywhere here today?  Thank you.  (Applause.)</p>
<p>We have alumni from our exchange programs who are helping refugees as we speak.  They are part of a community.  Even after the exchange programs, their participation ends, it carries on.  They’re out there doing it.  We have, I know, family members who are with us on the screen who, as Kent said, have been delivering blankets, food, baby clothes to refugee centers.  We have the lifeblood of this and any embassy, our locally employed staff, opening their homes to refugees from Ukraine.  All of that is extraordinary even as it may seem ordinary to you because it’s just what you do.</p>
<p>And then, as Kent said, I know that the last two years have been difficult – more than difficult – because of COVID, and you’ve experienced loss.  You’ve managed despite that to carry on with incredible resilience, looking out for each other, having each other’s backs, delivering hundreds of thousands of COVID vaccines here to our friends in Moldova, working with civil society and the new government on all of the work they’re doing to tackle corruption, leading efforts to support an independent media throughout Moldova, and again, doing that at a time of personal challenge as well as professional challenge.</p>
<p>And I took note of some of the things that people have been doing, and again, they may seem small, but they have a big impact: providing groceries, providing child care when someone got sick as a result of COVID, keeping in touch through WhatsApp, finding some ways even in the midst of this to have fun, virtual wine tastings – I’m not quite sure how that works.  (Laughter.)  Chili cookoffs; something that I’d appreciate learning, how to make (inaudible) workshops – all of these things make a huge difference, because it creates a sense of community, it creates a sense of camaraderie, it creates a sense of caring for each other, and especially in challenging times that makes all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>So let me conclude by saying this:  As the ambassador said, we are celebrating 30 years of diplomatic relations with Moldova last month.  And as I mentioned a moment ago, we have local staff who’ve been serving with us since 1993.  Think about that.  That’s pretty extraordinary.  And let me see if any of them are actually in the room with us today.</p>
<p>Nicolai Jomiru – here, or maybe on the screen?  I’m just going to read off a couple names I really want to acknowledge because of this extraordinary service.  Constantin Mutaf, anywhere with us today?  I’m going to – we’re going to applaud all of them.  Vlad Cojuhari?  Here?  No?  All right.  Eduard Pirlea.  Dorin Trestianu.  All right.  Finally we got one.  (Applause.)  Aurel Veiru.  Yes.  (Applause.)  Please accept those applause on behalf of your other colleagues as well.  (Laughter.)  I’m glad.  I was getting worried.</p>
<p>But seriously, I really can’t thank each of you and each of your other colleagues who’ve been with us so long – I can’t find the words to express how much that means.  We’re so grateful for this partnership, for this service.  It makes all the difference in the world.  And let me just say to everyone here, whether you are local staff or whether you’re family, whether you’re an FSO, a civil servant; whether you’re State, Defense, USAID, Peace Corps, thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Chisinau, Moldova</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  We go now to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who’s in Moldova this morning.  Mr. Secretary, good morning to you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good morning, Margaret.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Vladimir Putin has said that sanctions amount to a declaration of war.  They are impacting his economy, but they’re not stopping his military.  When will sanctions stop the fight?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Margaret, the impact of the sanctions is already devastating, which is presumably why he said what he said.  But at the same time, we continue to see President Putin doubling down and digging in on this aggression against Ukraine.  That’s continuing.  I think we have to be prepared, unfortunately, tragically, for this to go on for some time.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>NATO has said none of its 30 members are willing to set up a no-fly zone.  President Biden has been very clear he has no interest in that or combat troops.  But what more can the United States do here?  If, for instance, the Polish Government, a NATO member, wants to send fighter jets, does that get a green light from the U.S., or are you afraid that that will escalate tension?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  No, that gets a green light.  In fact, we’re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians.  What can we do?  How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they’re handing over to the Ukrainians?  We’re in very active discussions with them about that.</p>
<p>Look, I’ve been in Europe for the last couple of days working closely as always with our allies and partners at NATO, the European Union, the G7 countries, and all of us together are continuing to take steps to increase the pressure on Russia through additional sanctions, all of which are very actively under discussion and will be implemented in the coming days, as well as taking further steps to give the Ukrainians what they need to defend themselves against the Russian aggression.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  How do you convince Vladimir Putin that this isn’t ultimately about regime change?  How do you get him to back down?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>For us, it’s not about regime change.  That’s – the Russian people have to decide who they want to lead them.  And look, as I said, the challenge is this: Vladimir Putin continues to press this aggression.  That’s why I say I’m afraid this could go on for some time.  But it’s going to end, and it’s going to end with Ukraine prevailing, because even as Putin has the capacity because he can – the manpower, the equipment that he has that he can bring to bear, can continue to grind down these incredibly brave and resilient Ukrainians, winning a battle is not the same thing as winning a war.  Taking the city is not the same thing as capturing the hearts and minds of Ukrainians.</p>
<p>What they’ve demonstrated with extraordinary courage is that they will not be subjugated to Vladimir Putin’s will to – and be under Russia’s thumb.  So whether that takes another week, another month, another year to play out, it will.  And I know how this is going to end.  But the question is: Can we end it sooner rather than later with less suffering than to – going forward?</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  President Zelenskyy has repeatedly said that these may be his final days.  If Russia kills him, what will be the consequence?  And are you working on a contingency plan to support a Ukrainian government without him at the helm?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The leadership that President Zelenskyy has shown, the entire government has shown, is remarkable.  They’ve been the embodiment of this incredibly brave Ukrainian people.  I was just a day ago in Ukraine, at least about 15 feet into Ukraine with my friend and colleague, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.  The Ukrainians have plans in place that I’m not going to talk about or get into any details on to make sure that there is what we would call continuity of government one way or another.  And let me leave it at that.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I also want to ask you about another massive diplomatic undertaking, and this is the attempt to negotiate a deal to put a cap on Iran’s nuclear program.  Yesterday, Russia’s top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, said he wants you to personally give him a written guarantee of exemptions from sanctions in order to keep cooperation on the nuclear deal.  Are you giving him that?  Is the entire Iran deal at risk?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>The sanctions that are being put in place and that have been put in place on Russia have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal and the prospects of getting back into that agreement.  These things are totally different and are – just are not in any way linked together.  So I think that’s irrelevant.</p>
<p>It’s also in Russia’s interest irrespective of anything else for Iran not to be able to have a nuclear weapon or have the capacity to produce a weapon on very, very short order.  That interest remains, again, irrespective of where we are in our relationship with Russia as a result of its aggression in Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b> What are the prospects for that deal and also two other aspects here – the American hostages that are being held by Iran right now? And do you see the prospect for Iran agreeing to stop threatening people on U.S. soil like they did a journalist living in New York, like they have threatened your predecessor, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We’ve made real progress in recent weeks on getting back to reimplementation of the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, and I think we’re close.  But there are a couple of very challenging remaining issues, and nothing’s done until everything’s done.  And so unless we’re able to resolve a couple of outstanding issues, then we don’t get – we don’t get back to the deal.  But we’re working on it right now.  It is really coming down to whether we can resolve a couple of outstanding issues.  If we can, we’ll get back in the deal.  If we can’t, we won’t.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>On those specific issues of stopping threats against those on U.S. soil and on releasing hostages, are those two demands?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>We’re going to continue to do everything we possibly can to get detained Americans, arbitrarily detained Americans, home, whether it’s Iran or anywhere else.  And that’s something we’re working, again, every single day.</p>
<p>When it comes to threats that that Iran is making, when it comes to actions that it’s taken outside of the nuclear area, including activities in the region, in the Middle East, that are threatening to us, threatening to allies and partners – again, irrespective of whether we get back into the deal or not, we will stand and act against those every single day.  We were very clear when we were in the deal originally that nothing about the deal prevents us from taking action against Iran when it’s engaged in actions that threaten us, threaten our allies and partners.  That will very much continue.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION: </b> Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks, Margaret.  Good to be with you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Chisinau, Moldova</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  We go now to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who’s in Moldova this morning.  Mr. Secretary, good morning to you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good morning, Margaret.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Vladimir Putin has said that sanctions amount to a declaration of war.  They are impacting his economy, but they’re not stopping his military.  When will sanctions stop the fight?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Margaret, the impact of the sanctions is already devastating, which is presumably why he said what he said.  But at the same time, we continue to see President Putin doubling down and digging in on this aggression against Ukraine.  That’s continuing.  I think we have to be prepared, unfortunately, tragically, for this to go on for some time.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>NATO has said none of its 30 members are willing to set up a no-fly zone.  President Biden has been very clear he has no interest in that or combat troops.  But what more can the United States do here?  If, for instance, the Polish Government, a NATO member, wants to send fighter jets, does that get a green light from the U.S., or are you afraid that that will escalate tension?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  No, that gets a green light.  In fact, we’re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians.  What can we do?  How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they’re handing over to the Ukrainians?  We’re in very active discussions with them about that.</p>
<p>Look, I’ve been in Europe for the last couple of days working closely as always with our allies and partners at NATO, the European Union, the G7 countries, and all of us together are continuing to take steps to increase the pressure on Russia through additional sanctions, all of which are very actively under discussion and will be implemented in the coming days, as well as taking further steps to give the Ukrainians what they need to defend themselves against the Russian aggression.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  How do you convince Vladimir Putin that this isn’t ultimately about regime change?  How do you get him to back down?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>For us, it’s not about regime change.  That’s – the Russian people have to decide who they want to lead them.  And look, as I said, the challenge is this: Vladimir Putin continues to press this aggression.  That’s why I say I’m afraid this could go on for some time.  But it’s going to end, and it’s going to end with Ukraine prevailing, because even as Putin has the capacity because he can – the manpower, the equipment that he has that he can bring to bear, can continue to grind down these incredibly brave and resilient Ukrainians, winning a battle is not the same thing as winning a war.  Taking the city is not the same thing as capturing the hearts and minds of Ukrainians.</p>
<p>What they’ve demonstrated with extraordinary courage is that they will not be subjugated to Vladimir Putin’s will to – and be under Russia’s thumb.  So whether that takes another week, another month, another year to play out, it will.  And I know how this is going to end.  But the question is: Can we end it sooner rather than later with less suffering than to – going forward?</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  President Zelenskyy has repeatedly said that these may be his final days.  If Russia kills him, what will be the consequence?  And are you working on a contingency plan to support a Ukrainian government without him at the helm?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The leadership that President Zelenskyy has shown, the entire government has shown, is remarkable.  They’ve been the embodiment of this incredibly brave Ukrainian people.  I was just a day ago in Ukraine, at least about 15 feet into Ukraine with my friend and colleague, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.  The Ukrainians have plans in place that I’m not going to talk about or get into any details on to make sure that there is what we would call continuity of government one way or another.  And let me leave it at that.</p>

<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>On those specific issues of stopping threats against those on U.S. soil and on releasing hostages, are those two demands?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Chisinau, Moldova</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Joining me now from Moldova, the latest stop on his European trip, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.  Secretary Blinken, thanks for joining us.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks, Jake.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  So you say Russian strikes are hitting schools, hitting hospitals, targeting drinking water, targeting electricity grids.  I understand that the U.S. doesn’t want to hurt European economies, the U.S. doesn’t want to risk direct military confrontation, but it seems clear that the sanctions that have been implemented so far have not immediately stopped Putin’s advance, that the line that’s being drawn right now is not likely going to be enough to stop him.  So what do you say to the innocent Ukrainian civilians who are saying, “Why has the West not directly intervened to save them from the slaughter?”</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, first, Jake, I’m here in Europe working with NATO Allies, European Union partners, and others working on, among other things, increasing even more the extraordinary pressure that’s already been exerted on Russia with unprecedented actions and sanctions that are having a crippling effect on the Russian economy as well as additional steps that we can take to help our friends in Ukraine, including getting them even more assistance on top of the historic aid we’ve gotten them to date and that has been effective.</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin has, unfortunately, the capacity, with the sheer manpower that he has in Ukraine and the overmatch that he has, the ability to keep grinding things down against incredibly resilient and courageous Ukrainians.  And I think we have to be prepared for this to last for some time.  But just winning a battle is not winning the war.  Taking a city does not mean he’s taking the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people.  On the contrary, he is destined to lose.  The Ukrainian people have demonstrated that they will not allow themselves to be subjugated to Vladimir Putin or to Russia’s rule.  But it could take – it could take some time, and meanwhile the suffering is real.  It’s terrible.  I’ve met with people who are refugees from Ukraine who have been forced to flee, women and children who are in neighboring countries, the men remaining in Ukraine to fight.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Right.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  We’re doing everything that we can to bring this to an end as quickly as we can, but this still may go on for a while.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  So you point out accurately that the sanctions are unprecedented.  They are.  They’re stronger than they’ve ever been.  But the U.S. still has not moved as quickly as the EU has on sanctions against the Russian political elite.  I mean the Duma, the national security council, the cabinet, their families, the top 100 oligarchs.  The U.S. has not banned imports of Russian oil.  The U.S. has not rolled out trade sanctions.  We’re still working with the Russians on the Iran deal.  Why not do everything we can now?  Speaker Pelosi said she’s willing to cut off all imports of Russian oil.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  We’re adding to the sanctions virtually every day.  We’re doing it in coordination with Europeans.  When there’s a difference between us, if there’s a loophole on one side or the other, we’re closing it.  That’s part of the work that I was doing here.  And when it comes to oil, Russian oil, I was on the phone yesterday with the President and other members of the cabinet on exactly this subject, and we are now talking to our European partners and allies to look in a coordinated way at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil while making sure that there is still an appropriate supply of oil on world markets.  That’s a very active discussion as we speak.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  The U.S. has ruled out a no-fly zone for fears of getting into direct military conflict with Russia.  Zelenskyy said, quote, “Then give me the planes.”  Now, you’ve said you’re in active discussions about providing U.S. planes to Poland so that they can give planes that the Ukrainians are familiar with to Ukraine.  Are you going to do that?  And can you explain why the U.S. cannot give Ukraine the planes directly?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  So we are working with Poland as we speak to see if we can backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians.  We very much support them, providing MiGs, SUs, planes that Ukrainian can fly, to the Ukrainians.  But we also want to see if we can be helpful, as I said, in making sure that whatever they provide to the Ukrainians, something goes to them to make up for any gap in the security for Poland that might result.  We’re actively talking about that right now.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  The International Criminal Court is opening an investigation into Russian war crimes.  The U.S. Embassy said it’s a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant.  They’ve tweeted that out – the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.  But then the State Department told other embassies around the world to not retweet it, which is a confusing step.  Has the U.S. seen evidence that Russia is committing war crimes or not?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Jake, we’ve seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians, which would constitute a war crime.  We’ve seen very credible reports about the use of certain weapons.  And what we’re doing right now is documenting all of this, putting it all together, looking at it, and making sure that as people and the appropriate organizations and institutions investigate whether war crimes have been or are being committed, that we can support whatever they’re doing.  So right now we’re looking at these reports.  They’re very credible.  And we’re documenting everything.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Western intelligence suggests that China asked Russia to not invade Ukraine until after the Olympics.  You talked to the Chinese foreign minister yesterday.  You noted that, quote, “The world is watching to see which nations stand up for the basic principles of freedom, self-determination, and sovereignty,” unquote.  China’s not doing that, are they?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Jake, you’re right; I spent about an hour on the phone with my counterpart, the Chinese foreign minister, the other day.  And one of the things that I said to him, as I said actually before Russia committed this aggression against Ukraine, is that China speaks often about the sanctity of this principle of sovereignty, and here you have a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the council that came into existence with the responsibility of keeping peace and security around the world, respecting the sovereignty of states; you have one of its permanent members violating that very principle.</p>
<p>And so we would expect China, based on everything it’s said in the past, to stand up and make its voice heard.  Its voice is very important in this.  And 141 countries in the UN system came forward to condemn Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and to stand up for Ukraine.  So we are looking to China to make its voice heard.  That voice counts, and I hope that they’ll do that.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  More than 1.5 million refugees have already fled Ukraine.  Millions more are expected to do so.  The UN says it could be the largest refugee crisis in Europe this century.  And I know you visited with some of these refugees in Poland yesterday.  Is the U.S. willing to accept Ukrainian refugees, and if so how many?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Of course, we’ll look at that.  In fact, you’re right;  I was on the border.  There was a terrific CODEL from the House led by, I think, someone you’re going to have on shortly, Mike McCaul, and Greg Meeks, the – Mike the ranking member and Greg the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, a bipartisan delegation.  We all looked at this.  We met with many of the women and children who have been forced to flee Ukraine.  We’re committed – the United States is committed to doing anything we can, first of all, to support the countries that are bearing the immediate burden of taking in Ukrainians.  And then as appropriate, if people seek refugee status in the United States, of course, we will look at that and I’m sure act on that.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, thank you so much for your time.  Really appreciate it.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you, Jake.  Good to be with you.</p>

<p><b>AMBASSADOR LOGSDON:</b>  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  It’s great to have you here.  If it’s all right with you, I will go ahead and make a couple of opening remarks.<b></b></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Please.<b></b></p>
<p><b>AMBASSADOR LOGSDON:</b>  Introduce you to the experts so you know who we’re talking to, and then ask you to maybe say a word or two.<b></b></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Wonderful.<b></b></p>
<p><b>AMBASSADOR LOGSDON:</b>  And then I’ll have each of them say just a slight bit about what they’re interested in and what they’d like you to know.<b></b></p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Wonderful.  Thank you.<b></b></p>
<p><b>AMBASSADOR LOGSDON:</b>  Thanks.<b></b></p>
<p>So 30 years after independence, obviously, the Republic of Moldova is at a critical moment, its economy, its workforce, and the democratic aspirations of its people increasingly focused on closer integration with Europe.  As in many countries, civil society is a leader in advocating for the changes needed for Moldova to become a fully democratic and prosperous country, fully secure within its internationally recognized borders and with a government that’s accountable to all of its citizens.  On March 3rd, the Government of the Republic of Moldova submitted its formal request for EU accession, and as Moldova considers its next steps toward Europe while welcoming and protecting a large number of refugees from Ukraine, we wanted you to hear from some of those who are working on the front lines of Moldova’s thriving civil society sector.</p>
<p>First, we have Nadejda, Nadejda Hriptievschi, a leading advocate for democratic reforms and human rights, followed by Victor Parlicov.  He’s one of the country’s foremost energy policy experts.  Following we have Nadine Gogu, and she leads the Independent Journalism Center, which supports free media in Moldova.  Then we have Ludmila Nofit, and Ludmila’s with Moldova’s preeminent foreign policy think tank.  And finally, but not last, we have Vadim Pistrinciuc, and he’s an expert in strategic development and conflict settlement, former member of parliament.  So you’ve got quite a range of interests here.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Wonderful.  Well, Ambassador, thank you so much, and to each and every one of you, thank you for taking some time today.  I was eager to meet you, but mostly to hear from you, because the work that you’ve been doing day in, day out to build different aspects of Moldova’s democracy is so vital for Moldova, but it’s also, I think, a very important lesson for many parts of the world, because even as we’ve seen in recent years some democracies in different ways fall back, Moldova keeps moving forward.  And that’s in no small measure because of the kind of work that you’re doing. <b></b></p>
<p>And I know that that work’s taken on a different kind of intensity in recent days with the war in Ukraine and the aggression by Russia against Ukraine.  I know some of you have friends, colleagues, and others who are in Ukraine and at risk now, others who’ve come here, and Moldova’s hospitality and support has been absolutely remarkable.<b></b></p>
<p>But it also underscores something else that’s important, I think, which is that the very work you’re doing here to build Moldova’s democracy, to build civil society, to build nongovernmental organizations – that’s exactly the kind of work that, among other things, President Putin is trying to destroy in Ukraine, because the very success of democracy is a threat to President Putin and the direction he’s taken his own country, Russia.  And so it only amplifies how important the work you’re doing is not only for Moldova but as a powerful example for the world.<b></b></p>
<p>But I’m mostly anxious to just hear from you, hear about your experiences, hear about your challenges.  As the ambassador said, we know well Moldova’s European aspirations and the work necessary to continue to advance in that direction, the reforms that are so important across different aspects of Moldovan society, whether it’s rule of law, an independent judiciary, an independent media.  All the kinds of things that you’re working on I’m very anxious to hear about, so with that, let me stop talking and hear from you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Chisinau, Moldova</p>
<p>The Presidency</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>(Via interpreter)  Dear President Maia Sandu, dear Secretary of State of the United States of America Antony Blinken, we start off the briefing organized on the occasion – on the visit occasion of Mr. Antony Blinken, Secretary of State of the United States of America.  We offer the floor to Ms. President Maia Sandu.</p>
<p><b>PRESIDENT SANDU:  </b>(Via interpreter)  Dear Secretary of State, welcome to Chisinau.  On the 18th of February, just two weeks ago, we marked the 30th anniversary from the establishment of diplomatic relationship between the Republic of Moldova and the United States of America.</p>
<p>Over three decades, the United States supported our efforts to consolidate the society and the economy, to build up a democratic state where every single citizen can think freely and exist freely.  We are grateful for the whole assistance offered by the government and by the citizens of the United States of America over this period of time, which amounts to over 1.7 billion U.S. dollars in assistance which helped us out to get consolidated as a statehood.  We do appreciate the firm support of the United States for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova as well as for our European path.</p>
<p>I wish you visited our country in peaceful times in the context of the anniversary of our bilateral relationship.  We do have great plans for the transformation of Moldova: we initiated the reform of the justice system; we started eliminating the corruption from the public institutions; we started working in order to improve the business environment to attract investments into the economy of the country, to encourage the development of local communities, and to rethink the education system of our country in order to prepare Moldova to cope better with the challenges of the time.</p>
<p>We want to build a resilient, competitive, prosperous and innovative country – a country which does invest into its people and which is capable to channel energy and the creativity of its citizens in order to build a place where people really want to live.</p>
<p>The reality we woke up on the 24th of February, however, set our plans on hold.  We are now living a dark period of time – a dark period of time for the whole region where all efforts are being directed in order to strengthen the society around one single objective: peace in the region.  As far as you know, the war in Ukraine is unfolding exactly at the border with our country.  We firmly condemned the military aggression against Ukraine and we called to peace from the very first hour of the military actions.  We continue calling to dialogue as well as to the possibility to identify some peaceful solutions as the only way to seize cease those violent actions against Ukraine and its citizens.</p>
<p>As a neutral country – and this is a principle enshrined in our constitution – we decided to stretch a hand of help to the people which are directly affected by the plague of the war.  From the very first hours of the armed attack against Ukraine, Moldova received on its territory the citizens from the neighboring country which are trying to flee from the bombs.  Over 250,000 people crossed the border from Ukraine to the Republic of Moldova from the beginning of the war.  A big part of those people stay in our country so far.  The employees of the public services – border police, customs officers, (inaudible) medical doctors, social assistants, local authorities, diplomats, but also a lot of volunteers – mobilized their efforts in order to help out the refuges which are arriving from Ukraine.  Thousands of people from all the regions of the country joined this effort.</p>
<p>When entering the Republic of Moldova, the refugees immediately received some hot meal, transportation, and a shelter in a temporary placement center or even in the houses of our people.  Tens of thousands of families from the whole country housed people from Ukraine over those days.  It’s a significant effort for a country with a population which is below 3 million and with quite humble incomes.  But despite those high challenges which represent this increasing inflow of refugees from the neighboring country, we cannot turn our back to those people.  Majority of refugees are women, children, and elderly.  They cross our border being exhausted, desperate, after long hours of journey escaping from the war.  It is our moral duty to help them out, and we’ll continue fulfilling this mission to our best extent.</p>
<p>Dear Secretary of State, the Republic of Moldova does need assistance and immediate and significant contribution of the international community so that our people and our economy can cope with these challenges and the inflow of refugees.  We do need urgently assistance for the temporary accommodation of those people in order to offer them the most necessary items and also to be capable to redirect the inflow of refugees towards the European countries which have a high capacity to receive them.  Some states already expressed the availability to take up the refugees from Ukraine, also to accommodate them, in the upcoming period of time.  But only through joint efforts, consistent efforts, rapid efforts of all the partners we can help out Ukraine.</p>
<p>We do need rapid assistance and involvement of the international community first of all in order to cease the battles and to restore the peace.  I do hope that the tour that you are undertaking over those days in the countries of this region contributes, together with the visits of some other high-ranking officials, to the peace efforts of Ukraine.  This is what we all want.  This is what we all deserve, especially the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>Dear Secretary of State, Mr. Blinken, the Republic of Moldova and the United States have developed a very good relationship in those over 30 years of cooperation and friendship relationship.  I do appreciate the strategic partnership between our countries, and I do hope that we will see each other again in some better times when we will be able to discuss how to advance, how to move forwards on the subjects which are included on the bilateral agenda of our countries.  I do hope that your visit gives a new impetus to our partnership.  We want to continue the political dialogue, the security dialogue between our states; we want to develop projects which are directed towards the development of the energy resilience of our country; as well as to advance on the dialogue for justice and to collaborate in the field of the asset recovery.</p>
<p>The Moldo-American partnership will help us out to strengthen the resilience of the Republic of Moldova as well as to strengthen the capacity of our country to cope with the challenges of the time, while a stronger, more resilient Moldova can become a pole of stability and development in the region – a trustworthy partner as well as a stronghold of the free world.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Thank you, Ms. President.  Now we pass the floor to the Secretary of State, Mr. Antony Blinken.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  President Sandu, thank you so much for the very warm welcome to the Republic of Moldova.  It’s actually been almost seven years to the day since my last visit here, and it’s great to be back – although, as you said, I wish it was under somewhat different circumstances.  Thank you as well to the prime minister, to the foreign minister, all our colleagues who have received us so well today.  And I’m also particularly glad that our new Ambassador Kent Logsdon has arrived here in Chisinau I think just last month.  For us, having confirmed ambassadors in place is vital for our cooperation with countries around the world, and that’s especially important now.</p>
<p>In the 30 years since Moldova and the United States began diplomatic relations, we’ve never faced a moment as urgent and as challenging as the one that we face today.  Russia’s unprovoked, unwarranted war on Ukraine has kicked off a humanitarian crisis that is already having a vast effect across the region, including here in the Republic of Moldova.  As of today, as the president said, an estimated 240,000 people from Ukraine have crossed the border into Moldova, fleeing for their lives.  They’re mostly women and children.  Their number will grow.</p>
<p>As I told President Sandu, Moldova deserves the world’s gratitude for welcoming and protecting Ukrainians.  And as the prime minister, president, and foreign minister and I discussed today, the United States will do all that we can to help Moldova as it cares for people who have already been through so much.  Our administration has requested of Congress $2.75 billion in emergency assistance, humanitarian assistance, both to meet the needs of vulnerable people and communities inside Ukraine and also to help countries like Moldova supporting refugees and address the humanitarian crisis from outside Ukraine.  The international community also has a responsibility to help Moldova deal with the impacts of war.  We’ll drive that message in our engagement with international organizations and other countries around the world.</p>
<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  One hundred and forty-one countries at the United Nations stood up for those principles and against Russia’s assault on them.  The United States wants to make clear our strong support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including the Republic of Moldova.</p>
<p>Countries have a right to choose their own futures.  Moldova has chosen the path of democracy, a more inclusive economy, a closer relationship with the countries and institutions of Europe.  The United States supports Moldova in those efforts, grounded in our respect for the neutrality that’s enshrined in Moldova’s constitution.  Our partnership addresses the key challenges of our time, the things that we should be working on and focused on, which is exactly another reason why this war of choice is such a terrible thing – it takes us away from things that we need to be working on together.</p>
<p>But we’ll continue to do that.  The United States delivered hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 vaccines to Moldova and millions of dollars in pandemic-related assistance.  We will invest $18 million over the next years to help strengthen and diversify Moldova’s energy sector.  Greater energy security is vital for your sovereignty.  We support the OSCE-led 5+2 negotiations to find a comprehensive settlement to the Transnistrian conflict that upholds Moldova’s sovereignty and territorial integrity with a special status for Transnistria.  And we’ll seek every opportunity to deepen the ties between our countries – economic ties, educational ties, people-to-people ties, because we want our friendship with the people of Moldova to grow even stronger.</p>
<p>In the face of the global challenges that we face today, we’re all going to be much more successful when we work closely together as partners, especially among democratic partners.  We know that countries that respect human rights, uphold the rule of law, support inclusive and accountable governance for all their citizens, produce the best solutions to even the most difficult problems.  So we will support Moldova as you pursue your priorities: fighting corruption, driving democratic reform including increasing integrity and accountability in the public sector and the judiciary, and developing an independent media sector that can deliver reliable information and help fight disinformation.  As people around the world stand up to defend democratic values, Moldova is a powerful example of a democracy rising to the moment with vision and with determination.</p>
<p>This partnership between us is built on shared interests, it’s built on shared values.  We’re grateful to Moldova for 30 years of friendship.  We look forward to the next 30.  And on behalf of the American people, thank you again for your generosity toward the Ukrainian refugees at this urgent moment for democracy and for peace.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>(Via interpreter)  (Inaudible) the colleagues.  Now we’re going to take questions from the representatives of the Moldovan press and the United States media.  So we start off with the Moldovan media.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Via interpreter)  Radu Osipov, public TV Moldova.  I have a question for both Ms. Maia Sandu and Antony Blinken.  Figures prove that in the first 10 days of the war, Moldova received the biggest amount of refugees from Ukraine.  It’s again by comparison with the population of the Republic of Moldova.  It’s a huge effort for our country.  What can the international community do in order to directly help out those people and in order to cease the war in Ukraine?</p>
<p><b>PRESIDENT SANDU:  </b>(Via interpreter)  We will continue helping out all the people that have to flee from the war.  This is indeed a challenge, and this is exactly the reason why we have requested the international assistance in the shape of financial assistance that’s all to compensate all the expenditures that we suffer in order to be able to help out those people.  But secondly, we need some clear mechanisms to refer – to re-channel those refugees that would like to continue their journey to reach another country.  So those are two concrete requests that we have put forward, and obviously we also expect the expertise of the specialists that had been involved in managing this sort of situations earlier.  I mean, people that know how to deal with the refugees – so far, the Republic of Moldova had never faced such situations.</p>
<p>So those are the most important elements of assistance which we are expecting from the international community as well as from our partners.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Let me agree with what the president said.  There is a major effort underway involving countries around the world to support refugees arriving from the Ukraine, but first and foremost, the burden has been on neighboring countries like the Republic of Moldova, like Poland and others that are the immediate responders.  And what we’re seeing now is the international community join in to support these countries and to support the refugees.  And so you have the major international organizations, including the United Nations in particular, that’s bringing its expertise and resources to bear.</p>
<p>As I mentioned a moment ago, President Biden asked our Congress for emergency support to include very significant humanitarian support to help Ukraine deal with the humanitarian consequences of this war of aggression against Ukraine, both within Ukraine itself but also in the surrounding countries that are receiving refugees.</p>
<p>So we’re bringing our own technical expertise to bear, including here in the Republic of Moldova.  We’ll also be bringing resources to bear to help alleviate some of the burden that Moldova and other countries are carrying.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  (Via interpreter) Mihaela Ursu, TVR Moldova.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  A question to the Secretary of State.  Which way do you assess the submittal by the Republic of Moldova of the application to join European Union, and which way the United States of America can help us out in this process?  For example, could we expect maybe some support in order to strengthen our energy independence, which is vital, I think, in order to have independence – true independence in our country?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.  I of course can’t speak for the European Union, but I can say that we very much support Moldova’s European aspirations and welcome the work that’s being done in that direction.  This is the will of the Moldovan people, and we welcome the pursuit of closer ties and greater integration.  But ultimately, of course, that process is up to Moldova and the European Union and its member countries.</p>
<p>When it comes to energy independence, I think that’s absolutely vital.  That independence and energy security is actually critical to maintaining one’s sovereignty and independence, and that’s exactly why we are working to support Moldova in its efforts to build greater energy security and energy diversification.  We’re doing that with financial support to develop alternatives.  We’re doing it with expert support.  As it happens, our new ambassador, Ambassador Logsdon, is an expert in these very issues, and so we’ll be working very, very closely with Moldova as we have been already to help produce greater diversification, greater energy security in the coming years.  I think this is something vital to pursue for all countries, and we know also what can happen when any country is – it’s the case for many – overly reliant on others that prove in one way or another not to be reliable suppliers.</p>
<p>So this is very much a focus of what we’re doing together, and it’s something we’ll be pursuing very actively right now and in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  (In Moldovan.)</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  I’ll call on Lara – excuse me, Lara Jakes with <i>The New York Times</i>.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Good morning.  Hello, Madam President.  Thank you for having us.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken, given that the State Department has again urged Americans to leave Russia immediately, are you considering closing the U.S. Embassy in Moscow?  And regardless, what is the Biden administration doing about the detention of American basketball player Brittney Griner?  Was this a retaliatory move by the Russian Government and was the announcement of her arrest yesterday what prompted the new travel alert?</p>
<p>And then, finally:  How seriously is the U.S. considering selling additional F-16s to Poland so that Poland can give its MiGs to Ukraine?  And realistically, how quickly can this happen to help against the invasion?  Thanks.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Lara, thanks very much.  With regard to the individual you mentioned, there’s only so much I can say given the privacy considerations at this point.  Let me just say more generally, whenever an American is detained anywhere in the world, we of course stand ready to provide every possible assistance, and that includes in Russia, as you know, and we’ve talked about this for a long time when we talk about seeking the release of Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed for some time, both of whom are unjustly detained.  We have an embassy team that’s working on the cases of other Americans who are detained in Russia.  We’re doing everything we can to see to it that their rights are upheld and respected.</p>
<p>We’ve also advised Americans not to travel to Russia.  Similarly, we’re advising Americans in Russia to leave.  But from my perspective, in times like these it’s important that we maintain our diplomatic contacts, that we maintain the diplomatic support, particularly support that we can provide to Americans who may need it.  And so that’s what I’m focused on doing.</p>
<p>With regard to the planes, a couple of things.  First, just as a general proposition, over the past year we have provided more than a billion dollars in security assistance to Ukraine, more than in any single (inaudible) year.  We’re in very active conversations with Ukrainian officials, with the government, President Zelenskyy, Prime Minister Kuleba<a title="" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_781799449323251992__ftn1" name="m_781799449323251992__ftnref1"></a> whom I saw yesterday, and others, to get an up-to-the-minute assessment of their needs.  And as we get that assessment, we’re working on seeing what we and allies and partners can deliver.</p>
<p>We are looking actively now at the question of airplanes that Poland may provide to Ukraine and looking at how we might be able to backfill should Poland decided to use those – to supply those planes.  I can’t speak to a timeline, but I can just tell you we’re looking at it very, very actively.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Yeah, thank you very much.  Madam President, what do you see as the implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for Moldovan security?  And what concrete measures are you hoping to see from the U.S. in terms of support?  And additionally, if I may, have you seen any changes to the Russian troop levels in Transnistria?</p>
<p>And for Secretary Blinken, you’ve been very clear that the – about the U.S. commitment to NATO countries, but you’ve been equally clear that U.S. troops won’t fight to defend Ukraine.  In that context, what kind of assurances can the U.S. actually make to Moldova about its own security?</p>
<p><b>PRESIDENT SANDU:</b>  (Via interpreter)  Of course we do follow and we monitor the situation in Transnistria.  We do not have so far information or intelligence regarding some significant changes there.  However, this is a subject of high vulnerability.  I would like to remind you that on the territory of our country, we have troops of the Russian Federation which are deployed here illegally and this exists for decades.  Of course it’s a vulnerability.  We do not have information so far which would confirm the intention for those troops to be involved in some military actions in Ukraine.</p>
<p>However, in this region, of course, there is no possibility for us now to feel really safe or secure, especially when we watch what is going on, when we saw all those attacks and the war in Ukraine.  Obviously here, we think the Republic of Moldova, the authorities of the Republic of Moldova try to do their best in order to ensure the safety of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova.  Beyond this security aspect, there are multiple implications for us.  There are implications related to the economic field since the Republic of Moldova used to have some very close links, very close relationship with Ukraine, and now all the economic operators, all the companies, all the economic agents which used to be part of this relationship are being affected significantly currently.  Obviously it is very difficult now to reach out or to get some positive outcomes in attracting foreign investors currently, although we promised our citizens to bring investments to our country.  But in the current situation, of course, it is very typical, and as I mentioned earlier, this crisis of refugees places a high pressure over our economy.</p>
<p>Judging by the figures that we have available today, the number of refugees we chose to stay in the Republic of Moldova count for 3 percent of the number of the stable population, settled population.  You see just in 10 days such a significant figure, and obviously those figures will go up.  I want to repeat, it’s our moral duty to help out everyone who needs assistance, and we will help everyone who needs assistance.  However, we do need support from our partners in order to be capable to help out other people which will definitely continue arriving to our country.  And we do hope that this war is ceased as far – as soon as possible.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Peter, we strongly support Moldova’s territorial integrity, its sovereignty, as well as its constitutionally guaranteed neutrality.  You’ve seen the response that we’ve helped to mobilize around the world to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.  Whenever and wherever that aggression might appear, we will do the same thing.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  (Via interpreter)  Dear Ms. President, dear Secretary of State, dear colleagues, thank you so much.  The briefing is over.</p>

<p>The reality we woke up on the 24th of February, however, set our plans on hold.  We are now living a dark period of time – a dark period of time for the whole region where all efforts are being directed in order to strengthen the society around one single objective: peace in the region.  As far as you know, the war in Ukraine is unfolding exactly at the border with our country.  We firmly condemned the military aggression against Ukraine and we called to peace from the very first hour of the military actions.  We continue calling to dialogue as well as to the possibility to identify some peaceful solutions as the only way to seize cease those violent actions against Ukraine and its citizens.</p>
<p>As a neutral country – and this is a principle enshrined in our constitution – we decided to stretch a hand of help to the people which are directly affected by the plague of the war.  From the very first hours of the armed attack against Ukraine, Moldova received on its territory the citizens from the neighboring country which are trying to flee from the bombs.  Over 250,000 people crossed the border from Ukraine to the Republic of Moldova from the beginning of the war.  A big part of those people stay in our country so far.  The employees of the public services – border police, customs officers, (inaudible) medical doctors, social assistants, local authorities, diplomats, but also a lot of volunteers – mobilized their efforts in order to help out the refuges which are arriving from Ukraine.  Thousands of people from all the regions of the country joined this effort.</p>
<p>When entering the Republic of Moldova, the refugees immediately received some hot meal, transportation, and a shelter in a temporary placement center or even in the houses of our people.  Tens of thousands of families from the whole country housed people from Ukraine over those days.  It’s a significant effort for a country with a population which is below 3 million and with quite humble incomes.  But despite those high challenges which represent this increasing inflow of refugees from the neighboring country, we cannot turn our back to those people.  Majority of refugees are women, children, and elderly.  They cross our border being exhausted, desperate, after long hours of journey escaping from the war.  It is our moral duty to help them out, and we’ll continue fulfilling this mission to our best extent.</p>
<p>Dear Secretary of State, the Republic of Moldova does need assistance and immediate and significant contribution of the international community so that our people and our economy can cope with these challenges and the inflow of refugees.  We do need urgently assistance for the temporary accommodation of those people in order to offer them the most necessary items and also to be capable to redirect the inflow of refugees towards the European countries which have a high capacity to receive them.  Some states already expressed the availability to take up the refugees from Ukraine, also to accommodate them, in the upcoming period of time.  But only through joint efforts, consistent efforts, rapid efforts of all the partners we can help out Ukraine.</p>
<p>We do need rapid assistance and involvement of the international community first of all in order to cease the battles and to restore the peace.  I do hope that the tour that you are undertaking over those days in the countries of this region contributes, together with the visits of some other high-ranking officials, to the peace efforts of Ukraine.  This is what we all want.  This is what we all deserve, especially the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>Dear Secretary of State, Mr. Blinken, the Republic of Moldova and the United States have developed a very good relationship in those over 30 years of cooperation and friendship relationship.  I do appreciate the strategic partnership between our countries, and I do hope that we will see each other again in some better times when we will be able to discuss how to advance, how to move forwards on the subjects which are included on the bilateral agenda of our countries.  I do hope that your visit gives a new impetus to our partnership.  We want to continue the political dialogue, the security dialogue between our states; we want to develop projects which are directed towards the development of the energy resilience of our country; as well as to advance on the dialogue for justice and to collaborate in the field of the asset recovery.</p>
<p>The Moldo-American partnership will help us out to strengthen the resilience of the Republic of Moldova as well as to strengthen the capacity of our country to cope with the challenges of the time, while a stronger, more resilient Moldova can become a pole of stability and development in the region – a trustworthy partner as well as a stronghold of the free world.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  Thank you, Ms. President.  Now we pass the floor to the Secretary of State, Mr. Antony Blinken.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  President Sandu, thank you so much for the very warm welcome to the Republic of Moldova.  It’s actually been almost seven years to the day since my last visit here, and it’s great to be back – although, as you said, I wish it was under somewhat different circumstances.  Thank you as well to the prime minister, to the foreign minister, all our colleagues who have received us so well today.  And I’m also particularly glad that our new Ambassador Kent Logsdon has arrived here in Chisinau I think just last month.  For us, having confirmed ambassadors in place is vital for our cooperation with countries around the world, and that’s especially important now.</p>
<p>In the 30 years since Moldova and the United States began diplomatic relations, we’ve never faced a moment as urgent and as challenging as the one that we face today.  Russia’s unprovoked, unwarranted war on Ukraine has kicked off a humanitarian crisis that is already having a vast effect across the region, including here in the Republic of Moldova.  As of today, as the president said, an estimated 240,000 people from Ukraine have crossed the border into Moldova, fleeing for their lives.  They’re mostly women and children.  Their number will grow.</p>
<p>As I told President Sandu, Moldova deserves the world’s gratitude for welcoming and protecting Ukrainians.  And as the prime minister, president, and foreign minister and I discussed today, the United States will do all that we can to help Moldova as it cares for people who have already been through so much.  Our administration has requested of Congress $2.75 billion in emergency assistance, humanitarian assistance, both to meet the needs of vulnerable people and communities inside Ukraine and also to help countries like Moldova supporting refugees and address the humanitarian crisis from outside Ukraine.  The international community also has a responsibility to help Moldova deal with the impacts of war.  We’ll drive that message in our engagement with international organizations and other countries around the world.</p>
<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  One hundred and forty-one countries at the United Nations stood up for those principles and against Russia’s assault on them.  The United States wants to make clear our strong support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including the Republic of Moldova.</p>
<p>Countries have a right to choose their own futures.  Moldova has chosen the path of democracy, a more inclusive economy, a closer relationship with the countries and institutions of Europe.  The United States supports Moldova in those efforts, grounded in our respect for the neutrality that’s enshrined in Moldova’s constitution.  Our partnership addresses the key challenges of our time, the things that we should be working on and focused on, which is exactly another reason why this war of choice is such a terrible thing – it takes us away from things that we need to be working on together.</p>
<p>But we’ll continue to do that.  The United States delivered hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 vaccines to Moldova and millions of dollars in pandemic-related assistance.  We will invest $18 million over the next years to help strengthen and diversify Moldova’s energy sector.  Greater energy security is vital for your sovereignty.  We support the OSCE-led 5+2 negotiations to find a comprehensive settlement to the Transnistrian conflict that upholds Moldova’s sovereignty and territorial integrity with a special status for Transnistria.  And we’ll seek every opportunity to deepen the ties between our countries – economic ties, educational ties, people-to-people ties, because we want our friendship with the people of Moldova to grow even stronger.</p>
<p>In the face of the global challenges that we face today, we’re all going to be much more successful when we work closely together as partners, especially among democratic partners.  We know that countries that respect human rights, uphold the rule of law, support inclusive and accountable governance for all their citizens, produce the best solutions to even the most difficult problems.  So we will support Moldova as you pursue your priorities: fighting corruption, driving democratic reform including increasing integrity and accountability in the public sector and the judiciary, and developing an independent media sector that can deliver reliable information and help fight disinformation.  As people around the world stand up to defend democratic values, Moldova is a powerful example of a democracy rising to the moment with vision and with determination.</p>
<p>This partnership between us is built on shared interests, it’s built on shared values.  We’re grateful to Moldova for 30 years of friendship.  We look forward to the next 30.  And on behalf of the American people, thank you again for your generosity toward the Ukrainian refugees at this urgent moment for democracy and for peace.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:  </b>(Via interpreter)  (Inaudible) the colleagues.  Now we’re going to take questions from the representatives of the Moldovan press and the United States media.  So we start off with the Moldovan media.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>(Via interpreter)  Radu Osipov, public TV Moldova.  I have a question for both Ms. Maia Sandu and Antony Blinken.  Figures prove that in the first 10 days of the war, Moldova received the biggest amount of refugees from Ukraine.  It’s again by comparison with the population of the Republic of Moldova.  It’s a huge effort for our country.  What can the international community do in order to directly help out those people and in order to cease the war in Ukraine?</p>
<p><b>PRESIDENT SANDU:  </b>(Via interpreter)  We will continue helping out all the people that have to flee from the war.  This is indeed a challenge, and this is exactly the reason why we have requested the international assistance in the shape of financial assistance that’s all to compensate all the expenditures that we suffer in order to be able to help out those people.  But secondly, we need some clear mechanisms to refer – to re-channel those refugees that would like to continue their journey to reach another country.  So those are two concrete requests that we have put forward, and obviously we also expect the expertise of the specialists that had been involved in managing this sort of situations earlier.  I mean, people that know how to deal with the refugees – so far, the Republic of Moldova had never faced such situations.</p>
<p>So those are the most important elements of assistance which we are expecting from the international community as well as from our partners.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Let me agree with what the president said.  There is a major effort underway involving countries around the world to support refugees arriving from the Ukraine, but first and foremost, the burden has been on neighboring countries like the Republic of Moldova, like Poland and others that are the immediate responders.  And what we’re seeing now is the international community join in to support these countries and to support the refugees.  And so you have the major international organizations, including the United Nations in particular, that’s bringing its expertise and resources to bear.</p>
<p>As I mentioned a moment ago, President Biden asked our Congress for emergency support to include very significant humanitarian support to help Ukraine deal with the humanitarian consequences of this war of aggression against Ukraine, both within Ukraine itself but also in the surrounding countries that are receiving refugees.</p>
<p>So we’re bringing our own technical expertise to bear, including here in the Republic of Moldova.  We’ll also be bringing resources to bear to help alleviate some of the burden that Moldova and other countries are carrying.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  (Via interpreter) Mihaela Ursu, TVR Moldova.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  A question to the Secretary of State.  Which way do you assess the submittal by the Republic of Moldova of the application to join European Union, and which way the United States of America can help us out in this process?  For example, could we expect maybe some support in order to strengthen our energy independence, which is vital, I think, in order to have independence – true independence in our country?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thank you.  I of course can’t speak for the European Union, but I can say that we very much support Moldova’s European aspirations and welcome the work that’s being done in that direction.  This is the will of the Moldovan people, and we welcome the pursuit of closer ties and greater integration.  But ultimately, of course, that process is up to Moldova and the European Union and its member countries.</p>
<p>When it comes to energy independence, I think that’s absolutely vital.  That independence and energy security is actually critical to maintaining one’s sovereignty and independence, and that’s exactly why we are working to support Moldova in its efforts to build greater energy security and energy diversification.  We’re doing that with financial support to develop alternatives.  We’re doing it with expert support.  As it happens, our new ambassador, Ambassador Logsdon, is an expert in these very issues, and so we’ll be working very, very closely with Moldova as we have been already to help produce greater diversification, greater energy security in the coming years.  I think this is something vital to pursue for all countries, and we know also what can happen when any country is – it’s the case for many – overly reliant on others that prove in one way or another not to be reliable suppliers.</p>
<p>So this is very much a focus of what we’re doing together, and it’s something we’ll be pursuing very actively right now and in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  (In Moldovan.)</p>
<p><b>MR PRICE:</b>  I’ll call on Lara – excuse me, Lara Jakes with <i>The New York Times</i>.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Good morning.  Hello, Madam President.  Thank you for having us.</p>
<p>Secretary Blinken, given that the State Department has again urged Americans to leave Russia immediately, are you considering closing the U.S. Embassy in Moscow?  And regardless, what is the Biden administration doing about the detention of American basketball player Brittney Griner?  Was this a retaliatory move by the Russian Government and was the announcement of her arrest yesterday what prompted the new travel alert?</p>
<p>And then, finally:  How seriously is the U.S. considering selling additional F-16s to Poland so that Poland can give its MiGs to Ukraine?  And realistically, how quickly can this happen to help against the invasion?  Thanks.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Lara, thanks very much.  With regard to the individual you mentioned, there’s only so much I can say given the privacy considerations at this point.  Let me just say more generally, whenever an American is detained anywhere in the world, we of course stand ready to provide every possible assistance, and that includes in Russia, as you know, and we’ve talked about this for a long time when we talk about seeking the release of Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed for some time, both of whom are unjustly detained.  We have an embassy team that’s working on the cases of other Americans who are detained in Russia.  We’re doing everything we can to see to it that their rights are upheld and respected.</p>
<p>We’ve also advised Americans not to travel to Russia.  Similarly, we’re advising Americans in Russia to leave.  But from my perspective, in times like these it’s important that we maintain our diplomatic contacts, that we maintain the diplomatic support, particularly support that we can provide to Americans who may need it.  And so that’s what I’m focused on doing.</p>
<p>With regard to the planes, a couple of things.  First, just as a general proposition, over the past year we have provided more than a billion dollars in security assistance to Ukraine, more than in any single (inaudible) year.  We’re in very active conversations with Ukrainian officials, with the government, President Zelenskyy, Prime Minister Kuleba<a title="" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#m_781799449323251992__ftn1" name="m_781799449323251992__ftnref1"></a> whom I saw yesterday, and others, to get an up-to-the-minute assessment of their needs.  And as we get that assessment, we’re working on seeing what we and allies and partners can deliver.</p>
<p>We are looking actively now at the question of airplanes that Poland may provide to Ukraine and looking at how we might be able to backfill should Poland decided to use those – to supply those planes.  I can’t speak to a timeline, but I can just tell you we’re looking at it very, very actively.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Yeah, thank you very much.  Madam President, what do you see as the implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for Moldovan security?  And what concrete measures are you hoping to see from the U.S. in terms of support?  And additionally, if I may, have you seen any changes to the Russian troop levels in Transnistria?</p>
<p>And for Secretary Blinken, you’ve been very clear that the – about the U.S. commitment to NATO countries, but you’ve been equally clear that U.S. troops won’t fight to defend Ukraine.  In that context, what kind of assurances can the U.S. actually make to Moldova about its own security?</p>
<p><b>PRESIDENT SANDU:</b>  (Via interpreter)  Of course we do follow and we monitor the situation in Transnistria.  We do not have so far information or intelligence regarding some significant changes there.  However, this is a subject of high vulnerability.  I would like to remind you that on the territory of our country, we have troops of the Russian Federation which are deployed here illegally and this exists for decades.  Of course it’s a vulnerability.  We do not have information so far which would confirm the intention for those troops to be involved in some military actions in Ukraine.</p>
<p>However, in this region, of course, there is no possibility for us now to feel really safe or secure, especially when we watch what is going on, when we saw all those attacks and the war in Ukraine.  Obviously here, we think the Republic of Moldova, the authorities of the Republic of Moldova try to do their best in order to ensure the safety of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova.  Beyond this security aspect, there are multiple implications for us.  There are implications related to the economic field since the Republic of Moldova used to have some very close links, very close relationship with Ukraine, and now all the economic operators, all the companies, all the economic agents which used to be part of this relationship are being affected significantly currently.  Obviously it is very difficult now to reach out or to get some positive outcomes in attracting foreign investors currently, although we promised our citizens to bring investments to our country.  But in the current situation, of course, it is very typical, and as I mentioned earlier, this crisis of refugees places a high pressure over our economy.</p>
<p>Judging by the figures that we have available today, the number of refugees we chose to stay in the Republic of Moldova count for 3 percent of the number of the stable population, settled population.  You see just in 10 days such a significant figure, and obviously those figures will go up.  I want to repeat, it’s our moral duty to help out everyone who needs assistance, and we will help everyone who needs assistance.  However, we do need support from our partners in order to be capable to help out other people which will definitely continue arriving to our country.  And we do hope that this war is ceased as far – as soon as possible.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Peter, we strongly support Moldova’s territorial integrity, its sovereignty, as well as its constitutionally guaranteed neutrality.  You’ve seen the response that we’ve helped to mobilize around the world to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.  Whenever and wherever that aggression might appear, we will do the same thing.</p>
<p><b>MODERATOR:</b>  (Via interpreter)  Dear Ms. President, dear Secretary of State, dear colleagues, thank you so much.  The briefing is over.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Chisinau, Moldova</p>
<p>Government House</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER GAVRILITA:</b>  Dear Secretary of State Blinken, welcome to Chisinau.  I’m sure we would have all loved to have met under different circumstances and for your visit to have occurred on a more positive occasion.  Yet precisely because our region has been plunged into war, it is even of more importance that your visit comes as a sign of strong support not only for our effort to deal with the large influx of refugees and to help the people of Ukraine, but also to support our aspiration to be part of the free world.</p>
<p>We strongly condemn the act of war on Ukraine and fully support the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.  We stand united with the people of Ukraine and our call is for restoration of peace as soon as possible, first and foremost through diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>We are firmly committed to help those who are fleeing from Ukraine.  The government has put in place the most comprehensive humanitarian operation in the history of the Republic of Moldova.  As of this morning, we had more than 230,000 people who have crossed the border from Ukraine and 120,000 stayed in Moldova; 96,000 of them are Ukrainian citizens.  For a small country like Moldova, proportionately this is a very large number and managing such an influx has only been possible because of the extraordinary solidarity shown by every person, every company, every nongovernmental organization.  Everybody has come together to host, to provide shelter, to provide food, to provide assistance to those who are fleeing the war.</p>
<p>But we will need assistance to deal with this influx, and we need this quickly and through flexible instruments.  Unfortunately, this humanitarian crisis comes on top of the developmental challenges that Moldova already had, and it was dealing with global challenges like the pandemic and energy crisis and inflation.  So we were already in double-digit inflation.  This war will also not only cost us in terms of the humanitarian cost, but economically, trade with Ukraine has been a very important element of our economy and we see disruptions of transportation routes and we see a global impact economically of this war.</p>
<p>So we count on your quick and comprehensive support as we have always had, and we are very grateful for the support that the U.S. Government has provided for the development of Moldova and to ensure the well-being of its citizens.</p>
<p>And finally, I just want to mention that we’ve – while we are facing these unprecedented circumstances, we are firmly committed to our path for European integration.  We believe that this is an agenda to transform Moldova into a modern, prosperous European state based on the fundamental values of human rights and the rule of law.  And we are committed to steer towards membership in the European Union.  We have submitted our application on the 3rd of March.  And as we embark on this journey, we know that we can count on the friendship and the strong support with the United States.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Prime Minister, thank you very, very much.  And indeed, you can count on that support across the board.</p>
<p>Let me first say, as you noted so well, this terrible, unprovoked war of choice is having, of course, profound consequences for the Ukrainian people, who are suffering terribly as a result while showing extraordinary resilience, but it’s also having consequences beyond Ukraine’s borders, including here in Moldova.  We admire the generosity, the hospitality, the willingness to be such good friends to people who are in distress, and indeed, we want to do everything we can to help you deal with the burden that this is imposing.  But we’re grateful for it.</p>
<p>As you also noted, at a time when all of us have so many things that we need to do to make the lives of our citizens better – dealing with what’s left of COVID-19, advancing the economic recovery that touches everyone, meeting the challenge of climate change and transforming our economies to account for that, so many things that we need to do for our societies, for our people – the last thing anyone needed or anyone wanted was a war, especially one that was totally unnecessary, totally unprovoked and, I’m afraid, premeditated.  And so the consequences, as you point out, go beyond Ukraine.  They go beyond even Ukraine’s neighbors.  They are in fact global because this is having an impact on everything that we actually need to be doing and should be doing.  And like you, we want to see it brought to the swiftest possible conclusion.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, we’re prepared to do everything we can in support of the Ukrainian people, in support of Ukraine’s neighbors who are standing up for the Ukrainian people and helping those in distress, those fleeing, and, of course, continuing to put pressure on President Putin and his government to change course.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, though, we’re also very, very pleased to be working closely with you.  I am in effect back to Moldova because this is my second visit here.  I was here in 2016.  It’s wonderful to be back.  And it’s especially wonderful to be back because your story is such a powerful one and positive one at a time that we need powerful and positive stories.  It’s a story of democracy emerging and strengthening and taking root, and it’s something that I think is inspiring to the world because it’s coming at a moment when over some years, democracies have been moving backward, not forward.  You’re the example of the opposite.  You’re showing us and you’re showing the world how democracies can grow, strengthen, and we are and will be your partner in that.  So thank you for having us.</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER GAVRILITA:</b>  Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER GAVRILITA:</strong>  Dear Secretary of State Blinken, welcome to Chisinau.  I’m sure we would have all loved to have met under different circumstances and for your visit to have occurred on a more positive occasion.  Yet precisely because our region has been plunged into war, it is even of more importance that your visit comes as a sign of strong support not only for our effort to deal with the large influx of refugees and to help the people of Ukraine, but also to support our aspiration to be part of the free world.</p>
<p>We strongly condemn the act of war on Ukraine and fully support the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.  We stand united with the people of Ukraine and our call is for restoration of peace as soon as possible, first and foremost through diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>We are firmly committed to help those who are fleeing from Ukraine.  The government has put in place the most comprehensive humanitarian operation in the history of the Republic of Moldova.  As of this morning, we had more than 230,000 people who have crossed the border from Ukraine and 120,000 stayed in Moldova; 96,000 of them are Ukrainian citizens.  For a small country like Moldova, proportionately this is a very large number and managing such an influx has only been possible because of the extraordinary solidarity shown by every person, every company, every nongovernmental organization.  Everybody has come together to host, to provide shelter, to provide food, to provide assistance to those who are fleeing the war.</p>
<p>But we will need assistance to deal with this influx, and we need this quickly and through flexible instruments.  Unfortunately, this humanitarian crisis comes on top of the developmental challenges that Moldova already had, and it was dealing with global challenges like the pandemic and energy crisis and inflation.  So we were already in double-digit inflation.  This war will also not only cost us in terms of the humanitarian cost, but economically, trade with Ukraine has been a very important element of our economy and we see disruptions of transportation routes and we see a global impact economically of this war.</p>
<p>So we count on your quick and comprehensive support as we have always had, and we are very grateful for the support that the U.S. Government has provided for the development of Moldova and to ensure the well-being of its citizens.</p>
<p>And finally, I just want to mention that we’ve – while we are facing these unprecedented circumstances, we are firmly committed to our path for European integration.  We believe that this is an agenda to transform Moldova into a modern, prosperous European state based on the fundamental values of human rights and the rule of law.  And we are committed to steer towards membership in the European Union.  We have submitted our application on the 3rd of March.  And as we embark on this journey, we know that we can count on the friendship and the strong support with the United States.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Prime Minister, thank you very, very much.  And indeed, you can count on that support across the board.</p>
<p>Let me first say, as you noted so well, this terrible, unprovoked war of choice is having, of course, profound consequences for the Ukrainian people, who are suffering terribly as a result while showing extraordinary resilience, but it’s also having consequences beyond Ukraine’s borders, including here in Moldova.  We admire the generosity, the hospitality, the willingness to be such good friends to people who are in distress, and indeed, we want to do everything we can to help you deal with the burden that this is imposing.  But we’re grateful for it.</p>
<p>As you also noted, at a time when all of us have so many things that we need to do to make the lives of our citizens better – dealing with what’s left of COVID-19, advancing the economic recovery that touches everyone, meeting the challenge of climate change and transforming our economies to account for that, so many things that we need to do for our societies, for our people – the last thing anyone needed or anyone wanted was a war, especially one that was totally unnecessary, totally unprovoked and, I’m afraid, premeditated.  And so the consequences, as you point out, go beyond Ukraine.  They go beyond even Ukraine’s neighbors.  They are in fact global because this is having an impact on everything that we actually need to be doing and should be doing.  And like you, we want to see it brought to the swiftest possible conclusion.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, we’re prepared to do everything we can in support of the Ukrainian people, in support of Ukraine’s neighbors who are standing up for the Ukrainian people and helping those in distress, those fleeing, and, of course, continuing to put pressure on President Putin and his government to change course.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, though, we’re also very, very pleased to be working closely with you.  I am in effect back to Moldova because this is my second visit here.  I was here in 2016.  It’s wonderful to be back.  And it’s especially wonderful to be back because your story is such a powerful one and positive one at a time that we need powerful and positive stories.  It’s a story of democracy emerging and strengthening and taking root, and it’s something that I think is inspiring to the world because it’s coming at a moment when over some years, democracies have been moving backward, not forward.  You’re the example of the opposite.  You’re showing us and you’re showing the world how democracies can grow, strengthen, and we are and will be your partner in that.  So thank you for having us.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER GAVRILITA:</strong>  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Rzeszow, Poland</p>
<p>Hotel Bristol</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Mr. Secretary, we really appreciate your presence.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>It’s a great honor for us.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>It’s very good to be with you tonight.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Mr. Secretary, you are one of more than 10,000 American citizens now in Poland. A lot of them are in this region – we are in Rzeszow now – most of them are soldiers.  We really, really appreciate your presence here, you and American soldiers.  You’ve had a lot of many different meetings today, including our prime minister, minister of foreign affairs.  Can you tell us about the results of these meetings?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Well, first, let me say this:  I am overwhelmed by the generosity of Poland and the Polish people.  I visited the welcome center for Ukrainians and others who are coming out of Ukraine because of the horrific aggression being committed by Vladimir Putin and Russia.  And to see the hospitality, to see the generosity of our Polish friends is very, very moving in and of itself.  And I think it speaks to a larger solidarity that exists and that we’re seeing between the United States and Poland, but also so much of the international community, in support of Ukraine and in opposition to a war of choice being committed by Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>The strength of our own partnership, I think, has never been better, and that was very evident to me in the meetings that I had today with the prime minister, with my friend Zbigniew Rau – we’ve worked together very closely on a very regular basis.  And we’re united in this effort; that’s what’s so important.  That unity in support of Ukraine, in opposition to this aggression by Russia, is what will carry the day.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Half an hour ago, we’ve heard about your meeting with minister of foreign affairs of Ukraine, the Minister Kuleba.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Yes.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>As far as I understand, you were in Ukraine – correct me if I&#8217;m wrong – you crossed the border.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>That’s correct.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>And can you tell us more about this conversation?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>First, Dmytro Kuleba is a remarkable colleague, a remarkable friend.  And he, like President Zelenskyy and others in the government, have been the face of the Ukrainian people in confronting this aggression.  But we’re on the phone regularly.  He’s somewhere in Ukraine.  I couldn’t say were for security reasons.  But I thought it was important when we met – symbolically – to cross the border and to have us stand together in Ukraine, because we’re standing together for Ukraine.  And we work very closely, and for me, it’s making sure that I understand as best possible what our Ukrainian friends and partners need, what we can do to continue to support them as well as to put the pressure on Russia.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Sir, in 1940, Churchill delivered his famous speech in British Parliament:  We’ll fight “in the streets,” “in the fields,” “on the landing grounds” until America, “with all its power and might,” would come to rescue us.  I would never imagine that they will say these words, but we have a war just next to us.  Would you be ready again to come with all your power and might to defend your European allies &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Yes.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>&#8212; this time, including Poland in NATO?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Yes.  Yes, that’s the – it’s as simple as that. President Biden said this to the entire country.  He gave his State of the Union speech – this is the speech that a president gives where he talks to every American in their living rooms – just last week.  And what he said there – and he’s said repeatedly in recent weeks – is we will defend every inch of NATO territory.  That commitment, so-called Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, is sacrosanct for him and for the United States.  So no one should have any doubt about that, certainly not our allies and certainly not Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Putin expected NATO to withdraw its forces, to remove military installations from the territory of new members.  The result is the opposite, with more American troops.  But what may come in the future – would you be ready to send even more troops?</p>
<p>Well, we had already – before this aggression committed by Russia, we had about 5,000 American forces in Poland as part of the NATO mission.  It’s now double that.  We’ve sent another 5,000 from the 82nd Airborne Division who are here now.   And what’s so striking about what President Putin has done, over many years now, is he has precipitated everything he says he wants to prevent.  What’s happened in recent years as a result of Russian aggression starting back in 2014?  Ukraine, Ukrainian people have turned against Russia.  Whereas before 2014 there were favorable views in Ukraine of Russia, now 90 percent of the country honestly hate Russia and certainly hate Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>At the same time, the NATO Alliance has come together as strongly as I’ve ever seen it, and the very forces of NATO that – a defensive alliance that has no aggressive intent against Russia, is here for our common defense.  That alliance has grown stronger, and it’s stronger closer to Russia as a result of Putin’s aggression.  So everything he’s done has been to create what he says he doesn’t want to see happen.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Vladimir Putin said today that Western sanctions on Russia are akin to declaration of war, which is a big lie, because even if Russian Central Bank lost billions of dollars &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>That’s right.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>&#8212; or some oligarchs lost your yachts and villas, it’s not a war.  War is killing Ukrainian kids.  What’s your assumption, sir?  Are these sanctions getting us closer to stop Putin?  Are they working?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>The sanctions are having a very, very powerful impact.  And I think the impact is, is far greater than most people would have imagined a month ago or six weeks ago.  That’s because so many countries are taking part and doing it together, and it’s because the sanctions themselves – going after the major financial institutions in Russia, denying Russia the technology it needs to modernize its most important industries, going directly at the oligarchs and their families – all of this is already having a big, powerful demonstrative effect.  The ruble has gone through the floor.  The ability of Russia to use the reserves that it’s built up to support its currency, we’ve taken that away by going right at the Central Bank of Russia.  In their daily lives – and it’s deeply unfortunate that the Russian people are suffering as a consequence, but this is what Putin has brought to them.</p>
<p>I have a list five pages long from yesterday – it’s probably longer even today – of all of the companies and businesses that have left Russia in the last week, the most important brands in the world that people know and – in their daily lives.  So the Russian people are feeling this in their bank accounts, in the value of the ruble.  They’re feeling this in the business that’s gone away.  And elites are feeling it and their inability to travel.  We’re now in the business for the oligarchs of seizing their yachts, their sports cars, their apartments.  So this is having a big impact already, and it will have an even bigger impact over time as Russia is unable to make the investments it wants in its future.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Mr. Secretary, one last question.  Millions of people are hoping and praying that the war would be over tonight.  But even if that’s the case, we all feel that the world has changed deeply, probably for a very long time.  What’s your assessment?  How much the world has changed since – in 10 days since the beginning of the invasion?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>I think you’re right, the world has changed, but it’s very possible that it ultimately changes in a positive way.  Here’s what I mean by that.  In the last couple of decades, democracies in one way or another, including our own, have in some ways moved backwards, or they’ve been on their heels, not on their toes.  What we’ve seen now is the most powerful response to an autocracy – Russia, under Putin, saying: oh, we’re going to do whatever we want, and we know democracies won’t respond.  We have responded; we are responding.  We’re standing with Ukraine; we’re standing against this aggression.  And it’s too early to say, because we have to see how this comes out, but this could be a positive inflection point where the world’s democracies say: there’s a line; enough is enough; we will act; we will come together.</p>
<p>And when we come together, when we’re united as we are at NATO, as we are with the European Union, as we are at the – even at the United Nations, 141 countries coming together and saying we condemn this aggression, we stand for Ukraine – that could be a moment of positive change, but only if we sustain this, if we see this through, if we make sure that Ukraine prevails, which I’m convinced it will because the Ukrainian people will insist on it, and that Russia does not succeed in what it’s doing.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:  </b>Sir, thank you so much.  We really appreciate your time and thank you for this optimistic part – we all need it.  Thank you so much.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you.  Great to be with you.</p>
