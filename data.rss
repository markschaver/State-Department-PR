<p>Melbourne, Australia</p>
<p>Commonwealth Parliamentary Offices</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, (inaudible), so good – so good to see you.  (Inaudible), good to see you, and I’m so pleased to be able to spend this time with my friend the foreign minister.  We’ve spent a lot of time together in different parts of the world; I think Liverpool was probably the last time in person.  Is that right?</p>
<p>But we are strong, resolute partners across virtually every issue of concern to the American people, the Japanese people.  We’re both here, of course, for the Quad meetings, but also taking this opportunity to touch base, check signals on the multiplicity of challenges the United States and Japan are facing together, whether it’s here in the region or beyond.  So I’m really grateful for this opportunity.  We’ve got a fair bit of ground to cover before we catch up with our Quad partners, so very good to see you, my friend.</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER HAYASHI:</b>  Great, great.  And good to see you again.  (Inaudible.)  (Laughter).</p>
<p>So since the beginning of this year, we have, as you mentioned, already had a series of seamless high-level engagement.  (Inaudible) two telephone calls between us, and 2+2 (inaudible).  We had a very productive discussion on how we deepen our cooperation and elevate our alliance to new heights.  So I am confident that our alliance (inaudible).  So let’s keep a close communication and maintain the momentum going forward.</p>
<p>So again, thank you very much.  Thank you, my friend.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Melbourne, Australia</p>
<p>Park Hyatt Hotel</p>
<p><b>FOREIGN MINISTER PAYNE:</b>  Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Tony, it’s such a pleasure to be welcoming you here today.  Our COVID protocols (inaudible) those that are speaking can speak without their mask.  We will replace them once we’ve finished speaking.</p>
<p>It is a great pleasure to welcome you to Melbourne, but first of all let me acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we (inaudible) here this morning and pay my respects to the elders past, present, and emerging of the Wurundjeri people, and acknowledge their stewardship of this great land.</p>
<p>As I said, it’s a great pleasure to welcome you to Australia and also to Melbourne.  Only two of your predecessors have visited Melbourne before, as I understand it – Secretary Rice and Secretary Clinton.  So you follow in the footsteps of great women, and it is an absolute pleasure to have you here today.</p>
<p>A lot has changed not just in Melbourne since those secretaries both visited, of course.  And indeed, in 2022, I think we are facing challenges of a different scale than those which we have been dealing with over the preceding decades.  But as you have said and as you reiterated in some of your comments since your arrival, when allies and partners work together we are so much more efficient, we are so much more collaborative.  When we are committed to our shared values, there are no challenges we cannot and will not overcome.</p>
<p>Australia affirms that.  I affirm that and I look forward to discussing those matters with you today.  Our work together in the Indo-Pacific is growing exponentially, and it is very rewarding to see the engagement of so many of our partners in the region with us both, as well as COVID-19 recovery, which, of course, is a very significant priority.  We work to counter disinformation.  We are going to talk today, I am sure, about the threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine as well, outside our own region.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss our AUKUS partnership and the progress that we have made so far, and very much welcome the collaborative work the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia are doing on such an important undertaking, not just in relation to the delivery of a submarine, nuclear-powered submarine to Australia, but on those issues of artificial intelligence, of quantum computing, of cyber and other capabilities.</p>
<p>More than one authoritarian regime is presenting itself in the current world climate as a challenge – the DPRK, China as well – and that will be part of our discussions today.  We strongly support U.S. leadership on those challenges.  I want to commend you and your team particularly in terms of the extraordinary efforts you are making in relation to Russia and the destabilizing effect it is having on security and stability on the Ukraine border and more broadly.</p>
<p>I think I said in Washington, D.C. last year that our alliance mission was to work together in line with our values, to keep our people safe, and to preserve and enhance peace and stability.  Having you here together today affirms our commitment to that goal, and I very much look forward to working with you as you are going about your journey here in Australia.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Marise, colleagues, it’s wonderful to be with all of you today.  I want to thank you, first of all, for doing this here in Melbourne.  I was first here in 1980, so I got here actually probably a little bit before Secretary Rice and Secretary Clinton (inaudible).  (Laughter.)  But their footsteps are large to follow, but I’m glad for the opportunity to do that.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful day yesterday spending time at the University of Melbourne.  There’s a deep family connection there.  My stepfather is an alumnus, so that was wonderful to reconnect, also just to talk to some remarkable young Australians who are really the future of the relationship, the partnership between us – incredibly engaged, incredibly smart, incredibly thoughtful about the present and the future.  And also time on campus with companies – Australian, American – working on the challenge of the moment, COVID-19.  And the public-private partnerships that we’re building together even across a great distance are having a great impact.  So it was a wonderful way to start the day – the botanic gardens as well – and connecting to what really grounds us.  So I thank you for the opportunity to be here.</p>
<p>But to everything you said, I couldn’t agree more.  We have talked many times in the year or so that we’ve been working together.  We know that we are stronger and more effective working together to meet these challenges, whether it’s COVID, whether it’s climate, whether it’s emerging technologies, whether it’s the challenge posed by autocratic regimes to the order that we’ve worked so hard to establish together – indeed have been side by side for many, many years in doing that.  We know with respect to the United States that we simply can’t do it without partnerships, and Australia for us is right at the top of the list of partnerships that we’ve been working to strengthen, to invigorate, and to carry forward in all the ways that you said.</p>
<p>So we do indeed have a lot to cover today, both the immediate agenda, challenges posed far away from here but that have an impact on this region as well, but also all of the work that we’re doing together to ensure that we have a free and open Indo-Pacific for many, many years to come.  And I think the United States, Australia as partners, as mates, are essential to that goal, to that shared goal.  I’m glad to be here working today on that.  Thank you for having us.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States condemns the terrorist attack by the Houthis today that struck the commercial airport in Abha, Saudi Arabia, injuring at least a dozen innocent civilians.  We wish the victims a full recovery.  Repeated attacks of the last several weeks have harmed civilians and civilian infrastructure and undermine international efforts for a peaceful solution to the Yemen conflict and threaten the more than 70,000 U.S. citizens living in Saudi Arabia. The Houthis have pursued a dangerous pattern of increasingly obstructive and aggressive actions against Yemenis, Yemen’s neighbors, and the international community.  As President Biden reiterated in his call to King Salman yesterday, the United States is firmly committed to supporting the defense of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The United States, along with the international community, continues to urge de-escalation of the conflict.  The parties should come to the negotiating table to work together and support the new, more inclusive UN-led peace process.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Troika (Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America), Canada, Switzerland, and the European Union are alarmed by the February 9 arrests and detentions of several high-profile political figures.  These troubling actions are part of a recent pattern of arrests and detentions of civil society activists, journalists, and humanitarian workers occurring throughout Sudan these last weeks.  We condemn this harassment and intimidation on the part of Sudan’s military authorities.  This is wholly inconsistent with their stated commitment to participate constructively in a facilitated process to resolve Sudan’s political crisis to return to a democratic transition.</p>
<p>We call for an immediate end to such practices and for the immediate release of all those unjustly detained.  We remind Sudan’s military authorities of their obligations to respect the human rights and guarantee the safety of those detained or arrested and the need to ensure that due process is consistently followed in all cases.  The lifting of the state of emergency, declared at the time of the October 25 military takeover would send a positive signal.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Department of State welcomes the issuance today of a report by a committee of the International Labor Organization (ILO) calling on the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to review, repeal, and revise its laws and practices of employment discrimination against racial and religious minorities in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>This report, produced by the ILO’s <wbr />Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, <wbr />expresses deep concern regarding the PRC’s policies and calls on <wbr />the PRC government to take specific steps toward eliminating <wbr />racial and religious discrimination in employment and occupation, and to amend <wbr />national and regional policies utilizing vocational training and rehabilitation centers for “political re-education&#8221; based on administrative detention.</p>
<p>China joined the ILO in 1919 as one of the founding member states. The United States calls on the PRC to take the steps requested by the Committee of Experts.  We also reiterate our call for the PRC to end its genocide and crimes against humanity perpetrated <wbr />against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, as well as its use of these groups for forced labor in Xinjiang and beyond. The State Department is committed to working with our international partners and allies to end forced labor and strengthen international action against the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The Committee’s report can be found here &#8211; <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_836653.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/&#8212;ed_norm/&#8212;relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_836653.pdf</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States welcomes the offer announced today by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to begin negotiating a new Defense Cooperation Agreement.

<p>Our alliances are a core source of American strength. The United States and Denmark work closely together on a wide range of issues important to both countries, to the NATO Alliance, and to the rest of the world.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Melbourne, Australia</p>
<p>Royal Botanic Gardens</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  It’s great to be with you.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  How would U.S. intervention in the case of a Russian invasion of Ukraine differ to the case of, say, a Chinese incursion into Taiwan?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, it’s hard to compare very, very different situations, but what we’re committed to in the case of Ukraine is doing everything we can to defend Ukraine’s territorial integrity, its sovereignty, its independence, which unfortunately is being challenged right now by Russia.  We’ve made very clear to Russia that there are two paths going forward: there’s a diplomatic path, a path of diplomacy, dialogue to see if we can find answers to security concerns that Russia has expressed and that we’ve expressed about Russia’s conduct; but equally, if Russia chooses to renew its aggression against Ukraine, we’ve made clear – not just us but countries throughout Europe and even beyond – that there’ll be massive consequences.</p>
<p>So my hope is that Russia will be deterred by the actions that we’ve taken to build &#8212; to bring together many, many countries that stand against renewed aggression by Russia in Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  President Biden says that if an invasion occurs, the planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany won’t go ahead.  The German chancellor has been a bit more vague on that.  How would America stop that pipeline given it’s not on U.S. territory?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, the President has been very clear that if there is renewed aggression by Russia in Ukraine, it’s very hard to see gas ever flowing through that pipeline.  And right now the pipeline is actually a source of leverage for us, not for Russia, precisely because gas has not yet begun to flow through it.  To the extent that President Putin wants to see that happen, the idea that that could happen if he commits aggression against Ukraine is very, very hard to see.  So that may make him think twice about taking action in Ukraine.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Who does the Biden administration view as a bigger threat to global security, Russia or China?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  These are, again, very different challenges.  Russia right now poses an immediate challenge not just to Ukraine through the possibility of renewed aggression, but to some very basic principles that are relevant to the security not just of people in Europe but throughout the world, including in Australia – principles like you can’t just change the borders of another country by force; you can’t decide for another country its choices, its policies, with whom it will associate; you can’t exert a sphere of influence that tries to subjugate your neighbors to your will.  Those are the basic principles that are at stake when it comes to Ukraine and Russia’s aggression, and they’re relevant right here in this part of the world just as they are in Europe.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  You’re here for the meeting.  Is the Quad grouping about countering the influence of China in this region?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  The Quad fundamentally is about presenting an affirmative vision and affirmative action to deal with some of the main challenges of our time as well as to find opportunities and to make the most of them.  So bringing these countries together to deal with something that’s afflicting everyone – COVID – that is again about dealing with something very concrete in people’s lives.  How we think about emerging technology and the rules and norms and standards that shape it – the Quad is coming together on that.  How we make our economies more resilient, not only recovering from COVID but producing greater resiliency over time through diversified supply chains, for example – that’s what the Quad is all about.</p>
<p>So it’s coming together, using the talents, the resources, the different skill sets that we – that these four countries have, as well as potentially working with other countries.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Australia’s Defense Minister Peter Dutton has warned that Australia and its allies will lose the next decade unless they stand up to China in the South China Sea.  What’s your take on that?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  What we have to do and what we are doing is standing up for the norms, the rules, the standards, the values that unite it – that unite us.  So this is not about standing against anyone in particular; it is about standing up for a rules-based order, making sure that we uphold those rules and principles if they’re being challenged.  Because it’s exactly that that’s undergirded peace, security, and opportunity for people for decades.  So when they’re being challenged, we have an obligation to stand up.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Against that backdrop, Russia and China’s leaders met on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics earlier this week and they declared that they have a no-limits partnership.  That has to be of some concern given the context that you just painted there.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  China and Russia have been growing closer over many, many years, so this is not – this is not new.  I have to say, if – and we of course were not in the room when the two leaders met, but I would imagine that, for example, China would have some issues with Russia’s threats to Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.  China talks a lot about upholding the principle of sovereignty.  Well, maybe it has something to say about that.  Russian aggression in Ukraine would not be good for anyone.  It wouldn’t be good for China either.  And so one would think that it would have shared some of its concerns with Russia.</p>
<p>Russia and China are talking.  We’re engaged, the United States, with dozens of partners throughout Europe, around the world, NATO, the European Union, the G7, here through the Quad, AUKUS, you name it.  We have a multiplicity of alliances, of partnerships, of coalitions to deal with issues of concern to our people.  That’s actually been our greatest strength.  And these partnerships, these alliances, not only are they voluntary, they’re based on a shared set of values and basic interests.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  You mentioned AUKUS.  The French Government was put out, to say the least, by its submarine contract with Australia being shelved due to the new security pact between Australia, the UK, and the U.S.  The French said that they were blindsided by what happened.  Were they, and who was responsible for that?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Look, I said at the time that we, speaking for ourselves, the United States could have done a better job communicating with our French allies and partners on this.  But we are working incredibly closely together as partners.  We’re doing the same thing through NATO, with the European Union, the G7.  And so I think the strength of that relationship, of that partnership is as good as it’s ever been.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Which country first floated the idea of a security pact between Australia, the U.S., and the UK, including finding a way to have – for Australia to have nuclear submarines?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, I’m not going to go back and revisit the entire history of this, but certainly this is something that was raised early on by Australia, by the United Kingdom.  And of course part of what we’re doing around the world, as I said, is working to revitalize, to re-energize, and, as necessary, to reinvent these alliances and partnerships because for us, as we’re looking at the problems that afflict our people as well as the opportunities, whether it’s dealing with climate, whether it’s dealing with COVID, whether it’s dealing with emerging technologies, whether it’s dealing with security, not a single one of these problems can be effectively addressed by any one of our countries working alone.  We are much stronger when we find ways to work together.  And that’s why we’ve invested so much in not only our traditional alliances, but in creating new coalitions, new partnerships to focus on specific issues.  That’s what AUKUS is about, it’s what the Quad is about, as well as the traditional alliances like NATO and other organizations.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Final question, Mr. Secretary.  The U.S. under Donald Trump’s leadership was beset with internal turmoil and division that hasn’t resolved.  The president ran an erratic foreign and domestic policy, to say the least.  Why would a country like Australia continue to view the U.S. as a reliable ally given that some of those forces that delivered Donald Trump the presidency are still at play?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  No one can say with certainty what the future will bring.  We have to be grounded in the present.  What are the challenges that our people are facing?  How can we best and most effectively deal with them?  We’re convinced that it’s by doing it together, and you start with the countries that share your basic approach, that share your basic interests, that share your basic values.  And nowhere is that more true than between the United States and Australia.  And you go from there.  And ultimately we’re going to be judged, like anyone else is, by what we do and what we achieve.  And we’re living in the present and focused on the – on these challenges, focused on these opportunities, and we start with the conviction that they can best be addressed in partnership, and that’s exactly why we’ve spent a lot of time and effort to re-energize these alliances and these partnerships.  It’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Secretary Blinken, we really appreciate your time.  Thank you for speaking with us again.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks so much.  Good to be with you.</p>

<p>So it’s coming together, using the talents, the resources, the different skill sets that we – that these four countries have, as well as potentially working with other countries.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Australia’s Defense Minister Peter Dutton has warned that Australia and its allies will lose the next decade unless they stand up to China in the South China Sea.  What’s your take on that?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  What we have to do and what we are doing is standing up for the norms, the rules, the standards, the values that unite it – that unite us.  So this is not about standing against anyone in particular; it is about standing up for a rules-based order, making sure that we uphold those rules and principles if they’re being challenged.  Because it’s exactly that that’s undergirded peace, security, and opportunity for people for decades.  So when they’re being challenged, we have an obligation to stand up.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Against that backdrop, Russia and China’s leaders met on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics earlier this week and they declared that they have a no-limits partnership.  That has to be of some concern given the context that you just painted there.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  China and Russia have been growing closer over many, many years, so this is not – this is not new.  I have to say, if – and we of course were not in the room when the two leaders met, but I would imagine that, for example, China would have some issues with Russia’s threats to Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.  China talks a lot about upholding the principle of sovereignty.  Well, maybe it has something to say about that.  Russian aggression in Ukraine would not be good for anyone.  It wouldn’t be good for China either.  And so one would think that it would have shared some of its concerns with Russia.</p>
<p>Russia and China are talking.  We’re engaged, the United States, with dozens of partners throughout Europe, around the world, NATO, the European Union, the G7, here through the Quad, AUKUS, you name it.  We have a multiplicity of alliances, of partnerships, of coalitions to deal with issues of concern to our people.  That’s actually been our greatest strength.  And these partnerships, these alliances, not only are they voluntary, they’re based on a shared set of values and basic interests.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  You mentioned AUKUS.  The French Government was put out, to say the least, by its submarine contract with Australia being shelved due to the new security pact between Australia, the UK, and the U.S.  The French said that they were blindsided by what happened.  Were they, and who was responsible for that?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Look, I said at the time that we, speaking for ourselves, the United States could have done a better job communicating with our French allies and partners on this.  But we are working incredibly closely together as partners.  We’re doing the same thing through NATO, with the European Union, the G7.  And so I think the strength of that relationship, of that partnership is as good as it’s ever been.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Which country first floated the idea of a security pact between Australia, the U.S., and the UK, including finding a way to have – for Australia to have nuclear submarines?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Well, I’m not going to go back and revisit the entire history of this, but certainly this is something that was raised early on by Australia, by the United Kingdom.  And of course part of what we’re doing around the world, as I said, is working to revitalize, to re-energize, and, as necessary, to reinvent these alliances and partnerships because for us, as we’re looking at the problems that afflict our people as well as the opportunities, whether it’s dealing with climate, whether it’s dealing with COVID, whether it’s dealing with emerging technologies, whether it’s dealing with security, not a single one of these problems can be effectively addressed by any one of our countries working alone.  We are much stronger when we find ways to work together.  And that’s why we’ve invested so much in not only our traditional alliances, but in creating new coalitions, new partnerships to focus on specific issues.  That’s what AUKUS is about, it’s what the Quad is about, as well as the traditional alliances like NATO and other organizations.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Final question, Mr. Secretary.  The U.S. under Donald Trump’s leadership was beset with internal turmoil and division that hasn’t resolved.  The president ran an erratic foreign and domestic policy, to say the least.  Why would a country like Australia continue to view the U.S. as a reliable ally given that some of those forces that delivered Donald Trump the presidency are still at play?</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  No one can say with certainty what the future will bring.  We have to be grounded in the present.  What are the challenges that our people are facing?  How can we best and most effectively deal with them?  We’re convinced that it’s by doing it together, and you start with the countries that share your basic approach, that share your basic interests, that share your basic values.  And nowhere is that more true than between the United States and Australia.  And you go from there.  And ultimately we’re going to be judged, like anyone else is, by what we do and what we achieve.  And we’re living in the present and focused on the – on these challenges, focused on these opportunities, and we start with the conviction that they can best be addressed in partnership, and that’s exactly why we’ve spent a lot of time and effort to re-energize these alliances and these partnerships.  It’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Secretary Blinken, we really appreciate your time.  Thank you for speaking with us again.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Thanks so much.  Good to be with you.</p>
