<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I offer my best wishes to the citizens of Kiribati as you celebrate your National Day on July 12.</p>
<p>Our countries share a history of sacrifice dating back over 75 years. Our common economic and climate interests will guide us into the future.  Together, we have helped our institutions and communities increase their capacity, manage the impact of COVID-19, and adapt our response to the climate crisis.  Our friendship is essential to securing a peaceful Pacific where Kiribati can exercise control over its maritime domain and ocean resources. We support sustainable practices in entrepreneurship, fisheries, and ecotourism beneficial to both our countries.  We look forward to continuing our work with Kiribati as a partner to realize our shared goals as Pacific states.</p>
<p>As you commemorate this special day, the United States celebrates with you, and we look forward to many more years of partnership and collaboration.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: 'Open sans',serif; color: #201f1e;">The United States welcomes the announcement that Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan agreed to conclude trade agreements that strengthen civilian cooperation between the two countries and will support the Palestinian people by allowing increased trade between Jordan and the West Bank. These agreements will improve Jordan&#8217;s access to fresh water by an additional 50 million cubic meters this year and allow Jordan’s exports to the West Bank to increase from $160 million a year ago to around $700 million.  It is these kinds of tangible steps that increase prosperity for all and advance regional stability. We congratulate His Majesty King Abdullah II and Foreign Minister Safadi of Jordan and Prime Minister Bennett and Foreign Minister Lapid of Israel for concluding these deals.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>This July 9, we honor the more than 300 lawyers and human rights defenders who were unjustly detained, interrogated, and imprisoned by authorities in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on July 9, 2015, in what is known as the “709 crackdown.” The government of China targeted these individuals in a campaign to intimidate and silence those who sought to work within the PRC’s legal system to help it live up to its human rights obligations and commitments and to effect positive change in their society.</p>
<p>Six years later, the government continues to hold many of those initially arrested, such as Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi, in pre-trial detention. Chinese authorities disbarred, detained, and prosecuted others, including lawyers Li Yuhan and Yu Wensheng, when they came forward to represent these brave human rights defenders. We call on the PRC to release those who have been detained or imprisoned in connection with the 709 crackdown, to ensure their family members are free of harassment, and to reinstate the lawyers who were disbarred.</p>
<p>The PRC’s targeting of lawyers and activists who are simply trying to pursue legal redress for their fellow citizens undermines social stability and the rule of law. The United States will always support brave individuals who seek to build a more just, stable, and prosperous society.</p>
