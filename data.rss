					<description><![CDATA[<p>Lisa Peterson, Acting Assistant SecretaryBureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Press Briefing Room</p>
<p><strong>MS PETERSON:</strong>  It’s a privilege to be here for the release of the 46th Human Rights Report, which we submitted to the U.S. Congress earlier today.</p>
<p>For nearly five decades, the United States has issued the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, addressing the status of internationally recognized human rights in all countries that are members of the United Nations.</p>
<p>The Annual Human Rights Report includes 198 reports on individual countries and territories, and provides an objective record of whether and how human rights and fundamental freedoms are protected by law and in practice around the world.  The individual reports draw on information from a range of governmental, nongovernmental, and media sources.  The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which I currently lead, is at the forefront of preparing these reports along with colleagues across the department and our embassies in the field, and I am proud to note that this June we will mark our 45th anniversary.</p>
<p>In 1977, the Carter administration oversaw the establishment of what is now the DRL Bureau, with the mission of advancing individual liberty and democratic freedoms around the world, and upholding the truth enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that all individuals are born equal in dignity and rights.</p>
<p>Over those four and a half decades, DRL has rolled up our sleeves alongside U.S. Government colleagues as well as countless brave human rights defenders and other civil society leaders to promote our namesake values of democracy, human rights, and labor.</p>
<p>Despite innumerable achievements over that period to defend and strengthen democracy and to promote and protect human rights and labor rights, serious challenges persist.  Some of today’s challenges to democracy and human rights are longstanding and familiar; others are new and evolving.  All demand continued leadership from the United States in close collaboration with our partners and allies across the globe.</p>
<p>On the home front, strengthening our democracy in the United States and ensuring that the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all people are protected and advanced is a critical part of the Biden-Harris administration’s commitment to global leadership on human rights.  We can’t be credible advocates for human rights abroad if we don’t live up to the same principles at home.  We do not claim a moral high ground, but we do, in the words of our Constitution, resolve “to form a more perfect union,” which means we must continue to address the many human rights challenges in our own country.</p>
<p>The Summit for Democracy held this past December served as a rallying point to address these challenges, both new and old.  President Biden brought together world leaders, civil society, and private sector representatives in a shared commitment to push back against authoritarianism, fight corruption, and advance respect for human rights.</p>
<p>We’re taking forward the momentum of the first summit through a year of action in which governments, including the United States, are working to fulfill our commitments and tackle human rights challenges at home and globally in partnership with civil society.</p>
<p>The yearly Human Rights Report speaks to the importance that we place on these goals.  The report does not attempt to catalog every human rights related incident.  It is not an effort by the U.S. Government to judge others.  It does not reach legal conclusions, rank countries, or draw comparisons.</p>
<p>We’ve seen all too well in recent years that around the world, democracy and human rights have been threatened and undermined by disinformation, misinformation, and outright lies.  So our objective with the Human Rights Report is simple: bring the facts to the table.  It is only when we’re armed with the truth that the United States can most effectively use our voice and our influence to call attention to violations and abuses of human rights worldwide, and press the perpetrators of these violations and abuses to change course and end their egregious conduct.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this press briefing, the 2021 Human Rights Report will be available to the public on the State Department website at <a href="http://www.state.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.state.gov&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649882169935000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Uk4X6h8Vb1L2CEV1R66H_">www.state.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for being here today, and with that, I am happy to take your questions.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Hello.  Guita Aryan, Voice of America, Persian service.  The Secretary just mentioned Iran as one of the examples of countries where human rights violation is rampant, and he referred to abduction or attempt to abduct dissidents overseas.  A little over a year ago the Secretary also issued a statement designating a number of IRGC commanders for having a hand in the arrest, imprisonment, and torture of protesters a couple of a years ago.  And in continuation of that statement, the Secretary said that the U.S. will continue to support the Iranian people.  Now how has the Biden administration helped or supported the Iranian people during this past year, given that the list of violations of human rights on Iran in the report is, I don’t know, 10, 15 lines long?</p>
<p><strong>MS PETERSON:</strong>  So we continue to find ways, both in public and in very discreet manners, to support people who are trying to advance the human rights situation in Iran.  As you note, we have also put into play a variety of sanctions tools.  I am sorry, I don’t have details in front of me at this moment, but it is something that I would be happy to circle back to you on.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Janne.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Thank you.  On the North Korean human rights issues.  Human rights violation are currently ongoing in North Korea, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is – massacred their own citizens.  What is the final destination for the United States to resolve the North Korean human rights problem?</p>
<p><strong>MS PETERSON:</strong>  So we do recognize that the DPRK is among the most repressive, authoritarian states in the world.  And obviously, we remain deeply concerned about reports of systemic, widespread, and gross human rights violations and abuses committed by the DPRK Government.  And we certainly hope that one day justice may be achieved for the people of North Korea.</p>
<p>Similar to the very difficult operating circumstances with Iran, we continue to work with the international community to raise awareness, document and preserve information on human rights abuses and violations, and increase access to independent information.  We also seek to impose sanctions on those who are complicit in abuses and violations, and as always, promote respect for human rights within the DPRK.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Do you have any tools use for the – resolve this human rights issue in North Korea, or you don’t have anything?  Because this is long time being the North Koreans in human right – abuse the human rights.</p>
<p><strong>MS PETERSON:</strong>  Obviously, that is an extremely difficult environment to be able to influence, but it is an area that we continue to focus our efforts on to try to raise awareness around the issues within North Korea.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yeah, how do you assess the human rights record in the Middle East?  Are they deteriorated, or how do you – how do you see that?</p>
<p><strong>MS PETERSON:  </strong>I would hesitate to speak to the Middle East as a region as a whole.  Each country has its individual circumstances.  Some have progress, some less so.  So I would hesitate to speak on an entire region.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>On Russia, the report obviously covers the 2021 period, but Russia seems to be committing even worse atrocities this year in Ukraine and its repression at home.  I would wonder if you would agree with that characterization.  And then secondly, if you could expand on why that would be the case – do you think that Vladimir Putin has a sense of impunity because he hasn’t faced repercussions in the past?</p>
<p><strong>MS PETERSON:  </strong>So I will share that because the report does focus on 2021 and a lot of the preparation is very focused on what went into those reports, I was struck by the manner in which the listing of issues with Russia have simply been amplified in the context of the Russia-Ukraine context.  As to why that has happened, I will not speculate on what is motivating Putin.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Sir.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Thank you.  On Georgia, there are some serious concerns about Georgia’s human rights record.  Many believe within the country and by respondents here in DC, former diplomats, that Georgia is leaning towards illiberalism.  Secretary Blinken mentioned that it’s irrespective to friends or not friendly countries, that applies – that human rights – human rights standard applies equally to everyone.  I just want to gather your thoughts how far – is the United States willing to go further if the former partners – and Georgia has been partnering with the U.S. for the last 30 years – is violating systematically human rights within its territory?  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MS PETERSON:  </strong>So, clearly, we do have a list of human rights concerns with Georgia.  I will also note that we have been following actions such as the October elections.  And they’re – while those were characterized as candidates generally being able to campaign freely, but there were observations from OSCE observers that the competitive environment was marred by widespread and consistent allegations of intimidation.  I do think that this is an appropriate example of how we do see problems in countries and we use the human rights reports to analyze and understand those problems, but in understanding and analyzing we try to find ways to move forward, and as long as there is opportunity for engagement with a government we will continue to engage on those human rights issues.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Humeyra.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi, thank you.  I know that the report covers last year, but I just wanted to ask you something a little bit more contemporary.  There has been a lot of reporting – an increase in reporting of accounts of rape and sexual violence from Ukraine.  UN human rights monitors are seeking to verify these allegations of sexual violence by Russian forces.  Is that something the United States is picking up, and do you think that it has reached a level where rape is used as a weapon of war?</p>
<p><strong>MS PETERSON:  </strong>So the reports of sexual violence are certainly something that we are tracking, both in our own efforts to understand what is happening in Ukraine, in our own efforts to catalogue what is happening there, and through the various citizen-level mechanisms and multilateral approaches that are all gathering information.  We are hearing horrific stories; I’m sure you are hearing horrific stories as well.  And that is something that we will come continue to gather and ultimately, ideally, have it feed into transitional justice mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Thank you.  Following up a bit on that as well – sorry to bring it back to Ukraine.  There’s also been a claim by the Ukraine’s UN ambassador that Russia has taken more than 121,000 children out of Ukraine and is reportedly drafting a bill to simply and accelerate adoption procedures for orphans.  This is something obviously coming from the Ukrainian side.  Is this something that the U.S. is also tracking and looking into in terms of the kind of behavior that has been reported by the Ukrainians?</p>
<p><strong>MS PETERSON:  </strong>This is certainly something that we have heard about.  This is something that we will continue to try to learn more about and try to determine what action may be possible.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Final question?  Yes.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Yes.<strong>  </strong>These reports every year include a lot of details about LGBTQ rights abroad.  And I’m just wondering if you have any thoughts about folks who might be critical of that in the context of what’s happening here in the United States with bills like the “Don’t say gay” bill in Florida, efforts to discriminate against transgender folks, et cetera.  Any thoughts on that point?</p>
<p><strong>MS PETERSON:  </strong>So this will not be the first issue on which people will say, well, what about your own country?  I do think – again, within the framing of the Summit for Democracy and the approach that this administration has taken, we’re not trying to pretend that these are not issues that we are grappling with here in the United States.  This report, because it is very clearly focused on the rest of the world, we do dig in on other countries.  We do not have a mandate to do a report on our own circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Final question, Andrea.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:  </strong>Hi there.  Any comment on Russia’s arrest of Kara-Murza just hours after he appeared on two American networks from Moscow speaking out against the Russian war?</p>
<p><strong>MS PETERSON:  </strong>I would speak in general about Russia’s crackdown – further crackdown on freedom of information, freedom of expression in Russia in the context of the Ukraine conflict.  This was space that they were closing even before the conflict started.  Their efforts to close down that space have simply grown exponentially since the start of the conflict, and we would want to see that space reopened so that Russians can understand what is happening within their neighborhood and what their government is doing.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:  </strong>Thank you very much, Assistant Secretary Peterson.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Press Briefing Room</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Good afternoon.  Good to see everyone.</p>
<p>Today, I once again have the privilege of introducing and welcoming Secretary Blinken back to this briefing room so that he can mark the release of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/">2021 Human Rights Report</a>.  Secretary Blinken will have some opening remarks, and then he’ll take a couple of questions.</p>
<p>After that, I will then introduce Lisa Peterson, who’s the acting assistant secretary of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.  Acting Assistant Secretary Peterson will have remarks of her own, and then she will stick around for a few more questions, and then we’ll proceed with our regularly scheduled programming.</p>
<p>So without further ado, Secretary Blinken.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Ned, thank you very much.  So we got a full program for you this afternoon.  I am very pleased to be here with Acting Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Lisa Peterson to, indeed, introduce the 2021 Human Rights Report.</p>
<p>So this is the second time that I’ve joined the launch of this report as Secretary, because it’s important to U.S. foreign policy; it’s important to this department; it’s important to me personally.  For many years running, we have seen an alarming recession of democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights in many parts of the world.  In the time since releasing our previous report, that backsliding has, unfortunately, continued.</p>
<p>In few places have the human consequences of this decline been as stark as they are in the Russian Government’s brutal war on Ukraine.  That’s especially true in recent weeks, as Russian forces have been pushed back from towns and cities they occupied or surrounded, and evidence mounts of their widespread atrocities.  We see what this receding tide is leaving in its wake – the bodies, hands bound, left on streets; the theaters, train stations, apartment buildings reduced to rubble with civilians inside.  We hear it in the testimonies of women and girls who’ve been raped and the <span>besieged</span> civilians starving and freezing to death.</p>
<p>In response, people and governments in every region are voicing their condemnation and calling for those responsible to be held accountable.  This global outcry has been clarifying.  In its disdain for human life and dignity, the Kremlin has reinvigorated a belief in people worldwide that there are human rights that everyone everywhere should enjoy, and underscored why these rights are worth defending.</p>
<p>At the same time, civil society, governments, and people around the world are rightly pointing out that Ukraine is, tragically, far from the only place where gross abuses are being perpetrated.  They want the international community to shine a spotlight on human rights abuses wherever they’re being committed and to bring the same urgency to stopping abuses and holding perpetrators accountable.</p>
<p>The United States shares that goal.  This report is just one of the ways that we’re working to achieve it.  It contains individual chapters on nearly 200 countries and territories, each of which offers factual, objective, and thorough accounting of their records on internationally recognized human rights.  Whether a country is a friend or one with which we have real differences, the measuring stick we apply is the same.</p>
<p>That reflects a core principle of human rights: they’re universal.  People of every nationality, race, gender, disability, and age are entitled to these rights no matter what they believe, whom they love, or any other characteristics.  This is especially important as a number of governments continue to claim, falsely, that human rights need to be applied based on the local context.  Little coincidence that many of the same governments are among the worst abusers of human rights.</p>
<p>The universal nature of human rights also means that we have to hold ourselves accountable to the same standards.  Even as this report looks outward to countries around the world, we’ve acknowledged from day one of this administration that we have challenges here in the United States.  We take seriously our responsibility to address these shortcomings, and we know that the way to do it matters: together with citizens and communities, out in the open, transparently – not trying to pretend problems don’t exist or sweeping them under a rug.</p>
<p>And in fact, that’s what distinguishes democracies – our willingness, our commitment to pursue that more perfect union.  And practicing what we preach at home gives us greater legitimacy when we encourage governments abroad to do the same thing.</p>
<p>The report also shows that the United States is concerned not only with civil and political rights, but also economic, social, cultural rights.  That means, for example, affirming that promoting access to education and health services, including for reproductive health, is just as critical to advancing human rights as defending freedom of expression and assembly.</p>
<p>These interconnected rights are critical to ensuring individuals can reach their full potential, and they’re critical to sustaining healthy democracies.</p>
<p>So with that context, let me highlight some of the most alarming findings of the report, which I want to emphasize covers the events of 2021.</p>
<p>Governments are growing more brazen in reaching across borders to threaten and attack critics.  To give just a few examples, over the last year alone, Iranian intelligence agents plotted to kidnap an Iranian American journalist from her home in Brooklyn; the Assad regime threatened Syrians who were cooperating with efforts in Germany’s courts to prosecute former officials for atrocities; the Lukashenka regime in Belarus forcibly diverted an international commercial flight to arrest an independent journalist.</p>
<p>Governments are locking up more critics at home.  Today, more than a million political prisoners are being held in over 65 countries.  They include more than 600 people unjustly imprisoned in Cuba for taking part in peaceful protests last July; countless Russian anti-corruption activists and opposition leaders, including Aleksey Navalny; opposition presidential candidates in Benin; and Egyptian advocates like human rights lawyer Mohamed El-Baqer.</p>
<p>We’ve also seen a rise in governments arbitrarily detaining individuals to try to gain leverage in bilateral relationships, to use them as human pawns.</p>
<p>The Chinese Government continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang against predominantly Muslim Uyghurs, among other minority groups, to erode fundamental freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong, and to carry out systematic repression in Tibet.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the Taliban’s takeover precipitated a humanitarian crisis, and has resulted in serious erosion of human rights, from arbitrary detentions of women, protesters, and journalists, to reprisals against security forces for the former government, to growing restrictions on where women and girls can study or work.</p>
<p>In Ethiopia, all parties to the country’s conflict, as well as Eritrean forces, have committed atrocities, and thousands of Ethiopians are being unjustly detained in life-threatening conditions.</p>
<p>We invest so much effort into documenting these and other abuses year after year, not only because it aligns our most sacred values, but also because respect for human rights is a fundamental part of upholding the international rules-based order, which is crucial to America’s enduring security and prosperity.  Governments that violate human rights are almost always the same ones that flout other key parts of that order, just as – such as invading, coercing, or threatening trade rules – excuse me – threatening other countries or breaking trade rules.  So our interest in standing up for human rights isn’t only principled; it is vital to our national security.</p>
<p>Here are some of the other ways that we’re working to support human rights.  When senior members of the State Department travel abroad, we meet with human rights advocates, with journalists, and other frontline defenders, as do our ambassadors at every post, even when foreign governments make it clear that they wish we would not.</p>
<p>We work with the Treasury Department to apply sanctions and impose visa restrictions on human rights abusers and those who enable and profit from them through the Global Magnitsky Act, the Khashoggi Ban, and other tools.</p>
<p>We methodically collect, preserve, and analyze evidence of atrocities and make this information available to the appropriate bodies.  Indeed, it was the department’s rigorous documentation, which included our own fact finding and reports by a range of independent, impartial sources, including human rights organizations, that provided a basis for my determination last month that Burma’s military committed genocide and crimes against humanities against Rohingya.</p>
<p>We work with business to foster greater respect for human rights, both by encouraging compliance with labor standards and discouraging exports to governments and other entities that may use those goods or services to commit abuses.</p>
<p>We’re fully engaged in multilateral institutions, even flawed ones.  After regaining a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, we just led a successful effort to suspend Russia from that body, because a country that’s perpetrating gross and systematic violations of human rights shouldn’t sit on a body whose job it is to protect those rights.</p>
<p>And we’re working to strengthen democracy, human rights, and the fight against corruption through the Summit for Democracy.  Last December, President Biden convened 100 world leaders, as well as representatives from civil society and the private sector, for the first summit.  That kicked off a year of action that we’re in the midst of pursuing.  We’re focused on delivering progress, not just pronouncements, by encouraging countries to make concrete commitments to advance human rights and democracy.  And we’re holding one another to our pledges.</p>
<p>Before turning to questions, let me just thank everyone who’s had a hand in producing this report.  This is an enterprise that cuts across the entire State Department.  We have local staff and career officers in posts around the world as well as here in Washington whose determination and rigor are shining a bright light on these issues every single day, and the brave human rights defenders, journalists, and others documenting those abuses from up close, frequently at grave risk to themselves and their loved ones.  This is your report too, and we thank you for it.</p>
<p>So we’re approaching the 15-month mark since this administration took office.  We still don’t have a confirmed assistant secretary for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.  Outstanding career officers have stepped up to lead a devoted DRL team that carries this mission forward, and I want to thank you, Lisa, in particular for exceptional service and stewardship at this time.</p>
<p>But for the United States to be the best possible advocate of human rights and democracy worldwide, we need a Senate-confirmed assistant secretary.  We have a highly qualified nominee for this position, Sarah Margon.  I urge the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to allow her nomination to move forward soon.</p>
<p>With that, I’m happy to start taking some questions, and then I’ll turn it over to Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Missy.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Well, (inaudible) again.  Could you talk about how you think about the tension between the desire to elevate human rights as part of American foreign policy and the desire to halt this recession that you mentioned with the need to shore up alliances that are seen as crucial to American interests with some countries that have problematic human rights records?  I’m thinking of Egypt and its relationship with Palestinian authorities, or Saudi Arabia and its oil supplies.  How do you think about that tension?  And how do you respond to the criticism that the United States is implicitly condoning abuses by those governments?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  So this not a new tension.  In some ways, it’s an age-old one.  And administrations that in the past and now ours that are putting human rights and democracy front and center in their foreign policy have to confront it, and we work through it every single day.  It’s different from country to country, partner to partner, circumstance to circumstance.</p>
<p>But I think what we’re doing is to just be very forthright in what we stand for, what we look for, and we try to work with countries to make progress.  And again, this varies from place to place, but we’re not holding back in what we’re saying.  We’re not holding back in what we’re trying to do, but we also are looking carefully to determine how we think we can be most effective in advancing the ball.  And whether that is focusing in public on some of the concerns, shortcomings, problems that we’re seeing, whether that’s pushing people in private, we have to make that judgment in each and every case.</p>
<p>Having said that, this report, a public report, is very clear about the issues, challenges, concerns we have across the world with nearly 200 countries.  And as I said before, it doesn’t distinguish between friend and foe.  We apply the same standard everywhere.  We do it publicly as in this report.  We do it publicly often when I have an opportunity to speak, including in the countries that we’re visiting where we have concerns.</p>
<p>But again, part of this is making determinations on how we think we can be most effective.  And in most cases, this is a process.  It’s not flipping a switch.  We don’t expect that things will change from one day to the other.  It’s the result of sustained engagement and trying to move partners along.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d just say that I think we have in a way added credibility, precisely because when it comes to our own shortcomings at home we’re not dodging them, we’re not ignoring them, we’re not denying them.  We’re confronting them directly, and in so doing we strengthen our position, we strengthen our voice in advancing rights.  But again, this is a process.  It’s not something that happens from one day to the next.  We’re engaged in it.  Let’s see where we are over the coming years and the progress that we make in individual places..</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Francesco.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>  Mr. Secretary, you were mentioning the situation in Ukraine.  Have you made an assessment of any alleged use of chemical agents or weapons in Ukraine?  And how credible would you say the reports coming from the Mariupol area are, or do you have any intelligence about an imminent use of chemical weapons?</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  So when it comes to the reports you’re referring to, we’re not in a position to confirm anything.  I don’t think the Ukrainians are either.  But let me say this:  We had credible information that Russian forces may use a variety of riot-control agents, including tear gas, mixed with chemical agents, that would cause stronger symptoms to weaken and incapacitate entrenched Ukrainian fighters and civilians as part of the aggressive campaign to take Mariupol.  We shared that information with Ukraine as well as with other partners, and we’re in direct conversation with partners to try to determine what actually has happened.</p>
<p>So this is a real concern.  It’s a concern that we had from before the aggression started.  I think I’ve pointed to the possibility that these kinds of weapons would be used, and it’s something that we’re very, very focused on.</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  All right.  Lisa, over to you.  Thanks, folks.  See you later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Press Briefing Room</p>
<p><strong>MR PRICE:</strong>  Good afternoon.  Good to see everyone.</p>
<p>Today, I once again have the privilege of introducing and welcoming Secretary Blinken back to this briefing room so that he can mark the release of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/">2021 Human Rights Report</a>.  Secretary Blinken will have some opening remarks, and then he’ll take a couple of questions.</p>
<p>After that, I will then introduce Lisa Peterson, who’s the acting assistant secretary of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.  Acting Assistant Secretary Peterson will have remarks of her own, and then she will stick around for a few more questions, and then we’ll proceed with our regularly scheduled programming.</p>
<p>So without further ado, Secretary Blinken.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Ned, thank you very much.  So we got a full program for you this afternoon.  I am very pleased to be here with Acting Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Lisa Peterson to, indeed, introduce the 2021 Human Rights Report.</p>
<p>So this is the second time that I’ve joined the launch of this report as Secretary, because it’s important to U.S. foreign policy; it’s important to this department; it’s important to me personally.  For many years running, we have seen an alarming recession of democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights in many parts of the world.  In the time since releasing our previous report, that backsliding has, unfortunately, continued.</p>
<p>In few places have the human consequences of this decline been as stark as they are in the Russian Government’s brutal war on Ukraine.  That’s especially true in recent weeks, as Russian forces have been pushed back from towns and cities they occupied or surrounded, and evidence mounts of their widespread atrocities.  We see what this receding tide is leaving in its wake – the bodies, hands bound, left on streets; the theaters, train stations, apartment buildings reduced to rubble with civilians inside.  We hear it in the testimonies of women and girls who’ve been raped and the <span>besieged</span> civilians starving and freezing to death.</p>
<p>In response, people and governments in every region are voicing their condemnation and calling for those responsible to be held accountable.  This global outcry has been clarifying.  In its disdain for human life and dignity, the Kremlin has reinvigorated a belief in people worldwide that there are human rights that everyone everywhere should enjoy, and underscored why these rights are worth defending.</p>
<p>At the same time, civil society, governments, and people around the world are rightly pointing out that Ukraine is, tragically, far from the only place where gross abuses are being perpetrated.  They want the international community to shine a spotlight on human rights abuses wherever they’re being committed and to bring the same urgency to stopping abuses and holding perpetrators accountable.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good morning, everyone.  I am very pleased for this opportunity to meet with the High Commissioner for Refugees at the UN Filippo Grandi.  It’s safe to say that this is a time of extraordinary challenge for everything that you’re doing and everything that we’re so indebted to you and your team for doing.</p>
<p>I believe, as you said, the number of displaced people around the world now is somewhere in the vicinity of 95 million people.  And within that huge number of refugees, I think if you added up all of the refugees and tried to put them in one country, it would be larger than the population of Spain, South Korea, any number of countries.  This is a challenge that has been with us for well over the past decade.  When I was last in government, we were dealing with particularly acute challenges – of course, Syria, Iraq, but also in many other parts of the world from Africa to Southeast Asia to our own hemisphere.</p>
<p>We’ve only seen that challenge increase, and of course, Ukraine has now added to the mix with Russian aggression displacing within Ukraine or outside of Ukraine two thirds of the children in that country, as well as of, course, many, many adults.</p>
<p>So we are simply grateful for the work that you’re doing every single day to try to meet the needs of those who have been forced in one way or another from their homes.</p>
<p>The partnership that we have between the United States and UNHCR, working together to find ways to resettle people, to care for them, and I think as well the work that we need to do together not only to resettle, ultimately end conflicts so that people can go home, but also to find more effective ways in helping those communities support the refugees that are with them.</p>
<p>So in all of these ways, there is a lot of work to be done, a lot of work we’re doing every single day between us.  But mostly this is an opportunity as well just to say thank you, because what you’re doing is an invaluable service to humanity at a time when it’s more needed than ever.  So welcome.</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  Mr. Secretary, how will the U.S. expedite getting Ukrainians &#8212;</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Please.</p>
<p><b>MR GRANDI:</b>  Bear with me, just a few words also on my side to thank Secretary Blinken and his colleagues for welcoming us here at the State Department.  And I just want – he said it all, really.  I just want to add, this figure that he mentioned, 95 million – maybe 96 by the way, who knows – has gone up by 12 million in less than two months with the crisis in Ukraine, with the Russian offensive against Ukraine and the flight of so many people.  So that will be a priority for us to discuss and already I’ve been here a couple of days in Washington and had very good discussions on how to respond to this crisis both in neighboring countries and inside Ukraine.</p>
<p>But then, of course, an important message that I’m sure everybody will agree here around the table is that that crisis should not make us forget everything else.  We’ve been dealing intensely together with the Afghanistan situation for the past few months, but there are many, unfortunately many, crises in Africa, in the Western Hemisphere, that involve a huge displacement component, and therefore I look forward to continuing our cooperation.</p>
<p>The United States is UNHCR’s by far largest donor.  It is the largest resettlement country and with our partnership with the United States in these areas has been extremely strong.  And I want to take this opportunity to thank this administration.  Without the United States, we could not be as effective as you kindly recognized us to be, and we look forward to even strengthening even further this partnership, which is globally and domestically extremely important.  So thank you very much.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Room</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</b>  Good morning, everyone.  I am very pleased for this opportunity to meet with the High Commissioner for Refugees at the UN Filippo Grandi.  It’s safe to say that this is a time of extraordinary challenge for everything that you’re doing and everything that we’re so indebted to you and your team for doing.</p>
<p>I believe, as you said, the number of displaced people around the world now is somewhere in the vicinity of 95 million people.  And within that huge number of refugees, I think if you added up all of the refugees and tried to put them in one country, it would be larger than the population of Spain, South Korea, any number of countries.  This is a challenge that has been with us for well over the past decade.  When I was last in government, we were dealing with particularly acute challenges – of course, Syria, Iraq, but also in many other parts of the world from Africa to Southeast Asia to our own hemisphere.</p>
<p>We’ve only seen that challenge increase, and of course, Ukraine has now added to the mix with Russian aggression displacing within Ukraine or outside of Ukraine two thirds of the children in that country, as well as of, course, many, many adults.</p>
<p>So we are simply grateful for the work that you’re doing every single day to try to meet the needs of those who have been forced in one way or another from their homes.</p>
<p>The partnership that we have between the United States and UNHCR, working together to find ways to resettle people, to care for them, and I think as well the work that we need to do together not only to resettle, ultimately end conflicts so that people can go home, but also to find more effective ways in helping those communities support the refugees that are with them.</p>
<p>So in all of these ways, there is a lot of work to be done, a lot of work we’re doing every single day between us.  But mostly this is an opportunity as well just to say thank you, because what you’re doing is an invaluable service to humanity at a time when it’s more needed than ever.  So welcome.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p><i>In support of the effort to achieve global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050, and in support of the effort to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions from the international shipping sector by the same year, the United States is charting a course to advance domestic and international green shipping corridors.</i></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping sector are significant and rising.  Shipping would be the eighth largest emitter if it were a “country,” and by 2050, emissions from the sector are projected to increase by up to 50% from 2018 levels under a business-as-usual scenario.  This trajectory is not compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement.  To support the effort to achieve global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050, the United States has committed to work with countries to reach zero emissions from international shipping by the same year.</p>
<p>Green shipping corridors can spur early and rapid adoption of fuels and technologies that, on a lifecycle basis, deliver low- and zero-emissions across the maritime sector, placing the sector on a pathway to full decarbonization.  <b>The United States envisions green shipping corridors as maritime routes that showcase low- and zero-emission lifecycle fuels and technologies with the ambition to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions across all aspects of the corridor in support of sector-wide decarbonization no later than 2050.</b>  There are multiple pathways through which a fully decarbonized corridor can be achieved; this green shipping corridors framework therefore provides maritime stakeholders the flexibility to choose the path that best suits their needs.</p>
<p>There is a growing movement of countries and non-state actors that are focused on green shipping corridors.  In addition, private sector actors, including major users of maritime shipping, are increasingly making climate commitments and seeking opportunities to decarbonize their supply chains.  For our part, the United States is partnering internationally, working on implementation domestically, and investing in the research and development needed to help ensure we have the solutions necessary to meet our commitments.<sup>1</sup>  Within this growing movement, however, there is not yet a shared understanding of what it means for a maritime corridor to be “green.”  This document is intended to contribute to a common vision of green shipping corridors and advance the effort to establish them across the ocean and along coasts and inland waterways, so that maritime stakeholders may act as a united front to tackle the climate crisis.<i> </i></p>
<p><b>Charting a Course for Green Shipping Corridors</b></p>
<p>Achieving zero emissions from maritime transportation over the coming years and decades will require research, development, demonstration, and deployment at a massive scale, as well as enabling policies that incentivize the shift to low- and zero-emission fuels and technologies as soon as possible.  Adoption of these fuels and technologies, while limited in the short term, will rapidly accelerate once the supply chain is established and governments and the shipping sector signal their intent for energy transition.</p>
<p>Green shipping corridors are meant to accelerate this early adoption phase. They therefore should strive for emissions reductions that push the envelope beyond business-as-usual, demonstrating a commitment to achieve full decarbonization through sustained efforts.  Green shipping corridors will not achieve zero emissions across all aspects of the corridor overnight.  Instead, the journey to establish a fully decarbonized corridor is a series of steps and actions taken over time to cover all aspects of the route.</p>
<p>One of the first steps in creating a green shipping corridor is to convene relevant stakeholders across the value chain and to outline anticipated timelines, targets, and achievements.  Creating a fully decarbonized green shipping corridor is a process, which will require long-term plans to help participants achieve their emissions reduction goals.  Stakeholder engagement will be critical, especially with residents in communities with environmental justice concerns, to ensure strategies are tailored to address the priorities and goals of near-port communities.</p>
<p><b>Demonstrating Progress and Success  </b></p>
<p>In the effort to confront the climate crisis, advance environmental justice, and drive maritime emissions to zero, it is not enough to only announce intentions.  Ports, carriers, and other actors in the value chain are encouraged to demonstrate progress, commitment, and accountability.  Local and state governments, as well as the Federal Government, can help by convening stakeholders, enforcing regulations, and crafting policy that supports green corridor development.  All stakeholders should share information on green corridor development on a regular basis and to be as transparent as possible in the data and information shared.</p>
<p>Such information sharing should include publication of baseline emissions and energy inventories with regular updates on progress toward targets and goals.  As additional data on the successes of the corridor operations become available, those data should be reported using verifiable methods and metrics that can be replicated over time to demonstrate improvement.  This data and information sharing helps to ensure that metrics and calculations are comparable across other corridors and varying technologies, sharing information for those considering similar measures and providing unbiased information for decision-making.  To achieve zero-emission operations, stakeholders should use lifecycle emissions assessment tools and analyses that incorporate internationally accepted methodologies.</p>
<p>Participants in a green shipping corridor effort should be transparent not only about data but also about their role in the effort.  As such, publicly available information should also include value-chain actors such as ports, terminal operators, vessel owners and operators, charter companies, beneficial cargo owners, and others such as logistics companies that are engaged in this important effort.</p>
<p><b>Building Blocks for Green Shipping Corridors</b></p>
<p>Planning for green corridors should consider the needs and abilities of all corridor stakeholders.  Possible components of the green shipping corridor planning process could include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Identify and convene relevant stakeholders</i><i></i></li>
<li><i>Define the scope, boundaries, metrics, and the framework for analysis</i><i></i></li>
<li><i>Incorporate lifecycle-emissions estimates into equipment, materials, and fueling infrastructure planning and development decisions</i><i></i></li>
<li><i>Estimate a baseline emissions inventory for port and/or vessel operations that can be publicly available and used to craft emissions reduction targets</i><i></i></li>
<li><i>Work with stakeholders and communities to develop an implementation plan that outlines a pathway to achieving emissions reductions targets</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Building on the planning process, there are a number of building blocks for implementation of green corridors to reach the goal of full decarbonization.  Elements of this implementation process could include, but are not limited to, the deployment and/or operation of:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Alternative refueling or recharging infrastructure to support zero emissions port and terminal equipment operations</i><i></i></li>
<li><i>Support vessels and commercial harbor craft using low- or zero-emission</i><i>fuels and technologies</i><i></i></li>
<li><i>Ocean-going vessels using low- or zero-emission fuels and technologies</i><i></i></li>
<li><i>Zero-emissions fuels, bunkering, and refueling capabilities for vessels</i><i>including electrification and cold ironing</i><i></i></li>
<li><i>Energy efficiency and operations optimization activities that lead to reduced overall energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Looking Ahead</b></p>
<p>Green shipping corridors are a key means of spurring the early adoption of zero-emission fuels and technologies that will help place the sector on a credible pathway to achieve zero emissions no later than 2050.  The United States welcomes and encourages the growing movement to establish green shipping corridors and calls on countries and value-chain actors around the world to adopt ambitious actions to implement green shipping corridors and to create a clean future for maritime transportation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken will deliver remarks and participate in a conversation with students, faculty, and leadership of Howard University at 4:30 p.m. today, Tuesday, April 12, 2022.  The Secretary will be joined by Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. S.

<p>Secretary Blinken and Minister Jaishankar will meet with Indian students, scholars, and researchers who have worked in the United States, and U.S. students, scholars, and researchers who have studied, worked, or conducted research at an Indian higher education institution.  This event is an opportunity to build off yesterday’s announcement during the 2+2 Ministerial of the formation of a ‘Working Group on Education and Skill Training.’  Howard University’s significant role deepening people-to-people ties between India and the United States make this an ideal setting to continue developing the links between our citizens in such an important area of cooperation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States of America, I wish the people of the Kingdom of Thailand a healthy and prosperous year ahead as you celebrate Songkran, the Thai New Year.</p>
<p>The alliance and friendship between the United States and Thailand are built on a shared commitment to a safe and secure future for all American and Thai people.  Together, we have fought infectious diseases, responded to natural disasters, and protected economic security across the Pacific Ocean.  Our partnership endures, and we stand ready to face evolving challenges &#8212; like the pandemic and the climate crisis &#8212; that impact all global citizens.  At the same time, we will continue to build on our strong people-to-people ties and shared values.</p>
<p>After two years in which the COVID-19 pandemic has dampened festivities, this year’s celebration is a particularly poignant reminder of how holiday traditions express a nation’s deepest values and aspirations.  We offer our best wishes to all Thai people in the coming year.</p>
