					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>As President Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war enters its fourth month, the United States recognizes the staggering human toll of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.  Civilian casualties continue to mount, as do widespread reports of war crimes and other atrocities perpetrated by Russia’s forces in Ukraine.  As the people of Ukraine continue to fight bravely against Russia’s brutality, we will continue imposing severe costs to hold President Putin accountable for his utter disregard for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We also will hold to account those involved in his war of choice, including those suspected of taking part in atrocities and human rights abuses against civilians.</p>
<p>Today, the United States, in coordination with our allies and partners, is taking further actions to increase the pressure on the Russian Federation by designating the executives and board members of two of Russia’s most important banks, Sberbank and Gazprombank; a Russian state-owned bank, Moscow Industrial Bank, and 10 of its subsidiaries; and a state-supported weapons manufacturer, Promtekhnologiya.</p>
<p>Further, following our recent port ban, we continue to target Russia’s maritime defense logistics capabilities by designating the Ministry of Defense’s shipping company and six other maritime shipping companies that transport weapons and other military equipment for the Government of Russia, while identifying 69 of their vessels as blocked property.  Additionally, we are designating Fertoing, a specialized marine engineering company that produces remotely operated subsea equipment, among other activities.  Fertoing will now be blocked from accessing critical U.S. technologies.</p>
<p>In addition, the Treasury Department is designating Russia-1, Channel One, and NTV, all of which are directly or indirectly state-owned and controlled media within Russia, spreading disinformation to bolster Putin’s war.  These television stations have been among the largest recipients of foreign revenue, which feeds back to the Russian state.  The United States remains a steadfast champion for media freedom.</p>
<p>We are also taking steps today to impose visa restrictions on over 2,600 Russian and Belarusian military officials who are believed to have been involved in actions that threaten or violate the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of Ukraine.  Included among this group are personnel who reportedly took part in Russian military activities in Bucha, the horrors of which have shocked the world.  We are further announcing a new visa restriction policy targeting Russian Federation military officials and Russian-backed or Russian-installed purported authorities who are believed to have been involved in human rights abuses, violations of international humanitarian law, or public corruption in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In addition to holding the Lukashenka regime accountable for its complicity in enabling the Kremlin’s war, we continue to promote accountability for those involved in the decades-long violent repression of the political opposition in Belarus.  In that context, the State Department has designated three Belarusian officials, Dzmitry Paulichenka, Yury Sivakov, and Viktar Sheiman, pursuant to Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act for their involvement in gross violation of human rights, namely the enforced disappearance of at least one of Lukashenka’s political opponents in 1999.  Under this authority, immediate family members are also ineligible for entry to the United States, to include Viktar Sheiman’s wife, Elena Sheiman, and his adult son, Sergei Sheiman.</p>
<p>Finally, the United States is cutting off Russia’s access to certain key services from U.S. companies that the Russian Federation and Russian elites use to hide their wealth and evade sanctions.  We are prohibiting U.S. persons, wherever located, from providing accounting, trust and corporate formation, and management consulting services to any person located in the Russian Federation, under Executive Order (E. O.) 14071.  We are also identifying the accounting, trust and corporate formation services, and management consulting sectors of the Russian economy pursuant to E.O. 14024, which will allow the United States to target any person who operates or has operated in these sectors of the Russian Federation economy.</p>
<p>Our actions today complement previous steps we have taken with our allies and partners since the beginning of Russia’s unconscionable war.  As long as the Russian Federation continues its aggression against Ukraine, the United States will continue implementing new economic measures against Russia, in particular against its institutions and elites enabling the destruction of entire cities and the killing of thousands of civilians in Ukraine.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Department of State is taking additional actions to hold accountable those engaged in human rights abuses, to impose severe costs on the Government of the Russian Federation (GoR), and to degrade the Kremlin’s ability to support Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine and fund its war of aggression.</p>
<p><strong>Visa Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Today, the Department of State is announcing a series of actions to promote individual accountability for human rights abuses, to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new visa restriction policy under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that applies to Russian Federation military officials and Russia-backed or Russia-installed purported authorities who are believed to have been involved in human rights abuses, violations of international humanitarian law, or public corruption in Ukraine, including in the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” or “Luhansk People’s Republic.” Family members of those who fall under the policy will also be ineligible for visas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Action to impose visa restrictions on 2,596 members of the Russian Federation military and 13 Belarusian military officials pursuant to a policy under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that applies to those who are believed to have supported, been actively complicit in, or been responsible for ordering or otherwise directing or authorizing actions that threaten or violate the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Designation of three Belarusian officials, Dzmitry Paulichenka, Yury Sivakov, and Viktar Sheiman, pursuant to Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2022 for their involvement in a gross violation of human rights. Under this authority, immediate family members are also ineligible for entry to the United States, to include Viktar Sheiman’s wife, Elena Sheiman, and his adult son, Sergei Sheiman.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Targeting Russia’s Maritime Sector</strong></p>
<p>The GoR leverages maritime shipping and other marine sector companies to advance its strategic aims, including by supporting the resupply of its troops and the continuation of its occupationof Crimea, and exploiting and exporting energy reserves.  Today, the Department of State is designating eight Russian maritime-related companies.  This includes the Russian Ministry of Defense’s shipping company, Oboronlogistika OOO, which has been involved in Russia’s illegal seizure and occupation of  Crimea since 2014, as well as private Russian maritime shipping companies that transport weapons and other military equipment for the GoR.  The Department of State also took action against vessels these maritime shipping companies have an interest in with the addition of 69 vessels  to the Department of the Treasury’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.  The Department of State is also designating one maritime engineering company that works with the GoR and Russian state-owned entities. This action serves as a warning to private Russian companies that those who support Putin’s war machine risk severe costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>The Department of State is taking additional actions to hold accountable those engaged in human rights abuses, to impose severe costs on the Government of the Russian Federation (GoR), and to degrade the Kremlin’s ability to support Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine and fund its war of aggression.</p>
<p><strong>Visa Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Today, the Department of State is announcing a series of actions to promote individual accountability for human rights abuses, to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new visa restriction policy under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that applies to Russian Federation military officials and Russia-backed or Russia-installed purported authorities who are believed to have been involved in human rights abuses, violations of international humanitarian law, or public corruption in Ukraine, including in the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” or “Luhansk People’s Republic.” Family members of those who fall under the policy will also be ineligible for visas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Action to impose visa restrictions on 2,596 members of the Russian Federation military and 13 Belarusian military officials pursuant to a policy under Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that applies to those who are believed to have supported, been actively complicit in, or been responsible for ordering or otherwise directing or authorizing actions that threaten or violate the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Designation of three Belarusian officials, Dzmitry Paulichenka, Yury Sivakov, and Viktar Sheiman, pursuant to Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2022 for their involvement in a gross violation of human rights. Under this authority, immediate family members are also ineligible for entry to the United States, to include Viktar Sheiman’s wife, Elena Sheiman, and his adult son, Sergei Sheiman.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Targeting Russia’s Maritime Sector</strong></p>
<p>The GoR leverages maritime shipping and other marine sector companies to advance its strategic aims, including by supporting the resupply of its troops and the continuation of its occupationof Crimea, and exploiting and exporting energy reserves.  Today, the Department of State is designating eight Russian maritime-related companies.  This includes the Russian Ministry of Defense’s shipping company, Oboronlogistika OOO, which has been involved in Russia’s illegal seizure and occupation of  Crimea since 2014, as well as private Russian maritime shipping companies that transport weapons and other military equipment for the GoR.  The Department of State also took action against vessels these maritime shipping companies have an interest in with the addition of 69 vessels  to the Department of the Treasury’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.  The Department of State is also designating one maritime engineering company that works with the GoR and Russian state-owned entities. This action serves as a warning to private Russian companies that those who support Putin’s war machine risk severe costs.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke by phone today with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba to commemorate Ukraine’s Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation to recognize the sacrifices of those lost in World War II.  The Secretary informed Foreign Minister Kuleba that our Charge d’Affaires Kristina Kvien and a small group of diplomats, accompanied by State Department security, traveled to Kyiv to conduct diplomatic engagement in advance of the planned resumption of Embassy Kyiv operations, as the Secretary pledged to President Zelenskyy they would during his most recent visit to Kyiv.  The Secretary also shared additional detail of new security assistance packages to support Ukraine’s gains on the battlefield, including the ninth drawdown from U.S. stocks authorized by President Biden and the expanded authorities that will be offered under the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022.  The Secretary emphasized the United States’ enduring commitment to Ukraine and its ultimate victory against Russian aggression.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>On May 5, the people of Northern Ireland voted in the seventh election for their devolved legislature since the 1998 Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.  The political and economic progress enjoyed over this period is a testament to the benefits of a locally accountable power-sharing government that reflects Northern Ireland’s diverse traditions.</p>
<p>We call on Northern Ireland’s political leaders to take the necessary steps to re-establish a power-sharing executive, which is one of the core institutions established by the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.  Critical and immediate challenges concerning the economy, health, and education are best addressed through the collective efforts of a devolved government chosen by, and accountable to, its people.</p>
<p>The United States enjoys a deep and long-standing relationship with Northern Ireland, grounded in ties of kinship, culture, commerce, and shared values.  We remain deeply committed to preserving the peace dividend of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and will always strive to protect these gains for all communities.  We look forward to continuing our work with democratic partners in Northern Ireland, and with the Governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland, to support peace, prosperity, and stability across the region.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>More than two months into the Kremlin’s unjustified and brutal war, it is impossible not to be moved by what the people of Ukraine have achieved.  It is also impossible not to believe that they will keep succeeding, because they have demonstrated that they have the will and skill to fight.  Despite the suffering they have endured, and the widespread death and destruction that Russia’s brutal and unprovoked war continues to inflict, Ukraine is and will continue to be a free and independent country.</p>
<p>I am authorizing today, pursuant to a delegation from the President, a drawdown to provide further immediate military assistance to Ukraine, valued at up to $150 million worth of additional arms and equipment from U.S. Department of Defense inventories.  This authorization is the ninth drawdown of arms, equipment, and supplies from Department of Defense inventories for Ukraine since August 2021.  This brings total U.S. security assistance to Ukraine to approximately $3.8 billion in arms and equipment since Russia launched its brutal and unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24.</p>
<p>We will continue to provide Ukraine the arms its forces are effectively using to defend their country and the freedom of their fellow citizens.  In addition to military assistance, we also continue to provide direct U.S. financial support to Ukraine, support for documenting evidence of Russia’s atrocities against Ukraine’s civilians, and measures to continue ratcheting up the pressure on Putin’s crumbling economy.  Taken together, these efforts will help strengthen Ukraine’s position at the negotiating table while continuing to isolate Russia from the world until it ends its senseless war of choice on Ukraine.</p>
<p>The United States, our Allies, and our partners are proud to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine in their just cause  ̶  the defense of their country and their democracy.  Together, we will continue to support Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and we will continue to fund humanitarian assistance for those in need.  Ukraine won the battle for Kyiv and we will help Ukraine keep up the fight for as long as it takes. We stand united with Ukraine.</p>

<p><span>The Department of State is offering a reward of up to $10,000,000 for information leading to the identification and/or location of any individual(s) who hold a key leadership position in the Conti ransomware variant transnational organized crime group.  In addition, the Department is also offering a reward of up to $5,000,000 for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of any individual in any country conspiring to participate in or attempting to participate in a Conti variant ransomware incident.</span></p>
<p><span>The Conti ransomware group has been responsible for hundreds of ransomware incidents over the past two years.  The FBI estimates that as of January 2022, there had been over 1,000 victims of attacks associated with Conti ransomware with victim payouts exceeding $150,000,000, making the Conti Ransomware variant the costliest strain of ransomware ever documented.  In April 2022, the group perpetrated a ransomware incident against the Government of Costa Rica that severely impacted the country’s foreign trade by disrupting its customs and taxes platforms.  In offering this reward, the United States demonstrates its commitment to protecting potential ransomware victims around the world from exploitation by cyber criminals.  We look to partner with nations willing to bring justice for those victims affected by ransomware.</span></p>
<p><span>This reward is offered under the Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program (TOCRP).</span></p>
<p><span>The Department manages the TOCRP in close coordination with our federal law enforcement partners as part of a whole of government effort to disrupt and dismantle transnational organized crime globally, including cybercrime.  More than 75 transnational criminals and major narcotics traffickers have been brought to justice under the TOCRP and the Narcotics Rewards Program (NRP) since 1986.  The Department has paid more than $135 million in rewards under these programs to date.</span></p>
