					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Josep Borrell, EU High Representative</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p>Europa Building</p>
<p><b>HIGH REPRESENTATIVE BORRELL:  </b>Good morning.  I – this is going to be a very important council meeting.  We have with us the Secretary of State Tony Blinken.  We already have the ministers of United Kingdom and Canada and the Foreign Minister Kuleba, who will explain to us what is the situation in the ground.</p>
<p>Today, what we see is the ugly phase of war erupting again in our borders, and the Russians are bombing and shelling everything – hospitals, houses, schools, a lot of civilian casualties.  This is a barbarian way of doing war.  And the Human Rights Council will soon launch a mission in order to assess the violations of human rights which is happening in Ukrainian territory.</p>
<p>This is Putin’s war, and Putin has to stop this war.  We remain united.  We know that to ask for this war – stop – to stop and avoid killing of innocent people.  We are providing arms to Ukraine in order to let them defend their soil, their rights, their nation.  We are providing help to the refugees.  Already 1 million people have been crossing our borders, and happily, more will come.  We are putting sanctions that going to really affect the Russian economy, the value of its currency.  It’s going to be having massive effects, as we have already said before.</p>
<p>So sanctions, help the refugees, arms for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves, and stop the violations of human rights, and a strong unity among Europeans and with our partners, transatlantic partners on the NATO framework.  That’s – you are here.  Thank you very much for being with us.</p>
<p><b>SECRETARY BLINKEN:  </b>Thank you, my friend.<b>  </b>It’s hard for me to improve on anything that Josep said, but just to say a couple of things quickly.</p>
<p>First, when President Biden took office a little over a year ago, his first priority was to revitalize, re-energize our alliances and partnerships, starting with the European Union, because of our conviction that we have to be partners of first resort.  Virtually everything that we’re trying to do around the world that’s affecting the lives of our citizens, we’re more effective when we’re doing it together.  And we spent the last year actually making good on that commitment.  And it’s, I think, very, very instructive that now in a time of crisis, the investment that both of us have made in this relationship is proving how important it is, how vital it is.</p>
<p>What the European Union has done over the space of a couple of weeks is quite simply remarkable.  The speed with which it acted, the actions that it took, both with regard to sanctions and also support for Ukraine, are, I think it’s not an exaggeration to say, historic.  And it only further validates for us the importance of this partnership.  As Josep said, we are faced together with what is President Putin’s war of choice – unprovoked, unjustified – and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences for real people, for mothers, for fathers, for children.  We see the images on TV and it has to stop.  We’re committed to doing everything we can to make it stop.</p>
<p>So the coordination between us is vital, but of course it’s beyond the United States and Europe. This is an aggression, a challenge, a threat that is relevant to the entire world, because what’s at risk first and foremost are literally the lives of Ukrainian men, women, and children.  But beyond that, the very fundamental principles that we’ve established together after two world wars that are so important to keeping peace and security for everyone, principles that President Putin is egregiously violating every single day: the notion that one country can’t simply go in and change the borders of another by force or take it over; the principle that one country can’t dictate to another the choices that its citizens would make about their future; the principle that we’re past the time of spheres of influence where one country subjugates its neighbors to its will – all of those things are at stake.  And if we allow those principles to be challenged, as Putin is doing now, with impunity, that will open a Pandora’s box of trouble for not just us, but quite frankly, for the entire world.  So the stakes are high, but because we’re doing this together, I am very confident that we’ll succeed.</p>
<p>I have to say, finally, the two of us have been working like this for many, many months.  And that collaboration, that partnership, that friendship, is also what makes a difference, and I’m really grateful for it.  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>The United States is designating two Hizballah financiers operating in Guinea:  Ali Saade and Ibrahim Taher.  This action will help disrupt Hizballah’s business network in West Africa, which relies on bribery to circumvent the rule of law.</p>
<p>Hizballah has developed a global network of financiers, supporters, donors, and facilitators, enabling the group to constantly threaten the security, stability, and prosperity of Lebanon and the broader region.  The illicit financial activity of those designated today not only supports the terrorist group’s malign activities but also undermines the commercial sector and rule of law in countries where legitimate financial activity takes place.  The United States will continue to expose individuals such as those designated today who support Hizballah’s destabilizing activities.</p>
<p>Today’s designations were taken under Executive Order 13224, as amended, which targets terrorists, leaders, and officials of terrorist groups and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism.  For more information on today’s action, please see the Department of the Treasury’s <a class="external-link" href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0631" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">press release</span><span class="icon-external"> </span></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p>NATO Headquarters</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:</strong>  So Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, welcome to NATO Headquarters.  It’s great have you back here, and thank you for your tremendous leadership and for your tireless efforts in this critical time for our security.  Later on today, NATO defense – NATO foreign ministers will meet and coordinate and consult on our response to the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine and also the longer-term implications.</p>
<p>We condemn the attacks on civilians, and over the night we have also seen reports about the attack against a nuclear power plant.  This just demonstrates the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it and the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops and engage in good faith in diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p>NATO Allies have implemented unprecedented sanctions.  We provide support to Ukraine.  At the same time, NATO is not part to the conflict.  NATO is a defensive alliance.  We don’t seek war, conflict with Russia.  At the same time, we need to make sure that there is no misunderstanding about our commitment to defend and protect our Allies, and therefore we have increased the presence of NATO forces in the eastern part of the Alliance.  This is a defensive presence, and I welcome the strong commitment by – from the United States with more troops.  I met many of them, and it’s always great to meet U.S. troops in Europe and to see their commitment and their professionalism being part of the transatlantic bond.</p>
<p>I also welcome that European allies and Canada are stepping up with more presence in the eastern part of the Alliance on land, at sea, and in the air.  If anything, I think the crisis we are facing now demonstrates the importance of North America standing together in strategic solidarity in NATO.  So once again, Tony, welcome.  It’s great to see you here.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY BLINKEN:</strong>  Jens, thank you so much, and I really couldn’t say it any better.  But simply put, in the wake of Russia’s unprovoked, premeditated aggression against Ukraine, this Alliance came together with speed, with unity, with determination, immediately launching the rapid response task force, putting in place the graduated plans to continue to bolster NATO’s security.  Every Ally in one way or another is coming to Ukraine’s assistance.  Every Ally in one way or another is helping to strengthen NATO itself.  And as the secretary general said, ours is a defensive alliance.  We seek no conflict.  But if conflict comes to us, we are ready for it, and we will defend every inch of NATO territory.</p>
<p>At the same time, as the secretary general said, we’re preparing for NATO’s future.  And the events of the last few weeks as they continue will further inform that future, particularly going into the NATO summit in a few months, and the writing of a new strategic concept.  All of these things are coming together at a critical time.  But the single common denominator that we found, and that is the strength of everything that we do, is the unity of this Alliance.  It’s been on full display in these weeks.  It will remain on full display going forward.  And I look forward to consulting with you, Jens, about the steps we’re going to take next.  Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:</strong>  Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Office of the Spokesperson</p>
<p>Today, U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking and Chargé d’Affaires of the U.S. Embassy to Yemen Cathy Westley concluded their visit to Yemen.  During the trip, they met with the Governors of Hadhramaut, Mahra, and Shabwa.</p>
<p>The visit highlighted how Yemenis across the country &#8211; even those far from the frontlines &#8211; are suffering from years of political and economic instability.  It provided an opportunity to discuss the needs in these governorates and efforts to strengthen basic services, economic opportunity, and security, which would allow peace to take root.  This visit to Yemen also emphasized the continued challenges posed by terrorism and smuggling, which feed instability.</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation stressed its support for an inclusive UN-led peace process that incorporates the views of diverse Yemeni groups, including those from Hadhramaut, Mahra, and Shabwa, as well as women, civil society leaders, and representatives of other traditionally marginalized groups.</p>
<p>The visit to Yemen underscored the importance of the international community continuing to support economic stability and humanitarian relief efforts.  Millions of Yemenis have been displaced by the conflict and rely on international assistance to meet basic needs, including food, health care, and water. The United States has provided over $4 billion in humanitarian assistance for Yemen since the conflict began, and strongly urges donors to generously support the people of Yemen at the upcoming High-Level Pledging Event for Yemen co-hosted by the UN, Switzerland, and Sweden on March 16.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ned Price, Department Spokesperson</p>
<p>With Ukraine’s agreement, the United States and 44 other countries have invoked the OSCE Moscow Mechanism.  This action will establish an expert mission to address our grave concerns regarding the humanitarian and human rights impacts on the people of Ukraine caused by Russia’s further invasion with the support of Belarus.  We have seen the troubling media reports of human rights abuses and violations of humanitarian law by Russia’s forces, including the mounting number of civilian casualties and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure.  The OSCE expert mission will work impartially to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding possible contraventions of OSCE commitments and violations and abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by Russia’s forces.  The expert mission will prepare a report that will be shared with all OSCE participating States and relevant accountability mechanisms, including national, regional, and international courts and tribunals.  The United States and our partners will hold Russia and its forces accountable for all human rights abuses, violations of international humanitarian law, war crimes, and crimes against humanity they commit in Ukraine.</p>

<p><em>Begin Text:</em></p>
<p>We remain committed to the pursuit of a political resolution to the Syrian crisis in accordance with UNSCR 2254 that will protect the rights and dignity of all Syrians.  As we near the 11th commemoration of the peaceful Syrian uprising on March 15, we acknowledge the continued suffering of the Syrian people, which is unacceptable and must end.  We continue to call for a nationwide ceasefire and respect for international humanitarian law, and to stress the importance of unhindered access to life-saving humanitarian assistance through all modalities, including through the re-authorization of cross-border humanitarian aid delivery, to which there is no alternative, as well as cross-line aid and early recovery projects consistent with UNSCR 2585.  We reaffirmed our support for the unity and territorial integrity of Syria and our commitment to the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State</p>
<p>We join in marking World Wildlife Day with many partners around the world. Together, we can conserve the diversity of life on this planet, which is critical for supporting healthy ecosystems.</p>
<p>Many wildlife species are under increasing threats from wildlife trafficking and nature crime. Wildlife trafficking is a security threat and an especially harmful form of transnational organized crime, often with far reaching impacts on nature.  Wildlife trafficking undermines the rule of law, facilitates corruption, deprives communities of legitimate livelihoods and natural resources, and contributes to the spread of disease.</p>
<p>As we seek to end the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States also endeavors to strengthen global health systems and health security including through promoting the One Health approach.  Strengthening the One Health approach will require tackling the upstream drivers of zoonotic disease risks such as illegal deforestation and wildlife trafficking.</p>
<p>We know what is possible when we work to conserve biodiversity.  As just one example, thanks to decades of hard work, our national symbol – the bald eagle – has been brought back from the brink of extinction and is no longer endangered.  The United States remains committed to leading global efforts to secure the continued existence of protected wildlife in their natural habits by conserving ecosystems, protecting biodiversity, and combating wildlife trafficking.  Together, we will continue to make sure that biodiversity – including species such as rhinos, tigers, and pangolins – continues to thrive.</p>
<p>We are currently facing the twin crises of biodiversity loss and climate change, adding pressure to ecosystems and their ability to function.  The Administration’s <a class="external-link__pdf" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Plan_to_Conserve_Global_Forests_final.pdf" target="_BLANK" rel="noopener"><span class="external-link-title">Plan to Conserve Global Forests: Critical Carbon Sinks</span><span class="filesize icon-pdf"> </span></a> released late last year details a whole-of-government approach to conserving, restoring, and sustainably managing forests and other ecosystems at home and abroad in order to combat these crises and ensure intact forests can continue to support wildlife.</p>
